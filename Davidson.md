PREFACE TO THE TENTH EDITION.

^T^HE necessity for another Edition of

this Introductory

Grammar leads me to hope that it has been found

useful to beginners in Hebrew, and that the attempt made

in

it

to combine a statement of

the

principles

of the

language with progressive exercises for practice upon them

has not altogether failed.

In this Edition some parts in previous ones that appeared

too brief and obscure have been made fuller and simplified

;

examples have been added, where wanting, and some addi-

tional Tables and Paradigms introduced.

It is hoped that

these changes will be found to be improvements.

Some irregularity in the grammatical order of the sections

has naturally been occasioned by the

requirements of an

Exercise Book.

It was necessary, for example, to introduce

the Inseparable Prepositions and the Conjunction at an early

stage, and also to make the First Declension of Nouns precede

the Verb, in order to have materials for the construction of

sentences ;

but the

proper grammatical order

has been

followed as closely as possible, and the outline of Grammar

has been kept distinct from the Exercises, in order that, if

desired, it may be used without them.

I have to express my thanks to

several

scholars and

teachers who have kindly offered me useful suggestions and

corrections, particularly the Kev. J. T. Fowler, Vice-Trincipal

of Bishop Hatfield's

Hall, and Hebrew Lecturer in

the

University of Durham ; and to ]\Ir. J. Iverach Munro, who

has greatly helped me by reading the proofs.

§ 1. HEBREW ALPHABET.

1. These 22 letters are all consonants Hebrew is written

from right to left.

2. The letter k expresses simply the emission of the
breath. It may be well heard if in such words as ye'esoph^
yo'oinar, the stream of sound of the first vowel be suddenly
shut off, and the second vowel uttered with a new emission
of breath.

The letter n had probably two sounds, one rough like
ch in the Scotch word loch, and another a smooth deep
sound of h very difficult to produce.

The letter j? had also two sounds, the one a sharp gut-
tural sound, bearing the same relation to « that n bears to
the simple n, the other a vibratory palatal sound like the
French r.

These three letters, along with p, represent peculiar She-

mitic sounds.

3. Six of the letters have a double pronunciation. The
difference is indicated by a point in the bosom of the letter,
thus: n ^ T D D n have the sounds hh (v), gh, dh (th in this\
kh (ch in loch), ph, ih (in think), but 2 5 '^ &c. have the ord-
inary sounds of h g dkp t. This point is called Daghesh (§ 7).
4. The letter i is sounded by most Scholars like rv though

some give it the sound of v.

The Ungual sound t3 t is produced by pressing the flat of

the tongue to the top of the mouth.

The sign ^ Shin sounds sh; ly Sin sounds s, and so D.
5. The five letters k m n p c^ have each two signs, of
wliich the second is used when the letter is the last con-
sonant of a word. iVU the finals except m have a tail coming
l)elow the line, and no other letter except qoph comes below
the line.

6. The letters and signs in the column marked "sound and
sign", Table p. 1, are those for the most part notv adopted
to represent the Hebrew letters, and should he employed in

transliteration into English.

^ The sound of this letter was probably a strong flat sa; but the Alphabet
ha<! so many s sounds that the traditional ts may be retained for the sake
of distinction.

Rem. a. On 2. The clear sound of ^ is represented in the Sept.
by the spiritus asper or lenis of the Greeks (the former of which is
now generally adopted as the sign of the letter), and the garghng
sound by the letter 7.
It is decidedly
wrong to represent either of its sounds by the nasal 7ig.

Cf. Gen. 2. 8; 10. 21; 10. 19.

Rem. b. Observe how the following letters are distinguished: D b
has a foot-stroke going behind, D A: is round and ^ n square, while
i ^ is broken at the foot; T d is square at the top, and *1 r is round;
n A is open at the top, H h is shut, and Jl th has a foot at the left;
^ 1/ does not touch the line, "1 ^v does, t z has a cross-stroke at the
top, while ] final n comes under the line; D s is round and D final m
is square; t3 ^ is open at the top and tt tn open at the foot.

§ 2. VOWEL SOUNDS. VOWEL LETTERS.

1. Vowel .Sounds. The three primary vowel sounds in
Hebrew, as in other languages, are A I U (pronounced oJ/
ee 00) which pass through the following modifications:

This table is not exhaustive, but it contains the main

elements of the system. See the Rem. on p. 4.

1) Pure short vowels. The first line exhibits the three
primary vowel sounds a i u; and the second line the de-
flection of these into related short sounds. The vowel a

have now at least equal currency with i u.

4

§ 2. VOWEL SOUNDS. VOWEL LETTERS,

2) Pure long vowels. The pure long vowels a i u may be
supposed to arise from the pure short by simple extension
or duplication; or by short vowels coalescing with «/, w, as
iij = i^ urv = u. The pure long a is less common than the
others, 6 being often found instead of it.

3) Diphthongal long voivels. Another class of long vowels
are the diphthongal, e 6, which have arisen from the vowel

a coming before i and w, or before y and w, thus

"^ ^

\

[ = 0.

Hebrew hardly uses the diphthongs at and au

(the sounds in huy and horv)^ preferring, like English and
French, the sounds e and o instead of them.^

4) Tone-long and indistinct vo?vels. The great strength of
the Accent or Tone in Hebrew seems to affect short vowels
in two ways: on the one hand it extends those in its im-
mediate neighbourhood, giving rise to the vowels called
tone-long a e 6; and on the other hand it greatly shortens
those at a distance from it, giving rise to a class of sounds,
which, though vocalic, are too brief and indistinct to per-
form the functions of real vowels. The commonest of these
indistinct sounds is a very short indefinite sound, nearest

perhaps to e in the syllable he of believe, — represented by
the small ' above the line;^ but others approach so much
towards distinctness that their affinity to one or other of
the three vowels a e o can be detected; they are a. e 6.

Eem. In the above Table the letters A I U indicate the three
primary, generic vowel sounds, and the small letters the actual vowel
sounds of the hmguage. The notation adopted is convenient. The
pure long and diphthongal vowels (both of which ai-e unchangeable)
are indicated by the circumflex, a &c. ; the tone-long vowels (which are
changeable) by the long mark, a &c.; the indistinct vow^els by the
short mark, a &c.; while the simple short vowels remain unmarked.

2.

Vocalization.

All the Shemitic Alphabets consisted

originally of consonantal signs only (§ 1. 1).
It is charac-
teristic of their first efforts towards vocalization to make
^ The sounds ay often combine into an open c with the tone, instead

of forming the more extended e.

e. g. knie i. e. k^nie.

considerably in the degrees of completeness to which they
have developed this method of vocalization.

3. The consonants used in Hebrew for this purpose are
1 n N, which on account of this use have sometimes been

^

called voivel letters^ thus:

1) The guttural, or a sound was indicated by the gut-
tural letter Aleph, when not final (though indication of
non-final a was rare), and sometimes when final.

Final a was chiefly indicated by He.

2) The palatal, or i and e sounds were indicated by the

weak palatal Yod.

Final e was often indicated by He^ but not final i.

3) The labial, or u and o sounds were indicated by the

weak labial Vav.

Final o was often indicated by He, but not final u.

Briefly: i and e (medial and final) were represented by ''

(medial and final)
u and
all finals (except i and u)

n

Rem. In this textual vocalization, vowels of the second class (i
anil e) and of the third class (u and o) were almost always indicated
by the vowel letters, when final, less uniformly wlicu medial; in the
latter case they were often so indicated when dipMhongal, also when
pure long {cot u), but not when tone-long (e oj, nor when short,
VoAvels of the first class (a sounds) were rarely indicated when not
final, and not uniformly even when final.^

letters are genei-al; their use can hardly be understood without a know-

used at first chiefly at the end of words, e.g. to mark pronominal suffixes
(§ 19) and inflectional tei'minations, which were important for the sense.
2. In the middle of words they Avere chiefly used where iv and y were
elements of the word, e. g. formed diphthongs afterwards pronounced as
vowels, or characterized the root (Ayin Vav and Yod verbs, §40). 3. Later
their use was extended to mark long vowels in general.—There is thus
a great Avant of uniformity in the usage. In general they are most em-
ployed towards the end of words, and when the same long vowel occurs
twice in a word it is usually only once written fully.—The representation
of final a by AJcph is mostly late (usual in Aramaic), Num. 11. 20. Is. 19. 17,
Ez. 27 31 ; 31. b ; 36. 5, Ru. 1. 20, Lam. 3. 12, Ps. 127. -2., Dan. 11. 44.

§ 3. EXTERNAL VOWEL SIGNS. THE. MASSOEETIC
POINTS.

L So long as Hebrew was a living language, the helps
to vocalization described in § 2. 3, though scanty, might
be found sufficient. But when the language ceased to be
spoken and became unfamiliar, fuller representation of the
vowels was needful for correct reading. This necessity, in
combination with the literary activity of the time, gave
rise to the present very complete system of vowel signs.

As the pronunciation of the language was not expressed by
signs but handed down by tradition, this tradition became an
important branch of study. The word for "tradition" is Massorah,
under which term was embraced the whole Textual Criticism of
the Scriptures, including the vocalization and reading. Hence
Ihose who employed themselves about this have been called
Massoretes, and the new system of vowel signs introduced by
them is named the Massoretic System of Points.

The history of this system is difficult to trace. The names of
its authors are quite unknown. So complicated and perfect a

machinery of signs could have been matured only very slowly
and by successive generations of labourers. The system probably
dates from the sixth and following centuries; neither Jerome
(d. 420) nor the Talmud (c. 500 A.D) appears to know anything
of vowel sig7is. Being the result of a formal scientific effort to

express the pronunciation of the language, it is, like all systems

of vowel notation arising in similar circumstances, completely
phonetic ; the new signs, however, are not regarded as integral

parts of the word and are not placed among the consonants, hut,

with rare exceptions, beneath or above them, outside the word.

The names given to the vowel signs probably have some
reference to the action of the mouth in uttering the sounds.

These sounds are contained in the first syllable of most of the
names. The signs have probably all arisen by various modi-

fications from the single point or dot.

§ 3. EXTERNAL VOWEL SIGNS. THE MASSORETIC POINTS.

1) The vowels in the English words annexed probably
pretty well correspond to the Hebrew vowels, e. g. -;^ =
the a in small; -^ = the « in fat &c. The notation «, a, «,
t', e &c. in the above Table is the same as that in Table

§ 2, p. 3.

2) Lo7ig and Short signs. There are five short signs, viz.
^, -^ (short), -7-, -::-, and — ; and five long, viz. — , -^
(long), -^ or -7- (long), -77-, and -^. When this Table is
compared with that in § 2, to which it corresponds, it will
be seen that the Massoretes invented only one sign for any
long vowel sound, expressing a pure long, diphthongal,
and tone long sound by the same symbol.^

The representation of the vowels i and u was also

thought sufficient to represent both its long and short
sounds, as wvp^n hish-?m-dhdm (he destroyed them). Short u
is expressed by qibhuc, as ]nb^ shul-hdn (a table). Long u
was usually already represented in the text by vav.^ in
which a point was inserted, forming shureq, as Dip, qum,
pointed Dip (to arise). When vav was not already expressed
u was indicated by qibbiic, as Dp, qiim, pointed Dp.^

3) Indistinct vowels.

Sh^va simple and composite.

The
name sh'^va, a word of doubtful meaning, was given to that

is so indistinct that the class of vowel to which it belongs
cannot be detected, and hence it is common to the three
classes.

See § 6, Table d.

The other three indistinct vowels approached so much
towards distinctness that the class of vowel sound to which
tliey belonged could be detected, though they did not reach
the rank of full vowels § 2. 1. 4). They thus seemed to

^ In other words their system was phonetic simply not etymological.
^ It is considered an anomaly by the punctuators when short m is re-
])resented in the text by x:av, and attention is drawn to it in a note, e. g.
Gen. 2. 25, Is. 51. 4, Ps. 102. 5. The same is the case when short
is re-
presented by vav, e. g. 2 Sam. 13. 8, Is. 18. 4, and also when short i is re-
presented by yod, e. g. 1 Sam. 17. '6b, Pro v. 30. 17.

stand midway between the simple sh^va and true vowels,
and are indicated by signs compounded of simple sli'^va
and the three short vowels, -^, -7:7, — . Hence they are
often named Coj/iposite sh^vas.
Being also vocalic sounds
perceptibly of the nature of the short vowels they are often
called swift or hurried short vowels: Mieph palhah^ hfiteph
fghol, hdtcph qamec. This peculiar degree of vowel sound
was heard chiefly in connexion with the consonants called
rjutlurah, § 8.^

Rem. The sign of simple sli'^^va is also put under every consonant
without a vowel of its own, if it be sounded and not final, § 5. 6. The
sh'^va in this position is called silent^ having no sound.

4) Position of the vowel sign.

The vowel sign stands
under the consonant after which it is pronounced, as ^5 &«A
not, "i»i namcr, a Jeopard; with the exception oiholem^ which
stands over the left corner of the consonant which it fol-

defect in the Massoretic system is its failure to distinguish by sign

^ When holem precedes the letter N as a quiescent the point is placed

4. Another kind of syllable, not uncommon, is the half
It has a short unaccented vowel, but the consonant
open.
that would naturally close it is pronounced with a slight
vowel sound after it, and thus hangs loosely between this
syllable and the one following, e. g. VcJips hiqtol, in killing;
which is not biq-tol nor bi-q°tdl. Half open syllables are
generally the result of inflectional changes or composition

(§ 6. 2 d).

5. Beginning of the syllable.

Every syllable must begin
with a consonant. No syllable can begin with more than
two consonants. When a syllable begins with two con-
sonants these must be separated by the slight vocalic sound
indicated by sh*'va simple or composite, which is placed
under the first, as ^tip q^tal, ""jp'^n hdlo-mi, my dream.

Thus the place of sh^va vocal, simple or composite, is under

the first of two consonants that begin a syllable.

^ It is understood that the tone or accent is the stress of the voice, and
the tone-syllable is the syllable of the word on which the stress falls,
e. g. in the noun present the first syllable is the tone-syllable, in the verb
to present, the last syll. has the tone.

^ Observe that we speak of long and short vowels in Heb., but not of

long and short syllables; the syllable is shut or open.

12

§ 5. PRINCIPLES OF THE SYLLABLE. READING.

6. E?i(l of the syllable. A syllable may end in a vowel or
consonant, that is be either open or shut (No. 2). None
but a final syllable can end in more than one consonant;
and a final in not more than two, and the two cannot be
a double letter.

Simple sh'va silent is placed imder the co?isonant that ends
the syllable, if the consonant be sounded and not the last
letter of a word, as "^ispD miq-tdl. A consonant not sounded
(i. e. quiescent) does not take sh°va^ as rc^t^"] re-shith; nor
yet a single final consonant, except kaph which takes sh'^va
in its bosom, as w& shfwi, but "rj'? lakh; but two sounded
consonants at the end of a word both take sh'^va, as ptyp
qosht, ptyi yashq.

Rule for placing Sh^va. The rules in 5 and G regarding
sh^va (simple and composite alike) may be put briefly thus:
S¥va (simple or composite) is to he placed under every con-
sonant without a full vowel of its own, if the consonant be
sounded (not quiescent) and not the single final letter of a
word. When two consonants end a word, the last has
sli^'va only when the first has it (by first part of the rule),
as ^^'p qosht., but nMnp"? liq-rath.

§ 0. THE VOWEL SYSTEM AND THE TONE.

The following table gives a pretty complete view of the
various vowel signs. It is the same as that in § 2, though
the classes of vowels are placed in a different order to
shew better some points of connexion between them.^

^ Some signs are omitted to avoid confusion e.g. e ''—^, a sound difficult
to classify, being generally of diphthongal origin but of sharp short sound.
The principles of this § are of fundamental importance but not more than

a I u e 0, Table cd., § 2. The pure short vowels also, stand-
ing generally in shut syllables (§ 5. 3), are from position
unchangeable. They are a i u e o. Table ab, § 2.

2. Changeable votvels. The most important vowels in re-
ference to inflection are those in the third line called Tofie-
long, a, e, o, Table ^, § 2, that is vowels not long by nature
but from occupying a certain position in relation to the
place of tone (§ 5. 1, and footnote)., and therefore changeable,
when their relation to the tone alters, by change in the
place of accent.

With the tone-long vowels, which are vowels long through
their relation to the place of tone, must be taken the sh^vas
or imperfect vowels * « e o § 2, which are short from their
relation to the tone. And the pure short vowels when
they do not stand in shut syllables, come also into con-
nexion with the tone long. The following particulars will
here suffice:

a) There are only three tone long vowels, a e o, one for
each class ; a tone-lengthened hweq is not hireq but cere,
and a tone-lengthened qibhuc is holem, Table b c.

In like manner besides the simple sli^va common to all
classes, there are only three composite sh'^vas, which are the ex-

treme short sounds, a e o, oi the same three vowels a e o, oi
which the tone long are the extended sounds, Table d e.

b) Tone long vowels are produced by proximity to the
tone, and are found in the open syllable immediately before

Second,in opposition to law 2 c the indistinct vowel stands in certain
cases next the tone. This is so characteristic of verbs, that it may be
named the verbal law of inflection (§§ 20, 30). Thus the noun inflects

Eem. d. On 2 d. When two indistinct vowels come together and
the first becomes a short vowel, the second retains so much of its
vocalic quality that the syllable formed is usually not fall siiut but
half open. Such a syllable has these peculiarities : first, as it is not a
shut syllable, one of the B^ghadhk^phath letters following it will not
receive Dag. lene (§ 7. 2); second, as it is not open, its own vowel
will not usually receive Metheg (§ 10. 2).

Half open syllables having a special emphasis, as those arising
from the H of interrogation, §49; the Article § 11, not unfrequently
are marked by Metheg.^

§ 7. DAGHESH. THE LETTEES "BEGHADHKEPHATH".
(ASPIRATES).

1. The word Daghesh is from a root whicli possibly ex-
pressed the idea of hardness. The sign of Daghesh is a
point in the bosom of a letter, and this point was used to
indicate both a lighter and a heavier kind of hardness.
When it indicates the lighter hardness it is called D. lene,
when the stronger, it is called D. forte.

^ These half-open or loose syllables are important in Hebrew; a list
of the chief of them may be given in a note for reference merely. First,
such syllables are those arising by composition; e. g. 1) •wliQxi particles or
short fragments of words are prefixed to other words, as the Interrogative
n, §49; i\ie Article and Yav Convcrsive, when their Daghesh is omitted,
§ 11 Rem. a, § 26 Rem. rt; the Inseparable Frepositions, § 14. The prep.
b to generally unites so closely with the Infm. Cons, that the syllable
formed is shut, § 31. 2) when fragmentary particles are affixed to words,
as the consonantal suffixes to nouns, § 19; and all suffixes to the Infin.
Cons, and Imperat. qal of Verbs, § 31. In all these cases the feeling of
the diversity of elements remains, preventing complete coalescence of the
word and attached particle. Second, of this kind are the new syllables that
arise when vowels are lost through change of place of Tone in processes of
pi. 1D"I"! ,§21;
Inflection, e. g. a) in the Imperat. qal of Verbs, as »']'T1
b) in certain forms of the Guttural Verb, as nb^^ pi. nnj;^ § 34. Rem. 6;
c) in Nouns, particularly in the cons, plur., § 18. 1 Rem. b, and in the
feminine with affixes, e. g. ''?'?0, ''ri313 malkhc, birkJidtJn. Third, the first

2. Daghesh lene. Hebrew has not two sets of consonants
for the sounds h g d k p t and their softer forms hh, gh,
dh &c. It distinguished the sounds by means of the point
Daghesh (§ 1. 3). The harder sounds it expressed by insert-
ing the point, as 2 &, r\ t &c., leaving the unmodified con-
sonant to express the weaker, hh, th &c. The softer sounds
were natural or easy only after vowels; hence the rule:

The six letters n D 3 1 5 2 (ire hard and therefore have
Daghesh lene whenever they do not immediately follow a
vowel sound, iDt zd-khar, "i2r yiz-kbr. — Hence these letters

receive the point: always at the beginning of a sentence or
clause; always in the middle of a word after a shut syll.;
and generally at the beginning of words.

Rem. The rule put as above is exhaustive ; it may be put
thus: The six Aspirates are without Daghesh 07ili/ ivhen they

simple sh^va vocal, preceding, suffices to enable the letter to

have its softer sound, as "lit z^khor.

^ The diphthongs e. g. ai,

Daghesh. See § 9. Cf. Gen. 16. 8, Lev. 2. 14, The divine name mn\ being
pronounced 'adhondi, is followed by Dag.—The above rule in 2 ia liable
to modifications in words beginning with B^ghadh¥phath though imme-
diately preceded by words ending in a vowel sound, when euphony
would suffer through several aspirates coming together. The prefixes

such as D2, D3, D3, and according to some ttB, receive Dag. lene con-
trary to the rule, cf. Gen. 39. 12, Jud. 1. 14,1 Sam! 16. 6, Is. 10. 9, Josh. 8. 24,
Ex. 14. 4, Ps. 34. 2, Gen. 32. 11; 40. 7. Dag. is inserted in other cases
irregularly
to avoid the concurrence of aspirates, e. g. Ex. 15 21,
Deut. 32. lo, or uneuphouic combinations of sounds (see Baer-Del.,
Prov., pref.).

hardness which is duplication, it inserts in it a point, as
^Vj5 qal-lu. When so used the point is called D. forte.

Rem. Of necessity a double letter must be preceded by a vowel,
and as it always forms a shut syllable, the vowel before it is gener-
ally short § 5. 3. In this way D. lene which is never preceded by a
vowel can hardly be confounded with D. forte. Much of the beauty
of Shemitic pronunciation depends on the extreme strength with
which it enunciates the double letter. The Arabic double letter, and
no doubt the Hebrew too, is more decided than the Italian. In
Hebrew a long vowel is long, and a short vowel, short, and a double
letter is a double letter. But see note below on 4.

4. D. lene is peculiar to the six B^ghadhk^phath ; any letter
may be doubled, and have D. /or^e, except the gutturals

^ Some additional details regarding It. forte must be given for reference.
a) Omission of D. forte. The language shews a tendency towards a
softer enunciation by dropping the characteristic duplication in the
middle of words from consonants not supported by a fiul vowel i. e.
pointed with sh'^va vocal. This softer utterance occurs very frequently
with yod and the liquids, I, m, n, and the letter p, but is not confined to
these, and may occur even with the so called Aspirates or B'^gliadhk'^phath
e. g. Lev. 23. 24. The syllable that arises by loss of the duplication is
half open §5.4; e.g. H^iO? lamnar-Qeah, for 'fib lam-m^na^-reahf
D'l^i'jpno m^bhaqshhn, for b"*^'|?nD m^bliaq-q'^shim. Gen. 27. 28, Ex. 2. 3;
S. l,Jud. 8. 2.

h) Insertion of D. forte. D. forte dirimens. The opposite tendency to
the above in a) sometimes shews itself, viz. the tendency to pronounce
half open syllables more distinctly. The loose consonant is more firmly
grasped in utterance and the two syllables between which it hung are
sharply disjoined, so that a doubling of the consonant is the effect. The
Dag. marking this has been called D. dirimens or separative Gen. 17. 17.
Deut. 32. 32, "^2^)} {cons.pl., note p. 17), 'inbhe, with Dag. dir. ^^i^J?
in-n^bhe. This duplication occurs properly only in half open syll., but
a more refined pronunciation may make a real shut syll. half open (as
fc<B^"jri Gen. 1. 11), and such a syll. may then be further subjected to the
influence of D. dirimens, as tJ^nj?)?; Ex. 2. 3 ; 15. 17, Gen. 49. 10, 1 Sam. 1. 6;
10. 24, Job 17. 2.

is called Mappiq, as r\b.

The last two are much stronger
of the same kind as n.
Being but breathings these
letters than the other two.
letters approach a good deal towards vowels, and this
feebleness in consonantal power causes the following pe-

culiarities :

1. The gutturals prefer about them, particularly before
them, the guttural or a vowels, and a final guttural must
be preceded by pathah or qamec.

Pathah furtive. Any short vowel before a final guttural
becomes pathah; and between any long vowel (other than
qameg) and the final guttural there steals in, in utterance,
the sound of short a. This short a is therefore called path.
furtive. Thus "jj^o but n'po; '^"'^K'«1 but H'^'pti^n hish-liah.

2. The gutturals cannot take simple sh^va vocal, they
require the composite sh'vas; in many cases they dislike
simple shVa silent, preferring the composite, e. g. Iij5 but

^. "lbs? ; 'by\ but 'h^'^.

"^3. A guttural letter points itself and the consonant
preceding:— that is a guttural with a hateph turns a pre-

ceding simple sh'va vocal into the short vowel corresponding
to the hateph; e. g. ni^"? becomes "ibyb.

4. The gutturals cannot be doubled. In this jpeculiarity
resh agrees with the gutturals. Hence the short vowel that
would precede the guttural were it doubled (§ 7. 3 Rem.)
falls into an open syllable before the undoubled letter and
becomes the corresponding tone long vowel (^5.3; §6.

the vowels follow the gutt.; e. g. b'^r\\ for h'T>\] nVij; for nb^J?.
The letter t^ (being a quiescent also, see §9.1 E,em. a) is
excepted from this rule. The letter "1 often agrees with J^nH
in desiring pathah before it when final, but it is not subject to

the rule oi path, furtive.

The sign of path, furtive is written under the final gutt., but

the sound is heard before it, as nn ruah, spirit.
Path, furtive
is not counted as a vowel, and, of course, disappears when the
e. g. ri''7!i^n has only two vowels,
gutt. ceases to be final;
i and i; its fern, is T\'^,'h^l^. So ^ni"! mp spirit.

Rem. b. On 2. By far the most common hateph is ^—
Initial S is fond of -^7- immediately before the tone, but at
a distance from the tone it reverts to ^-, as 'h^ but DS'^bs.

The hateph that takes the place of silent slfva always corres-

ponds to the preceding short vowel, as "hV"^ (for ^bj^S)-

The second half of the rule applies chiefly to syllables not
in the tone, and the process is facilitated by the law stated
in Rem. o whereby the gutt. depresses i li, io e 0, e. g. *1!2Ki =
Ifit^i =s "l^Ni.
This softer enunciation shews itself chiefly
with the weak gutturals J^ t^, the harder H H often retain the
simple sh'^va silent.

§ 9. THE QUIESCENT LETTERS.

The letters m n X shew the same kind of feebleness that
the letters h w y, that correspond to three of them, have
in English: they frequently coalesce in various ways with
the vowel sounds about them."

1. They are real consonants at the beginning of a syl-
lable , but at the end of a syllable after a full vowel they
generally surrender their consonantal jiower and are silent;
e. g. "10« 'd-mar, but nfiN" yo-mar; ^a'' ij^me, but 1013 I)i-?ne.
They do not modify the sound of the vowel before them
when silent, though it is often lengthened, particularly if
it be of the first or third class.
Sh^va is not placed under
the silent consonant (§ 5. 6).

either medial or final.

§ 9. THE QUIESCENT LETTERS

The letter H is silent perhaps in a pair of cases when
medial, and when final is the mere sign of a vowel sound

(§ 2. 3).

Rem. b. The letter "I is silent after the o and u sounds (tJiird
class), and generally after the a sound (first class), with which
it coalesces and forms the diphthongal y (§ 2. 1. 3)). In a few
cases 1 is consonantal after the a sound, as 1^ r av. The suffixal
After vowels
form V—^ is sounded uv (§ 19), as VD1D su-sCiv.
of the second class (i, e) ) is sounded, as IT ziv.

The letter ^ is silent after the i and e sounds (second class),
and generally after the a sound, with which it unites to form

the diphthongal e (§ 2. 1. 3)).

In a few cases ^ is consonantal after a, as in the suffixal

form "I-:— (pausal ^-7-), which is sounded ay (dee), as "'DID,

su-sdee (§ ID).

After vowels of third class (0, u), "• is sounded, as ""IH hoy

(hoee), ''r?^ gdluy (gd-loo-ee).
2. Even at the beginning of a syllable immediately after a consonant
these letters can hardly maintain themselves: they generally surrender
their vowel to the preceding vowelless consonant, and quiesce after the
vowel which they have given up, or even fall out of the form altogether,
thus yaqwim=ya-qim, yaq7oum=ya-qum, hiishwnb=hu-shab, yehaqtll=
yaqtil, r^'dshim = rashtm.

3. When the letters w y stand between two vowels they many times
are lost in the vowel stream surrounding them; they disappear and the
two vowels are represented by that one which being characteristic of
the form was the stronger, which is generally the latter of the two; or
the two vowels coalesce and form a new sound. Thus, qawam=:qum,
maiveth = meth, qanmm = qum. So h sometimes, st(sahic=susd.

4. One of the weak letters V) y may be changed into another under
the influence of a strong preceding characteristic vowel resolved to
maintain itself: the weak letter passes into another homogeneous to the
vowel, yivrash —yiyrash =yt-rash,

§ 10. THE ACCENTS. METHEG &c. PAUSE.

1.

Use of the Accents.

The accents have three uses:
1) they mark the tone-syllable; 2) they are signs of logical
interpunction, like our comma &c. ; and 3) they are musical
expressions. In the first case they are guides to the pronun-
ciation of the individual words; in the second they arc
guides to the sense, being a kind of commentary; and in
the third they are guides to the proper reading of the text
as a whole, which is a kind of recitative or cantillation.
The last use, of course, embraces the other two.

2. The secondary accent {Metheg) and the Tone. The main
accent or Tone falls generally upon the last syllable of the
word (§5.1); in one class of nouns (the Segholates § 29),
and in some Verbal forms, it falls on the penult.^

a) According to the natural rhythm of the language the
syllable immediately before the Tone has a fall, but the
syllable second from the Tone a certain emphasis or ac-
centual rise. To prevent this emphasis or anti-tone being
neglected the syllable was often marked by a sign called
Metheg (bridle), a small perpendicular stroke. An open
syllable was most apt to be hurried over, and hence: the
second full syllable from the Tone, if open, is uniformly
marked by Metheg, as ^b:«, ri"iDp,, Q^nn.

b) When the tone syllable begins with two consonants, the
indistinct vowel under the first is strong enough to bear
the accentual fall, and the preceding open syllable is marked
with Metheg, n^'DtJ 'd-kh^ldh, she ate.
In such positions
Metheg indicates that the slfva is vocal, and thus serves

^ Of the accentual signs some stand above, and some below the word;
when above, the sign stands upon the initial cons, of the accented syll.,
as D''b ; when below, it stands after the vowel of the syll., as 0"*^, except
in the case of holem and shureq, when it is placed under the conson.,
as UV, nn. "When the accented syll. begins with two conss. the sign is
put on the second. A few signs are restricted to particular positions,
such as the initial or final letter of a word, and do not indicate the
Tone syll. For more information on these and other points see my
Outlines of Hebrew Accentuation.

to distinguish between a and o, and between i and /, and
u and m; e. g. n'jSS 'okh-lah, food\ !i«T yi-r^'u, they will fear \
Wl.l yir-'u, they will see.

If the vocal sh\a in this case be a hateph^ the preceding
vowel though 5^or^ has that distinctness that requires to
be preserved by Metheg, '^'f^..

Rule for placing 3Ietheg.—(1) The second full

syllable

from the Tone, if open, receives Metheg.
(2) Before simple
sheva the five long vowels aiu e o have Metheg ; and before
a composite sheva all vowels have Metheg.

c) If the second from the Tone be a shut syll.,

it will be

pronounced with sufficient distinctness without the aid of Metheg

in such a case, if there be an open syll. fiu'ther from the Tone, this

is felt to require Metheg to prevent too hurried utterance, as

]nnVntt1 Gen. 4. 4; Ezek. 42. 5.

d) If the word be long the Metheg already placed may be
taken as a new tone, and another Metheg may fall two syllables

from it, as niilD^nnOil Ezek. 42. 5.

The conjunction ^ and, being a weak sound, very rarely takes

Metheg.^

^ The above rules give the main facts about Metheg. The results of
a very full investigation into the Massoretic laws of Metheg have been
given out by S. Baer in two Articles on Metheg-Setzung in Merx's
According to Baer Metheg is of three kinds; first,
ArcMv i,i\, 1869.
light,— the object of which is to secure to vowels their full breadth of
sound; second, heavy, — the object of which is to ensure to a syllable its
special emphasis; third, articulative,—the object of which is to ensure
that a consonant be enunciated distinctly and not run into another.

Again, light M. is of two kinds ; first, ordinary—placed on the second
syll. from the Tone, if the syll. be open, i. e. not followed by Dag. forte
nor any Sh^va. See the exx. above in No. 2, a. To this ordinary M. applies
what is said above in 2, a. Second, stationary (feststehend)— placed on
the five long vowels (§ 6, Tab. o) wlien followed by simple Sh^va, and on
all vowels, long or short, when followed by a composite Sh'^va.

Examples of heavy M. occur in the case of the Art. when its Dag. is
omitted (§11. Rem. a); with the H of Interrogation (§ 49. comp. Rem. d
e. g. Hj^nii Ps. 2. 3.
p. 17).
Examples of the articulative M. in Gen. 28. 2 &c., DIS Hi'^D. These laws
are not observed in printed Edd. but are followed in Bacr's Ed. of
Genesis, Psalms, and Isaiah, &c.

This M. may stand on simple sh'^va,

3. The Accentual system. The Accentual system is very intri-
cate and in some parts obscure. A brief outline of its uses as a
means of interpunction will here suffice:

a) The text is broken into verses, P^suqtm, and the end of
each Pdsuq is marked by the sign i, called Soj^h pasuq (end of the
verse). The accent on the final word is called Silltiq, its sign being

like Metheg.

Gen. 1. 1.

b) The greatest logical pause within the verse is indicated

by a sign called 'Athndh ''breathing", or "rest".

:psn

n\l'bN

Gen. 1. 1.

c) If there be two great pauses in the verse the greatest or
one next the end of the verse is marked by 'Athnah, and the one
nearer the beginning of the verse by sign called $^goltd, as,

• Gen. 1. 7.

d) If the clause of words lying between Silluq and Athnah,
or between Athnah and Segolta, or between Athnah and the be-
ginning of the verse, Segolta being absent, requires to be divided
by a pretty large pause, this is in all these cases marked by a sign
called Zdqeph qdton, resembling simple sh^va placed over the
word,^ as

e) A distinctive of less power than Zakeph is Tiphhd, which
marks a pause wliicli the rhythm requires as a preliminary to
tlie great pauses indicated by Silluq and 'Athnah.

'Athnah and Zaqeph. See Gen. 1. 1,2.

g) The books Job, Proverbs and Psalms have an accentuation
in some respects different from that of the other books, called the
Poetical. The end of the verse is marked as in Prose by Silluq

is that next the beginning, marked by a sign called Merkha

4. Maqqeph (binder). Part of the accentual or rhyth-
mical machinery is the Maqqeph or hyphen, which binds
two or more words together. The sign indicates that all
the words so joined are pronounced in the rhythmical
reading as one word. The occurrence of two accented syl-
lables in immediate succession is contrary to the rhythm,
and this conjunction is avoided by throwing several words

accents (viz. Silluq — , marking the end, and ^Athnah —
marking the middle of the verse), and the three greatest
of the Poetical, throw vowels into pause. The effects are
mostly as follows:

a) A short vowel in the tone becomes long, as wb^
pause D'lb; and if the short vowel had been modified from
another it is the long of the primary sound that appears,

§ 10. THE ACCENTS. METHEG &c. PAUSE.

b) Occasionally the tone is shifted from the last syllable
to the penult, which is lengthened if it was short, nnj;

p. nnjr.

c) Perhaps the commonest pausal effect is what looks
like a combination of a b.
In verbal forms with vocal
shVa before the tone, this shVa becomes the tone long of
the primary sound whose place it had taken, and the tone
is then shifted to it, as niDti^ she dwelt p. n^bu, from rzv^:
nny sta?ul ye, p. ni5j? from nby. A few nominal forms
follow the same method (see § 45).

Eem. Sh'^va before the suffix kha becomes e, ^JDID p. IPID. In
some cases the weight of the Pause doubles the consonant, ^v^n
Judg. 5. 7 ; there is also a fondness shewn in many cases for the
sharp d in pausal syllables.

6. Q'ri and KHhihh (read, written). The K'thibh is the
consonantal text as it lay before the punctuators, being
held inviolable. When however for any reason, whether of
grammar or propriety, the punctuators preferred another
reading, the vowels of this reading were put under the
K^thibh in the text, while the consonants, which could not
find a place in the text, were set in the margin.
This re-
commended reading is the Q^ri. Attention is called to the
Margin by a small circle placed over the K^th'ibh^ thus:
ns?in Gen. 24. 14,— which means that for the (w«s.) form
ngan of the text the form vr^iy\ {fern.) is to be read.

OF WORDS AND FORMS.

Roots may be considered to be of three classes : firsts
the simplest and instinctive interjection^ expressive of mere
feeling, as ah! second., the higher demonstrative, expressing
locality, direction, and distinction between one object and
another; and third, roots embodying thoughts, noiitis and
verbs. The first class, being uninflected and individual, do
not need any separate treatment. And of the others it is
better to begin with the second, which is next in simplicity.

languages, e. g. bo?/, hoys, by the outside inflection ; man, men, by
the inside ; so fear, feared, but tread, trod. The Shemitic languages

have a preference for the inner inflection.

At the same time as the accentual changes
take place to a certain extent on various principles, they afford

changes may be called Inflection.

3. Inflection, external modifications in Nouns.
In Hebrew there are trvo genders: mas. and fem.
There are ^^ree numbers: sing.^ dual, and plur. The dual
is now very much in disuse, being employed mostly to ex-
press things that occur naturally or by use in pairs, as

hands, feet, shoes.

§ 16. THE NOUN. INFLECTION.

The fern. sing, is formed by adding ah to the mas.
The plur. mas. is formed by adding im to the sing. : and
the plur. fern, by changing ah into 6th, or by adding 6th to
the 5m^. if it has no fern, termination.

The dual is formed by adding dyim to the mas. sing, for
the mas., and to the original fem. sing, (see Rem. h) for
the fem. Thus:

Rem. b. The original fem. ending is ath {T\-^r)- When the

nor readily if in one cons, preceded by an unchangeably long
vowel. In these cases the termination ah was added. Thus the

§ 17. CASES. THE CONSTRUCT STATE.

probably from neighbouring tribea, there appears the termination
u. (The nom. in Arabic ends in u or un.)

Second, the Genitive.

This is a relation of two elements,

is always a noun, while the second, though
of which the first
chiefly a noun, may be a pronoun cr even a clause.
The first
member of the gen. relation is said to be in the construct state.
It is a question whether this first member had any distinctive
termination. It appears occasionally in i} The second member has
no special termination. (The Ar. gen., which is the second member,

is in i or in.)

Third, the Accusative.

Neither is this case expressed ordi-
narily by any specific termination. But there are here quite visible
traces of a case ending, though it is not easy to say whether the
traces should be considered remains of a full development now in
decay, or merely a rudimentary commencement. This accus. ending

is a. (The Arab. ace. is in a or an.)

Thus so far as case endings can be suspected they are the
three sounds a i u. Three cases may seem to form a meagre pro-
vision for expressing the relations of nouns. But the use of the

Accus. is very wide, it serves often as a locative, and sometimes

almost as an instrumental, and as a general modal or adverbial case.
And the use of the Gen. is also extremely free.

2. The construct state. When a noun is so connected in
thought with a following word or clause that the two make
up one idea, the first is said to be in the construct state or
in construction. A word not so dependent is said to be in
the absolute state; e. g. in son of the king, great in power,
the words "son" and "great" are in the construct, "king"
and "power" are in the absolute.

The const, relation corresponds most nearly to the Gen.,
or to the relations expressed by of in English. Now the
first half of a relation like son of— , forming no complete
idea of itself, the emphasis of the whole expression lies on

§ 18. THE FIEST DECLENSION.*

Nouns may be arranged in Declensions according to
the internal vowel changes produced by alteration in the
Many
place of Tone occasioned by Inflexion (§ 16. 2).
forms of Nouns, however, contain unchangeable vowels,
i. e. vowels pure long, or diphthongal, or unchangeable
from position, as "itas {gihhdr), a hero, ]"|^n« (ehh-ijdn\ pooi\
in both of which the first vowel is unchangeable by po-
sition, and the second pure long, and consequently un-
changeable by nature (§ 6. 1). Such Nouns, as they suffer
no internal change from inflexion, do not seem to require
classification; they are indeclinable.^

The forms that suffer change are those having tone-long
These vowels, having been rarely expressed by
vowels.
the so-called Vowel-letters (§ 2. 3), may very generally be
distinguished from pure-long, and diphthongal, vowels,
which were very often so expressed (§ 2. 3 Rem.).
In
general only qamec and cere are tone-long in nouns, holefn
being for the most part unchangeably long.

The forms with changeable vowels seem capable of being

generalized under three classes or Declensions.

* The principles stated in § 6 should be fully understood here; and it
should be remembered that, when words are increased at the end, the
accent plants itself upon the significant inflectional addition (§ 5. 1).

^ Such forms are those numbered 8, 14, 15, 16, 20, 23 in the Table of
Common Nominal Forms in the Appendix of Paradigms, and a number of
other Forms not given in that Table. These forms with unchangeable
vowels might be called a First Declension, in which case the Declensions
would amount in all to four.

46

§ 18. THE FIBST DECLENSION.

1. A large number of words are of the same form as the
perfect of verbs, and are chiefly participles or adjectives,
though many are substantives. With these may be classed
some other forms of words that are subject to the same
laws. Together they may be called

THE FIRST DECLENSION.

They are words having:

a in the pretone, or a in the tone, or a in both places.

Rules for declension.

1. With inflectional additions the
accent is shifted a place, and the tone-long pretonic « e is
lost, i. e. becomes vocal sh^va, by § 6. 2 c.

2. The very hurried utterance of the construct produces,
in addition to this loss of the pretonic vowel, a contraction
of the tone-vowel a e, that is the shortening of it in a shut
syllable {sing.), and the loss of it in an open one (plur.)

Plur,

Cons. sing.

Rem. a.

Tone-long o does not appear much in nouns, but

see § 29. The forms 1, 2, 3 with vowels a—a, a— e, a—o, may
be considered the typical forms of this declension, see § 22.
The forms 4, 5 are pass, participles, and 6 is a less common
nominal formation. The forms 7, 8 shew that if the pretonic be
immutable there is no change except in Cons., rule 1 having no
application. A very few forms without a are similarly inflected.
See Add. Notes.

Rem. b. The form a— e, has a in cons, sing., as no other
short vowel can stand in the final accented shut (§ 6. Rem. b).

§ 19. THE PEONOMINAL SUFFIXES.

The separate Personal Pronouns are used only to ex-

press the Nominative or as Subject (§ 12).

Hebrew has not largely developed the adjective; instead
of saying holy hill, silver idol, it says hill of holiness, idol
of silver, and the like. Similarly for mij horse it says horse,
of me. The possessive pronouns my, thy, his, our &c. are
altogether wanting. But the noun being placed before the
pronoun in the Genitive, two effects followed:

first, the pronouns had not the strength of nouns and could
not maintain themselves as separate words, and so became
attracted in the form oi Suffixes to the noun preceding them
and seco?id, the noun itself, which before an independent
word would have stood in the form of the Const., underwent
before these lighter fragments attached to itself a less
degree of shortening, only a few of the more heavily ac-
cented Suffixes having the power to throw it into the
Const, form.

Thus the Suffixes are divided into light and heavy; all

§ 19. THE PRONOMINAL SUFFIXES.

49

are light, except those to a singular noun which express
your mas. and fern., and those to a plur. noun which ex-
press your and their mas. and fern.

The light suffixes affect a noun like the Plur. or Du. termi-

nation, the heavy throw it into the form of the Const, state.

Particles, such as Prepositions and Adverbs, are generally
Nouns in a fragmentary condition, and may take Suffixes,
which are attached to them precisely as to Nouns. See § 49.

59

§ 19. THE PRONOMINAL SUFFIXES.

Rem. a. The suffixes of 2. j^ers. ha, h, kem, hen, are for ta, t, tern,
ten, according to an interchange of f and k frequent in language
(§ 12). No Dag. in h by Note p. 17.

In the other persons the fragmentary element of the pronoun may

readily be seen.

Rem. b. The helping vowel between the stem and the suffix seems
in all cases traceable to i or a. Comp. § 17. 1.
In the 1st and 2nd
person the i sound prevailed as base, sns^, susehJia, susekh, susemt.
Forms with a are rare. Job 22. 20.

junctive), and future perf. The imperfect includes all im-
perfect tenses e. g. present (especially of general truths),
the classical imperfect, and the future. The first form is
often called the preterite.^ and the second the future., but
these designations are proper to Tenses and are too limited.

3. Moods. Both the perfect and imperfect may be indi-
cative'., the subjective moods (subjunctive,
optative &c.)
are generally expressed by the imperfect and its modifi-

cations (§ 23).

Besides, there is an imperative which is also derived from
the imperf. And there are two forms of infinitive, called
absolute and constrvct, the latter being a gerund.

4. Degrees of the stem idea. The stem idea or meaning
of the verb is presented in three conditions or degrees:

the Simple, as to eat; the Intensive, as to eat ?nuch, often,
greedily; and the extensive or Causative, extending the
action over a second agent, as to make to eat, to give one

to cat.

Each of these three conditions of the stem idea appears
in three voices, Active, Passive, and middle or Reflexive,
though some parts are now lost. Thus:

Simple.

Conjugations. What are called in other languages
conjugations, do not exist. The various classes of irregular
or weak verbs most nearly correspond to conjugations.
The above seven parts are all growths of the original
simple stem, which undergoes some modification, conso-
nantal or vocalic, to produce them.

6. Inflection.

Inflection to express person takes place
by the connexion of the significant parts of the personal
pronoun with the stem (§ 12 and 15, 2); and the third sing,
as simplest is taken first, then the second, and finally the
first. In an action which is finished rather the action itself
than the actor is prominent: hence in the perfect the stem
is put before the persona] designations.
In the imperfect,
or action going on, the actor is more prominent, and the
personal modification is prefixed.

The terminations te7n, ten are heavy, and, removing the

Rem. a. The abstract noun which appears as infin. cons., may be
considered to lie at the root of the impf. and the imper. The pre-
fixes and affixes are fragments of the personal pronouns, though
rather more obscured than in the perfect.

according to these vowels a, e and o verbs.
Verbs ending
in a are transitive, verbs in e and o are intransitive, though
these terms in Hebrew do not quite correspond to the same
terms in the Western languages. The class of intransitive
verbs is very wide, embracing words that describe the

condition of the subject (as to he full,
to thirst, to fear, to
love), even though capable of taking an object after them.
The term Sfative verbs, i. e. verbs of state, is used by some
grammarians.

the Impf. in o, b^'p^, "rbpl; the Perf. not in d (Stative verb)

Rem. a. The class of Stative verbs is very numerous. It consists
of words which express a) a bodily or physical state, as to be great,
little, smooth, deep, short, old, and the like; t)) an affection of the
mind or act of the senses (except sight), as to mourn, rejoice, hate,
hear &c. ; c) actions intransitive, or actions in which the reflex in-
fluence of the action upon the subject is very prominent, as to die,
approach, ivear (clothes), heio wood &c.

Rem. h. Forms with e express a temporary state, those with o a
state permanent, but this distinction is not now observed in verbs,
though it is still quite prevalent in the participial adjectives derived
Verbs in o do not now number over half a score, but
from them.
Only a very few, however, have e

invariably, this vowel being usually sharpened, except when in pause
or in the open pretonic syllable, into d.

Rem. c. The o verbs retain the o throughout the perfect; in 2nd

plur.

becomes o by loss of the accent.

See Parad.

Rem. d. The rule given regarding the agreement of Inf. Cons,
with the Impf. is true in theory, but in point of fact the Inf. Cons,
even in Stative verbs is generally in d; the number of forms in a is
now very small in the Strong verb, e. g. ^Dtl' to lie, usually, Gen.
39. 10, 14, and others occasionally, Eccl. 13. 4, cf. Prov. 10. 21 ; SI. 4,

1 It is interesting to observe that the vowel a is characteristic of the
Active, e (rarely o) of the Stative, and ti (or o) of the Passive,—that is,

the three Classes of vowels correspond generally to Active, Stative( Neuter)
and Passive. In the Perf. Qal the place of the characteristic vowel is in
the second syll., in most of the other parts it is in the fiiSt throughout.
In the Active verb the type of the Impf. was perhaps yaqtol (yaqtul),
and in the Stative, yiqtal] bat owing to the prevalent thinning of a to i
in the language (§ 2. 1. 1), the syll. yaq was pronounced (and of course
spelled) yiq. In favourable conditions, however, the a still remains, as in
Verbs \st Grift., ^Ayin Vav, and 'Ayin Doubled. The last class is particularly
instructive (§ 42).

The original form of the Act. Part, was perhaps ^^'p^, like the Perf.,
and many of the adjj. of this form may be Participles. The Part, qotel
is a newer formation and has not j-et made its way into all verbs.

§ 23. THE MOODS. VAV CONVEESIVE.

1. Besides the ordinary imperfect, which expresses the
action simply, there are certain modifications of it which
indicate the relation of the action to the speaker's will or
feelings. The speaker may throw his own feeling into the
word in two ways, either by a sharp, hasty utterance of it,
thus expressing peremptory wish; or on the contrary by a
lengthening out of the word, giving expression to the
di?'ection of the mind or action. The short form that arises
in the first way is called the Jussive', the other or lengthened
form has been named the Cohortative.^

1) The Jussive. The Jussive arises through a contraction
of the last syll. of the impf. ; but as in the regular verb

^ Both the Jussive and Cohortative are comprehended by Ewald
under the name Voluntative ; for Cohortative Bottcher prefers to use the
term Intentional.

—

§ 23. THE MOODS. VAV CONVKRSIVE.

Gl

this can take place only in Hiphil (§ 27), the Jussive in all
other parts coincides with the ordinary impf. ; and in all
forms with inflectional terminations the juss. and ordinary

3d persons.

The Jussive (as the name implies) expresses a command,
less strongly, an entreaty, re-
may he kill; or, with a negative, a dissuasion,

iet him kill;

or,

quest &c.

us y^p"'.

as !i^ppp\"b« do not (ye) kill.

2) The Cohortative. The Cohortative is formed by adding
The Cohort, is found (with

the syllable ah to the impf.

rare exceptions) in 1st person only.

The Cohort, expresses a desire or intention, as ^'?ttp^?

let me kill, I will kill.

2. The Emphatic Imperative. The same termination ah
is added to the imper. 2. m. s. to give it emphasis, as rh'^'p
Oh kill!

Eem. a. The sharp pronunciation of the impf. (by Avhich the
Jussive arose) vas probably accompanied by a retraction of the Tone
to the penult, with the effect of leaving a short vo-\\ el in the last syll.
As the Tone, however, could be retracted only under peculiar con-
ditions, e. g. when the penult was open (§ 5 Rem. o), the accent
usually fell on the last, the vowel of which it made tone-long (§ 6. 2 h).
The only formal effect, therefore, of the Jussive (except in verbs H 7
§ 45) was to change the vowels i and v, in 2nd and 3rd sing. impf.
into e and o.

Rem, h. The Emph. Imper. has tAvo forms H/^p and H^^p (qotldh,
qitldh, half open, § 21, Rem. b). The Emph. Imper. appears chiefly
in the Irregular Verb (§ 32).

3. r«y Cofiversive. The conjunction ) and is sometimes
used not as a mere copulative to join or coordinate clauses,
but with a certain subordinating power, so as to indicate
that what is now added is the result or sequence of the
preceding; as, he spake and (and so, and thus, then) it
was done.

The usage is this:

After a simple perfect events conceived as following upon
this perf. are expressed by the emphatic vav joined with

62

§ 23. THE MOODS. VAV CONVERSIVE.

the imperfect^ and conversely, after a simple imperfect the
events conceived as following on it are expressed by vav
with the perfect.

As in this usage the vav seemed to convert the impf.
into the meaning of the perf. and vice versa^ it was named
vav conversive. By modern Grammarians it is commonly
named vav consecutive.

Pointing of Vav with Imperfect,

a) When joined to the
Impf. this strong vav is pointed exactly like the Article
(§ 11), as 'pbp*! and he killed^ V^pKI and I killed.

b) The Tone is usually retracted from the last syll. to
the penult., when this syll. is open (Rem. a above), as "i)2t;»i
and he said.

Pointing of Vav with Perfect, a) When joined to the Perf.
strong vav has the pointing of vav Copulative (§ 15), as
b^'\>\ ^^id he will kill; UP\h^^) and ye mill kill.

b) The Tone is usually thrown forward from the penult

to the last syll.., as tb'^'^y and thou shall kill.

On usage of vav conv. see particularly the note p. 63.

Rem. a. As the form with vav expresses the s^Deaker's feelivg of
the connexion of Avhat he now states A\ith the preceding, it is natural
to suppose that the forms of the Voluntative (Juss. and Cohort.) are

those lying at the basis of the Consecutive Tenses.^

Eem. h. The drawing backward of the Tone in Vav consec. impf.
very well suggests its connexion with what precedes, and the throwing
of it forward in Vav consec. perf. suggests its connexion with what

follows.

Tlie projection of the Tone is regular in 1st and 2nd sing, of Perf.,
but does not appear in 1st p/., and is not found anywhere in pause.
It is also avoided when it would occasion the concurrence of two
accented syllables, Deut. 14. 26, Am. 1. 4, 7. In weak verbs the rule
of projection is subject to modifications.

characteristics of several of the parts, such as the inten-
sive, are obscured; hence the word ^^j? (though poetical
and defective), is generally used in modern grammars.^

to express intensity the middle radical of the verb is
doubled. "Extensive" or causative means what is increased

§ 25. THE SIMPLE EEPLEXIVE OR NIPB'AL.

The Niph'al is formed by prefixing to the stem the
syllable hin having reflexive force.
This syllable is con-
tracted to 71 in the pcrf. and pm^t. and one form of the
infin., but appears entire in the impf. and parts connected.

^ The learner must not use 7^f? in Prose composition for "kill". The

word is rare in Heb. and in use only in Poetry.

In meaning tlie Niph'al is properly the reflexive of the

§ 26. THE INTENSIVE ACT., PASS. AND REFLEX.,
PfEL &c.

The Intensive is naturally formed by doubling, both in

verbs and nouns, the middle stem-letter.

1. The Pi'el. Pi'el is properly intensive of Qal, that is,
it adds such ideas as often, much, for a Jong time &c. to the
simple idea of the verb, as "intt^ to break, "12^ to break in
pieces; or it implies that the action of the verb is done
by many or to many. Sometimes when the Qal is intransi-
tive the Pi'el becomes causative, as no'? to learn, ia"? to teach

2.

Pu'al.

Pu'al is the proper passive of Pi'el

in its

various senses.

3.

Hithpa'el. The Hithpa'el is formed by prefixing the
syllable hith, having reflexive force, to the root-form of
the Pi'el, as b^p^, b^pnri.

When the syllable hith precedes the sibilants D, V}, ly
the n changes places with the sibilant,
as "isriK^n for
"IJSB^nn ; with ij the n further becomes to, as pimn from p^s.
With unsibilant dentals the n is assimilated, as ITl^T}

for 'tann.

5*

68

§ 26. THE INTENSIVE, PIE'L &c.

In meaning Hith. is properly reflexive of Pi'el, as ti^ij?
^'%>J)T\ to sanctify oneself; but it very often
to sanctify^
implies that one shews himself as, or gives himself out as
performing the action of the simple verb.

Eem. a. The i in first cyll. of Pi' el is a thinned a, cf. Gen. 41. 51;
a appears in parts after the perf. The final e appears as fixed sound
onlj' in imperf. and connected parts ; the perf. has often a, probably
the real vowel of the form, Q^^ Jud. 1. 7.
In a very few verbs e
ifyhol) appears in perf., "12'^ to speak, D^? wash, "123 atone.

The infin. abs. is generally of lorm pa' el like cons. Ex. 21. 36, Jer.
12. 17, but cf. Ps. 118. 18. In some cases first syll. i-etains the i, Lev.

In Fu.
In part. Pu. initial m in a few casfjs falls away, Ex. 3. 2, 2 K. 2. 10
(Ez. 26. 17 is perf.).

Eem. b. The syllable hith is a stronger reflexive prefix than hin,
and the Hithpa'el less commonly has the passive sense. It has even
a pass, of its own in a few cases.
Naturally it has reflexive sense,
Gen. 4?. 1.

As in Pi'el the final vowel may be a, Deut. 1. 37; 9. 8.
Eem. c. Other forms of intensive. Though the intens. is most na-
turally formed by doubling the middle consonant, it may be formed
in other ways analogous:

1) By doubling the last stem-letter, pi lei (jnlal), pulal, qitlal,
qntlal, as ]3&?a^ to he quiet, Jer. 48. 11, Job 3. 18; pass, hhtl^^ 1 Sam.
2. 5, Is. 19. 8, Hos. 4. 3 (Ez, 28. 23, Ps. 88. 17 may be textual errors).
2) By doubling the last two letters, p^'aVal, qHaltal, as "irj*lDP

to pal^ntate, pass, "^!5"l!2^ to be much inflamed. Ps. 45. 3, § 44.

3) In some stems as 'A^/in Vav and Double 'Ai/in §§ 40. 42 doubling
the last two letters is equivalent to doubling' the whole word (with
omission of the weak letter), x>ilvel: as ^IJ^ fly, ')J^SV flutter, 73 roll,
7372 whirl, 7373 sustain, pass. 7372 (kolkal) from 7^3, comp. click-
clack, dingdong.

4) By adding a letter to a stem or by inserting a letter, so that
qnadriliteral verbs arise, most of which follow the Pi'el in the method
of inflection, e. g. T^l? to spread, Job 26. 9, DDI? to consume. Pass.
la'DK)"! Job 33. 2.5. Ex. 16. 14. Others in Uph. Gen. 13. 9. Is. 30. 21.

§ 27. THE CAUSATIVE, HIPH'IL, HOPH'AL.

§ 27. THE CAUSATIVE, HIPH'IL, HOPH'AL.

1. Hipliil. The causative is formed by prefixing the letter
h with i (properly a thinned a) to the stem, and expanding
the final vowel to i, ^""ppn.

Rule for inflection. The final i is maintained in open
syllables, i. e. with vocalic affixes {a i u) and has the ac-
cent; in shut syll. it becomes a in perf., and generally e
after the perf.

In meaning Hiph. is causative of Qal, as ij^s to oversee,

Tj?Bn to make one oversee, to entrust to.

2.

Hoph'al. The Hoph. is passive of the Hiph. in its

various senses.

Bern. a. The i of first syll. appeal's only in perf., the real a else-
where. The t of final syll. is merely an extension of e, which itself
has arisen out of a. In inf. i sometimes remains in first syll., Deut.

§ 29. SECOND DECLENSION.

The words are monosyllables with a short vowel of one
or other of the three classes after the first radical. Under
the tone the vowels i o became e o, § 6. 2; and a few words
have remained in this condition, as «^a valleij, 'i"ii nard,
pB^p truth. But there was, as in other languages,^ a natural
tendency to separate two final consonants by a furtive
vowel, and a slight e (s'^ghol) slid in after the second letter.
The words thus became dissyllabic, though the tone-
syllable remained the same, now the penult.
The furtive
e by a species of attraction depressed the primary a of first
class also to e. The dilated form of the words thus appears
only when the third letter is iinal.

A smaller number of words had the short vowel after the second
radical as qtal, qtil, qtol, under the tone qtal qtel qtol, 7Qp 7tP(P 7bp.
These forms are chiefly retained by verbs and eater into the imperf.
and related parts.

From the furtive s°ghol the words are often called
segholates, and according to the class of their primary
short vowel a i o, segholates of first, second or third

class.

From the presence of weak letters the s^ghols may be
obscured, but the invariable sign of this class of word is the
accent on the penult.

Rules for declension.

1) The cons, state is, of course,

like the absolute.

2) With all inflectional additions except the plural,
the word appears in its primary monosyllabic form, qatl,

qitl, qotl.

3) The plural both mas. and fem. assumes the form of
a word of first declension, with pretonic a, q^/dlim, q^tdloth,
as if from the form qtal. When the pretonic a becomes
lost, the primary vowel is resumed, qatle. qitle &c.

^ Comp. alarm and alarum; Gaelic tarbh = tarabh, Dutch Delft=De-

left &o.

and with suffixes, and sometimes also in the abs.; and some words
seem to use only the §egholate form.

3. In general the

plurals are formed regularly from the

ordinary fem. or from what would be the ordinary fem. if it

were found.

Consequently the original mas. must be carefully

attended to.

Rem. a. By § 22. Note segholates of 1st class, having the a sound,
are from transitive verbs, and those with i o from intrans. verbs.
This law does not apply to the infinitives which end like their im-
perfects, in which the characteristic vowel stood in connexion with

nouns and in all infin. of form qtal the a has been thinned to ^, and
the inflected forms coincide with those of 2nd class. Some words
have both vowels. See Add. Notes to 2nd Declens.

Rem. b. For i the alternative e sometimes appears; and also u

for 0.

Rem. e. Compare the cons. du. with cons. plur. ; the latter has half
open syll. § 6. 2 e. The du., however, sometimes has pvetonic a like
the plur.

Rem. d. The word n''hosheth shews that the termination t shifts
the accent just like ah (ath), of which it is therefore probably a con-

traction.

§ 30. THIRD DECLENSION.

1. Besides the words resembling the perfect which form
the chief elements of the first declension and the nouns
having affinity with the imperfect and infinitive forming
the second, there is another formation which along with
the words that follow it may be called a ihir-d declension.
This is the act. participle Qal, qotel, probably a later deve-
lopment and not found in all verbs.

Thit^d declension. The type of this declension is the act.
part. Qal; and the declension comprises all words, whether
participles or nouns, ending in e (^ere) with a vowel un-
changeable (by nature or position) in the place of the pre-

tone.

Rules for inflection.

1) In words of this class the verbal
law of inflection is followed, that is, with vocalic additions
the vowel in the tone, the ^, is lost.

2) With consonantal additions the e being thrown into
an unaccented shut (half open) syllable, becomes the short
vowel, i. e. e or i; i particularly with labials.

the simple verb with some circumlocution for self, must
be used.

The following principles will be found sufficient:

1. Before the suffixes verbal forms altered or rubbed
off are restored; 3 fem. s. ah becomes ath (§ 16 Rem. &);
t becomes ti, and 2 mas. pi. iem becomes turn,
2 fem. s.
(§ 12 Rem. &), though the weak m disappears.

2. Verbal forms ending in a vowel append the suffixes
in their shortest consonantal form {ni, ka, A-, v, hu^ ha, 7ut,
kem, ken, m, w § 12) immediately to the vowel termination.

3. In forms having no apparent vowel termination a help-

ing vowel is used:

1) The suff. ka kem ken^ as in nouns, have reduced the

helping vowel to a mere sh^va, § 19.

2) All the other suff. have a full vowel. Now the verb
had originally three vowels both in the perf. and imperf.
In the perf. the final vowel was «, and hence with suff. to
the perf. the helping vowel sound is a.

3) In the imperf. some more indefinite sound ended the
form {e or u perhaps) and this appears as e with suff. to
the imperf.

The imperat. follows the imperf.
4) The inf. co?is. takes the suffixes of the noun.

4. Effect of suff. on preceding vowels.

1) The perf. Qal
of all forms, and imperf. and imper. Qal in «, follow words
of the first declension, preserving the tonic and losing the
pretonic vowel when it is changeable, § 18.
In open pre-
tonic syllables a becomes « § G. 2.

2) The infin. cons, and imper. Qal follow the second de-
clension, the form q^tol being a segholate of third class.
(The imper. of the form b^J) follows the first declens.
See
above 4. 1.)

3) All other parts of the verb (ending in e or o) follow
the verbal law, that is, with vocalic additions lose the tonic
vowel, and may be said to follow the third declens. § 30.

5. In the imperf. between the accented helping vowel
and the suffixes 7ii mi of 1st pers., hu ha of 3 pers. s., and

ka of the pausal eka of 2 mas. s., the letter n, having de-
monstrative force, is often inserted, and this by its union
with the conson. of the suff. gives rise to forms enni (anni)
ennu, ennu ennah, ekka (for enhu, enha, enkd). Occasionally
forms appear in which the union of the n with the follow-
ing letter has not yet taken place.

Rem. a. On Perf. See remarks on nominal suffixes, § 19. In 3 fern,
sing, the termination ath retains the tone except with heavy suf-
fixes. The suff. of 2 fern. s. is oftener ekh; comp. Jud. 4. 20, 1 Sam.

3 2^1' f^*n. assume with suff. the form of 2 pi. m., Jer. 2. 19.

2. 5.

Rem. c. The infin. cons, uses the verbal suff. of 1 p. s. to denote
the object, me; but in the other persons the nominal suff. alone are
used to express both object and subject {him and his).

The suff. to the participle are also those of the norm, though in
the singular of partt. verbal suff. are also used in poetry, Gen. 4.

14, 15, Ps. 18. 33.

The infin. cons, with stffi'ces ka kem ken occasionally appears of

It may be repeated (foot note p. 17), that with sufl". the first syll.
of infin. cons, is half open; and that on the contrary tlie prep. 7 unites
with it so closely as generally to form a shut syllable. The imper.
is also half-open.

older Grammarians. Now the first letter of this verb being
Pe, the first letter of any verb was called its Pe; and in
like manner the second letter was called its ^Ayin, and the

A weak verb is a verb which has oue or more of its three

The weak letters are the Gut-
turals^ the Quiesce?its and Aim, i. e. the letters N n n y "i

§ 33. PE NUN VERBS.

The letter n in Hebrew shews the same kind of feeble-
ness that it has in other languages, when it is not sustained
by being followed by a full vowel its sound is apt to be
lost in that of the consonant after it, in-licio = illicio; yin-
gash == yiggash.

1. When n stands at the end of a syllable (imperf. Qal,
perf. and part. Niph., Hiph., Hoph.) it is assimilated to
the next consonant, which is doubled, Vsi";='?S';, '?''Sin=^^Bn
{yin-pol= yippol, hmpil=hippil).

2. When n not having a full vowel of its own begins a
word (imper., inf. cons. Qal) it often falls away altogether,
as ti*: for a^ii (gash for ti'gasfi).

3. When n falls away in infin. cons, this form assumes
the fem. termination ^, becoming a segholate noun having
i when inflected (§ 29. Rem. a), as nii'a. ^nir^3.

§ 34. PE GUTTURAL VERBS.

See the rules for Gutturals § 8.
1. By 2nd rule of Gutt, a gutt. requires a hateph for

simple shVa vocal (2 pi. perf., imper., infin. cons., Qal).

2. By 1st rule Rem. «, i before gutt. becomes e, and by
2nd rule the short vowel repeats itself under the gutt. in
a hateph corresponding to itself. Thus:

Rem. a. In Active verbs (impf. in o) the primary a appears with

Numb. 3. 6, Jer. 15. 14.

Rem. b. The harder gutturals, while they always depress the
vowel {i, u to e, 0), often keep simple sh*va at the end of the syllable,
as DSn^ he will be wise. Exceptionally a appears in 7iiph., Gen. 31. 27.

1.

1) By 1st rule of Gutt. the gutt, prefers the a sound,
hence impf. and imper. Qal, and very often perf. Pi'el, end
in a', and even other j)arts may have a for e; as ^r\^\

2) By 2nd rule the gutt. must have a hateph as indistinct
vowel, hence with the terminations a i u the middle gutt.
is pointed with h. pathah^ as nttnil^.

3) By 4th rule the gutt. cannot be doubled, hence Pi'el,
Pu'al, Hithp. must omit dag. from the middle radical. The
preceding vowel becomes tone-long always before Resh., as
';)"|5 for ':j'?i3,— and generally before Uleph; with the rest
it usually remains (and i u are not depressed io e o before
the virtually doubled gutt.), as tona^, tanti^.

Rem, a. The form of imper. Qal in z m is by 3rd rule of Gntt.

1. The peculiarities of Lam. Gutt. arise chiefly from the
first law of gutturals,— that all final gutturals must have
an a sound before them.

1) Long vowels take path, furtive between them and the

gutt., and the short vowel must be a (path.), as rxh^^

2) The long vowels e and o in certain cases may become

As to e the practice is:

In parts naturally short, — imper., jussive, infin. cons.,
it becomes «, and generally also in other parts in con-
tinuous discourse, as n^^, Th2i\

In pause e is resumed.

§ 39. PE YOD AND PE VAV VERBS.

The letters w and y have become a good deal confused
in Hebrew, and in consequence of this confusion, roots
having 7V as their first, second, or third stem-letter, have
not remained distinct from those having y in the same
places.

Though the two classes V'3 and i"2 are a good deal mixed
up with one another, it is conducive to clearness to treat
them separately.

1. Pe Vav verbs.

1) When the first radical is initial it
always appears as y, viz. in Qal (except impf. and related
parts), Pi'el, Pu'al, and usually Hithpa'el.

All these parts may be said to use forms from v-^; and
the perf. Qal having y, verbs of both classes have the
general name of "'"D verbs.

2) When the first radical is not initial, and particularly
when it is at the end of a syllable, it appears as w, viz. in
Niph'al, Hoph'al, and usually Hiphll,

The to unites in these parts with the vowel of the preformative,
a or u, and there arises in Niph. and Hiph. the sound aiv=o; and
in Hoph. mv = ii, as n'"ti^'ir[ = 3"'ti''in (hmv-shib = hd-sMb), ^B^U^-'li
(naiv-shab =nd-shab), 3^in=D^!in (}mto-sIiab = hu-shab).
These parts employ forms of V'D verbs.
3) The confusion is greatest in the impf. Qal and related
parts (infiu. and imper.). These parts are formed after two
methods:

a) In some verbs the initial letter falls out of the impf.
In this case the vowel of the
and related parts entirely.
preformative letter of impf. is e, and the final vowel is also
e (or a beside gutturals); and the infin. cons, strengthens
itself by assuming the fem. t, as 2\^l. n^il^ {yi'shch, shcbeth).
b) In other verbs the impf. and related parts are formed
quite regularly, with y as first radical, which is retained
in all the parts, and merely quiesces after the preformative
The niph.,
i of impf. The final vowel is a. Thus ^y'\ &c.
hiph. &c. are formed as in class a).

The paradigm shews that the impf. may be formed after
this method, while the imper. and infiu. may follow 3 a).

—

96

§ 39. PE YOD AND PE VAV VEEBS.

2. Pe Yod verbs. A certain number of verbs have these

peculiarities:

1) In Hiph'il ij shews itself: the y then unites (just as
TV does) with the vowel a of the preformative, a{/=e, as

psyn=p"'i\n to give suck.

The Niph. and HopU. are wanting.
2) The impf. Qal is formed after 1. 3b) (and examples
of imper. and infin. cons, do not occur), as pii"; he will suck.

These seem examples of real v'g verbs.
3. Verbs assimilating the first radical. The initial w y
are subject to still another mode of treatment; instead of
coalescing with a preceding vowel (as iy=i-, urv=u, ay=e.,
aw=d), they may be assimilated, like ;«, to the following
consonant, which is then doubled, as pr to pour, impf. pji\
4. Nouns from verbs Pe Yod. The infin. cons, is inflected
with ^, §§29,31, ^riSB^ my sitting. The infin. is occasionally
of the form n3B^, and this form has been adopted by the
nouns, as {T\yr\_ to know) rrij; assembly, 7\^yi_ counsel, 7\)'^ sleep.
These words, however, inflect after the manner of the first
declension, § 18.

The nouns with m preformative, § 30, are of the form
n'?1D fem. rrpyo (§ 29. 2) from V's; n^^O from v-ej (i. e. mam
=m6, may=me^ as in Hiph.), and j;^)5 when the initial letter
is assimilated.

Bern. a.

In Hithp. the syllable Mth is so distinct from the root
that it is scarcely felt to form part of the word. A few forms appear
with 10 as yninn from yi"* to knoio.

The Hoph. occasionally has 8 for u, as yilH, Lev. 4. 23.

Rem. h.

Verbs forming the impf. and related parts b}' rejection
of the first radical do not constitute a numerous class, but are words
of very common occurrence. Those most frequently met with are:
J?*IJ to know, \T to bear, i<^^ to go out, T^ to go doivn, 2^^^ to sit;
and ^vH to go, which derives the parts in question from ^T, itself
not found.

have arisen from e by thinning.

Eem. c. The form 3b) is the one proper to stative verbs; and
most verbs of the class are stative, though there are a few actives.
Examples are: ^2^ to be dry, ']J^J to lie weary, ^^"l^ to fear, ^1^'' to

Examples of infin. and imper. retaining the initial y are rather
rare, and are chiefly from verbs doubly weak, as the verbs to fear,
These parts rather follow the forms of 3 a), as ^y^ to
to throw.

possess.

The rare infin. cons. r\75\ to be able, TWi^T to dry, Gen. 8. 7, is

met with in these verbs.

Rem. d. Proper ''"D verbs are: pi^ to suck, 7T (Hiph.) to howl,
rta"" (impf. and Hiph.) to be good, ]'Q'' (Hiph.) to go to the right, yp''

Kem. e. Verbs assimilating the fii'st radical are: 315'' (Hiph.) to
They mostly have a

place, y^J'' (Hiph.) to spread, IT^I to burn, &c.
sibilant as second radical.

The general remark may be made that the various classes of ^"S
verbs have become considerably confused, and in the impff. and re-
lated parts, and the Hiph. &c., shew a great tendency to borrow
forms from one another. The individual facts must be learned hy

§ 40. 'AYIN VAV AND YOD VERBS.

The principles stated in § 9 should be well understood here.
By § 9. 3, such forms as perf and part, qawctm, maweth, tawoh,
§ 22, become qdm, meth, tab; so part, qawuvi—qum, and infin. qaicom
=qdm.

Again, by § 9. 2, forms like infin. q^wum — qum; impf. yaqwuni =

yd-qum; Hiph. hiqivim=he-qim, Hoph. huqwam=hu-qam.

These general laws explain the following facts: —
1. As in Pe Vav and Yod verbs the w and y forms have
become greatly mixed, those with fv having very much the

§ 40. 'AYIN VAV AND YOD VERBS.

99

preponderance. Except in impf. Qal and related parts the
forms with rv and y completely coincide.

2. The weak middle letter always either falls out or
unites in sound with the vowel of the form, hence the stems
form monosyllables with the same vowels in most places
as are in the regular verb, as perf. nj^, n», Hiph. D'^pn.

The Niph., however, has o, from wa, D1pi=D1pi; and in the impf.
Qal and related parts, the fundamental sounds of these verbs, u and
t, ahvays maintain themselves, as Dip', ]^!2\

.

3. As the stem forms a monosyllable, the preformative
letters stand in the open pretone and have tone-long vowels
(chiefly «, as impf. Qal nip^, perf. Niph. D1p2; e froui i in
Hiph. D'^pn), which, of course, are lost when the tone shifts.
Hoph. has ii.

4. With inflectional afformatives (except tern, ten)^ the
compression of the stem retains the tone on the penult, as
nop she stood.

5. The vowels i u being so characteristic of these verbs,
a great effort is made to give them expression; but as they
cannot stand in a shut syllable with two consonants follow-
ing them, § 5. Rem. &, a vowel is inserted between the stem
and the consonantal afformatives, aud i u remain in the open
syllable. The inserted vowel is 6 in perf., and e in impf.

If no vowel be inserted, i. u become e («), o in the shut

syllable.

6. The ordinary form of the intensive is generally avoided.
The intensive is usually formed by doubling the final letter,
as DOip jt?^/.«6\ DOTp {arv = o). § 26 Rem. c}

Rem. a. In these verbs the infiyi. cons, is assumed as root, because
it is the simplest form in which the characteristic t or li is found.
Rem. 6. In Hiph. 1"^ and ''"J? coincide; in the other parts, e.g. Niph.,
Po'el (and Hoph.?), the forms employed are exclusively those of \y.
Only in impf. Qal and related parts is there any divergence.

In Hiph. and Hoph. hiqqhn, hugqatn occasionally appear for he-

Hem. d. The vowel o is inserted in perf. Niph.; and generally in
perf. Hiph. Hiph. sometimes follows rag. verb, flSiH Ex. 20. 25,
Deut. 14. 28; particularly hiph. of HID, Numb. 14. 15, Is. 14. 30, Hos.
2. 5, Ex. 1. 16. The form flbj^n with e for t also occurs, Ex. 19. 23,
Num. 31. 28, Ex. 26. 30.
The vowel e is generally inserted in impf.
Qal, and occasionally in impf. Hiph.

In Niph. the stem o becomes u immediately before the tone, but

6 sometimes remains, Ez. 11. 17; 20. 43 «&c.

The origin of the inserted o and e is obscure. Probably these vowels
arose out of the a and e sounds in Avhich the perf. and impf. originally
terminated. § 31.

appearance of such words as S^^K to be hostile to, f]||J^ to he weary, in
which y is moveable, and the existence of numerous primary nouns with
y as middle letter (§ 41), make the existence of the class of ^"^ stems
certain. The class, however, shews a great tendency to pass over into
1"y, and very few verbs can now be held with certainty to belong to it.
In addition to the two verbs just mentioned and some denominatives
from nouns ^"J^, the following words may be considered examples: I"*! to
seethe, |^^!J to glance, i^ty to grow gray, "V^ to plaster—besides others.
There is another class of verbs which, though sometimes reckoned "'"J^

The principal verbs belonging to this class are the following, which

§ 42. DOUBLE 'AYIN VEEBS.

Verbs Double 'Ay in so entirely resemble in their inflec-
tion verbs 'Ayin Vav, that it is best to treat them immev
diately after this class:

1) As in verbs 'Ayin Vav the stems are monosyllabic, ex-
cept where an unchangeably long vowel or double letter in
the form requires the presence of a third stem-letter, e. g.
participles and infin. abs. Qal, Pi'^el, Poel &c., as ni3D,

The vowels are those of the regular verb except that in
Hiph. the vowel has not risen to i but remains e (or a)\
see § 27 Rem. a\ e. g. Niph. npi, Hiph. npn.

2) Again, the stems being monosyllabic, the preforma-
tive letters stand in open pretone and have tone-long vowels,
precisely as in 'Ayin Vav, as impf. Qal nb^

3) The double letter shews itself with all inflectional
afformatives; and the tone (except in participles) is on the
penult,^ as npi /. n3W.

4) Before the afformatives beginning with a consonant a
vowel is inserted, viz. in the perfects 0, and in the impff.
and related parts, e, as niip.

5) The tone-long e 0, which under the tone maintained
themselves before the double letter, when they lose the
tone become the sharp i it, (See Table § 6. 3.), as 2 pi. fern,
imper. n3''3D-

6) The regular Intensive is quite common. Other forms

' There are exceptions to this law about the place of tone, particularly

in parts with vocalic terminations.

106

§ 42. DOUBLE 'AYIN VERBS.

of the Intensive are Poel^ and Pilpel, which are also much
in use. See § 26. Rem. c.^

Rem.a. Stative verbs. The stative e of perf. Qal is always sharpened
to a (see § 22 Rem. 6); a very few perff. appear with o, Gen. 49. 23,
Job 24. 24. lu inipf. final a and preformative i
(i. e. e in open pre-
tone), are regular, as 7j!?|^, or with first rad. doubled /ffi^,. Gen. 16. 4;
47. 19, Deut. 19. 6, Is. 7. 4, Gen. 21. 11.

Bern. b. In Niph'al a is the ordinary preformative vowel, but i
(e when prolonged) also appears. Ez. 25. 3, Mai. 2. 5, Is. 57. 5. The
final e of Niph. is usually sharpened to a; but e is found, and even
extends itself to the perf. and part, Is. 49. 6, 1 Sam. 15. 9, Ps. 68. 3.
By imitation of verbs 'Ayin Vav the Niph. has occasionally o through-
out; and it may be remarked in general that the two classes 'Ayin
Vav and Double ' Ayin shew an inclination to adopt forms from one
another. 1) In impf. u appears, Is. 42. 4, Prov. 29. 6.
2) In niph. o,
3) In hiph. ?, Ps. 33. 10, Jud. 3. 24.—
Is. 34. 4, Am. 3. 11, Ez. 29. 7.
The perf. hiph. is often in a, Is. 8 23, 2 K. 23. 15; so with gtttt. Deut.

Arise, go down to meet the king of Israel and thou shalt speak
unto him saying, Thus saith the Lord, In the place where the dogs
licked the blood of Naboth shall the dogs lick thy blood, even thine.

§ 44. LAMED HE (LAMED VAV AND YOD) VERBS.

The He in this class of verbs is not a radical, but a mere

vowel sign.

The stems are properly V'*? and >"h^ though forms with
yod have acquired such a preponderance that only a few
traces of stems with vav now appear,

1. When the third radical is final it unites with the cha-
racteristic vowel, and forms a sound which in all cases is
represented by the letter n, except in the pass. part. Qal,
in which yod is written after u:—

a) This sound is in all perff. «, qamec. § 28. 1.
b) in impfi". and participles the broad e, s''ghol {irom dy)\
c) in imperr. the closer e, cere (from lighter ay):,
d) in infin. abss. the ordinary vowel of the regular verb;
e) while in infin. conss. the fern, t has been added, making

the termination oth.

2. When the third radical is not finnl but stands under

inflection:—

1) After a vowelless consonant it surrenders its vowel to
^'''p3=:i^2 (or, it may

the consonant and disappears, § 9. 2,
be held to lose itself in the following vowel).

2) At the end of a syllable it is silent after the pre-
ceding vowel, § 9. 1. Now this vowel being in all cases </,
the diphthongal ay arises: —

§ 44. LAMED HE (LAMED VAY AND YOD) VERBS.

Ill

a) This ay most naturally becomes 6', which prevails ex-

clusively in perff. pass., as Pu. ri"*^?;

b) but e in parts much used may be thinned to «, which
in perf. Qal is found exclusively, and in other perff.
alternatively with 6', as Qal ri"''?3;

c) in the accented syll. before ndh of imperf. and imper.

aij becomes e (s^ghol), as ni"*"?!

Rem. a. For traces of forms T'7 the Lexicon or Concordance may
be consulted on the roots 'b^ and Th^, Hij;, ^^\ '"int^ &c. and their
derivatives.^

Rem. b. The 3 s. f. is sometimes ri73, but usually it assumes the
second fern, termination, as in Parad., Lev. 25. 21 ; 26. 34, Jer. 13. 19.

The infin. abs. is occasionally spelled 1/3, Gen. 26. 28.
The infin. cons, sometimes wants the fem. termination, as Jl/H,
rarely spelled l^il, Gen. 48. 11; 50.20; 31. 28. The termination oth
may also be explained as from wath, or yath.

Rem. c. The thinning of e to ^ is said to be universal before nu
of 1 pi., and almost universal before tern of 2 pi. The third rad. yod
occasionally remains consonantal, esp. in pause and before term. ]1,
as Vbn Deut. 32. 37; 8. 13, cf. Ps. 57. 2, Is. 17. 12; 21. 12; 41. 5.

The verb TXQV) (IHtJ^) io hoiv down forms a very common hithpa lei,
ninritt^n, njnn^';, vav conv. ^innta^^i Gen. is. 2, piur. 42. e &c. cf.
Gen. 21. 16.

Rem. d. In perff. with vav conv. the accent is not usually thrown

foi'ward.

with no helping vowel are possible only when last letter is a omte
(§ 5 Rem. d, end), otherwise the forms 73"! or 7^1 nuist be used.

2. The common verb n^n to be, has some irregularities,—

which may be given:

1) The gutt. when initial takes hat. s^ghol, as imper. n^n.
2) With amj prefixed letter the gutt., when without a

2) When any afformative is appended the vowel as in

other segholates removes to the first syllable.

3) In the plur. yod is sometimes softened into 'aleph be-
fore another yod; and in the cons, the pretonic a, many
times remains.

Rem. a. On account of the thinning of a to i, which was to be
expected in these weak words, it is hardly possible to say whether
such words as fruit &c. belong to the first or to the second class.
See Add. Notes.

Rem, h. The short words hand, blood &c. which follow in their
inflection the first declension, and the words son, name &c. which
follow the third, appear to be contractions of forms dei-ived from
stems n"7. The words Dfcj! father; Htj! brother, fern. ninjSl sinter;
Dn fatlier in law, &c., are also shortened forms belonging to this
class of stems; in which, however, the rejected letter generally ap-
pears under inflection.

118 § 46. THE TWO VERBAL FOEMS, PERFECT AND IMPERFECT.

§ 46/\THE TWO VERBAL FORMS, PERFECT AND
IMPERFECT.

^\

In § 20 only so much was said regarding the Tenses of
the Verb as seemed absolutely necessary for understanding
the Exercises. A full discussion of the subject belongs to
the syntax; but the sections on the Verb can hardly be
closed without some additional notes on the simple verbal
forms.

1. The Perfect. The Perfect expresses a completed action.
1. Now in reference to time such an action may be:— 1) one
just completed from the point of view of the present (the
preter definite) ; as, Against thee only have I sinned ""ii^an
exx. Gen. 3. 11 eaten., 4. 1 have gotten^ Ex. 5. 14 have ye not
Or 2) one completed in the indefinite past (the
fulfilled?
preter indefinite); as, In the beginning God created ^"y^^
exx. Gen. 4. 1 knew^ Job 1. 1. Or 3) one already completed
from the point of view of another past act (pluperfect) ; as,
And God saw every thing that he had made '7\^'^ ; exx. Gen.
2.2,3; 3. 1 ; 19. 27. Or finally, on the opposite side, 4) one
completed from the point of view of another action yet fu-
ture (the future perfect); as, I will draw for thy camels
also until they have done drinking ninc^V 1^? » ®^^- ^®^-
48. 6; Mic. 5. 2.

It will make no difference in the usage of the perf. if
the completed actions, instead of being expressed absolutely,
as in the above sentences, should be conceived and ex-
pressed conditionally, or if they should have no existence
Jehovah my God if I have
except in conception: as, (1)
done this "'^''^j; n« Ps. 7. 4; (3) If ye had not ploughed with
my heifer DPiB'nn Jud. 14. 18; Would God that we had died
^ino 1^ Numb. 14. 2, exx. Judg. 6. 3 ; Is. 1. 9 ; (4) // Jehovah
shall wash away yrV) the filth of the daughter of Zion, Is.
4. 4; exx. Gen. 43. 9 &c.

2. The perf. never expresses any action but one conceived
as completed, but a difference in the manner of conceiving
actions makes the perf. used in several cases where the
present is rather employed in English: — 1) In the case of

9

;

§ 46. THE TWO VERBAL FORMS, TERPECT AND IMPERFECT. 1 1
actions of frequent occurrence— actions which have been
often experienced or observed (perf. of experence) ;
as,
The sparrow findeth a house n«:JO (E. V. hath found), Ps.
This usage is
84. 4; exx. Ps. 10. 3; 33. 13; Prov^ 11. 2, 8.
naturally particularly common in comparisons, Job 7. 9;
and when general truths are expressed negatively^ Ps. 15. 3
2) In the case of the actions or conditions expressed
foil.
by stative verbs, § 22 Rem. a. What the language seizes
upon in this case is not the fact that the condition expressed
by the verb is one that continues^ but rather the fact that
it is a condition that has come into complete existence and
realization, and hence the perf. is made use of to express
it; as, I know ^r\VT that thou wilt be king, 1 Sam. 24. 21
I hate ""nw^ all workers of iniquity, § 38 Exer. ; so, I re-
wmZ^er, Wdt § 16 Exer. &c.; exx. Gen. 6. 13; 18. 13; 27. 14;
To this class
32. 10 (E. v.); Numb. 11. 5; Deut. 12. 31.
3) A
belongs the verb to be, when am &c. is expressed.
lively imagination is very apt to conceive things which are
really future, especially if their occurrence be certain, as
already done, and to describe them in the perf.
This
happens often in making promises or threats, and in the
language of contracts, as, The field give I thee inni Gen.
23. 11 ; And if not, I will take it >m\>b 1 Sam. 2, 16, exx.
Gen. 4. 23 ; 9. 13 ; 17. 20 ; Deut. 15. 6 ; Ruth 4. 3. This usage
is very common in the elevated language of the Prophets,
before whom the future lay so clear and certain as to
be made the basis of new exhortation (prophetic perf.):
Is. 9. 5 foil., 10. 28 foil.

Rem. As the language has no perfect or aorist participle, the
perf. itself is used in subordinate clauses -which serve for adjectival

or participial descriptions.

the participle in English.

The use of the perf. to express momentary actions, and for ex-
pressing the sudden, sharp, occurrence of any action, seems a variety
of its use in 2. 3), 1 Sam. 2. 16.
II. The Imperfect. The impf. expresses an action conceived
as entering upon, or goitig on towards, accomplishment.
1. Such an action may be: — 1) A single action, going on
and unfinished in the present (present); as, Whence come

'

;

§ 46. THE TWO VERBAL FORMS, PERFECT AND IMPERFECT.

ye ^«npi Josh. 9.8; exx. Ex. 5. 15; Jud. 17. 9; Ps. 2. 4.
Or 2) A single action going on in the past, the two being
conceived as contemporaneous (presens preteriti),— in Prose
chiefly when the section of time with which the action
coincides and to which it is parallel and present, is pro-
minently defined by a particle \ as, Then sings Moses "i^B'i i«
Ex. 15. 1; exx. Deut. 4. 41 ; Josh. 8. 30; 1 Kings 16. 21.

2. The kind of progression or imperfection and unfinished
condition of the action may consist in its frequent repeti-
tion:— 1) Either in the present; as, It is said to this day,
1Di<2 Gen. 22, 14; Take of all food which is eaten^ § 35
This usage is very common in comparisons and in

the statement of general truths founded in the nature of
things ; as, A wise son makeih a glad father niS^"' Prov. 10. 1

come in; Numb. 11. 5 used to eat; 1 Sam. 1. 7; 2. 19; Ps.
95. 10.
3. The imperf. is used for the expression of the future—
that which is conceived as entering upon accomplish-
ment:— 1) This may be a future from the point of view of
the real present ; as, A prophet will the Lord raise up unto
Or 2) It may be a
you D"'!?^ Deut. 18. 18, see § 21 Exerc.
future from any other point of view assumed ; as, He took
his eldest son that was to reign ij'td^^ in his stead, 2 Kings

5.

3. 27.

4. The usage in 3. 2) may be taken as the transition to
a common use of the impff. in which it serves for the ex-
Ijression of that class of dependent actions and those shades
of relation among acts and thoughts, for which we rather
use the conditional moods (esp. the potential). Such actions
are strictly future in reference to the assumed point of
relation, and the simple impf. sufficiently expresses them.
For ex.. Of every tree of the garden thou mayest eat ^3Kn
§ 35 Exerc. ; Could we (were we to) know ynill, that he
would say. Bring down your brother, § 39 Exerc. ; Six days

§ 47. THE ADJECTIVE. COMPARISON.

121

shnlt thou (must thou) hihour^ Ex. 20. 9 ; How shall (should)
we siny'i Ts. 137. 4.

5. On the same ground the impf. follows particles ex-
pressing transition, purpose^ result, and the like, as, ])}bb in
The actions introduced by
order that, ]s lest, ^3 that &c.
such particles are strictly consequent and future to some-
thing just stated.

When, however, there is a strong feeling oi purpose, or
when it is meant to be strongly marked, then, of course,
the moods are employed, § 23; just as they are employed
to express that class of future actions which we express in
the Optative &c.

Rem. a. As is the case with the perf., the impf. is verj- much
used in subordinate clauses, which give adjectival or participial
descriptions of the subject of the main clause. The participle itself
is very little used for this purpose.

Rem. b.

It must be assumed that the perf. and impf. are entirely
distinct in meaning, and that the one is never used for the other or
to express the same conception of an act with the other. But it
may readily happen that two distinct conceptions may be entertained
of an action, which may thus be expressed either in the perf. or
impf. Thus any general truth for ex. may be conceived on the one
side as a thing completed, having been many times realized, and
this conception of it would be expressed in the perf., 2. 1); or it
may be conceived on the other side as a thing unfinished, ever
repeating itself, and to express this view of it, the impf. would be

used, 2. 1).

III. The consecutive forms have the same variety of use
as the simple forms, the consec. impf. corresponding to the
simple perf.; and the consec. perf. to the simple impf

§ 47. THE ADJECTIVE. COMPARISON.

1. Comparative Degree. The adjective undergoes no change
of termination or vocalization in comparison. The com-
parative degree is expressed by the positive followed by
lit. good away
the prep. ]p, as, Better than ivine \}yi nil3,
from, or in distinction from wine.

2. Superlative Degree. The superlative is also expressed
by the positive raised into a position of isolation, as for

by a suffix, or by being in the Gen. relation, as He is the
greatest^ bvi^i^ «in lit. the great one (among those referred
to), V33 (tap the youngest of his sons, Dbns the greatest
of them.

Absolute superlativeness is expressed variously, as by
the word ni<p, very, or IKOSl &c. ; or by the repetition of the
word expressing the quality, n^pl^ tS'lp holy of holies =
most holy, D'^nny 12)} the most abject slave.

§ 48. THE NUMERALS.

1. The Cardinal Numbers. 1) The numeral one is an aiij.
agreeing in gender with its noun and standing like other
adjj. after it, as inx B^"'K one man.

2) The number two is a noun, and agrees in gender with
the word which it enumerates, as D"'B^i« ^^'^ two men\ iriB^
D^B'i two women.

3) The other numerals are nouns and disagree in gender
with the words which they enumerate, the formal fem.
going with the real mas. noun and vice versa., as D"'i3 ntJ^'?d
three sons ; nii2i ^b\il three daughters.

4) The tens are the plurals of the units except ttventij
which is the plur. of ten, there being a distinct word lor
hundred.

5) The numerals 2— 10 which are nouns stand most
commonly in the cons, state before the word which they
enumerate, see above 2), 3); they may be used in apposition
with their word, and then they stand either before or,
The other numerals viz.
chiefly in later style, after it.
those from 11 to 19 and the tens are used only in apposition
with their word, and stand chiefly before, though some-

times, after it.

6) The units require the noun enumerated in the plural;
the tens usually take the noun in the singular when they
stand before it, always in the plur. when after it (Gen.
The numbers 11 to 19 usually take the plur.
32. 15, 16).
except with a few common nouns like day, man, year &c.,
and collectives.

7) In Numbers composed of tens and units such as 23
the order may be three and twenty, niB^ W^p] n\n^ sixty two
years. Gen. 5. 20, but also twenty and three, r\^^ \^b\^] Dntrj;
Jud. 10. 2, and sometimes the noun is repeated with both, as
three years and twenty year (by 6), as, nit!^ D"'J?^^'| D'i^ ^^^
seventy five years. Gen. 12. 4; or again n''iB^ ynu'l niB' D^lti'J^
twenty seven years, Gen. 23. 1.

§ 49. PAETICLES. THEIR SUFFIXES.

1

Many woi'ds take the suffixes of nouns without presenting

any peculiarity.

2. In small words is to be observed the fondness for the a

vowel in the tone, as, 2 fern. s. and 1 ^3/. c. ; and in the pretone.
3. After b is inflected n in, but 3 pi. m. is D3. The form 10*?
is probably sing, as well as plur. The suff. of 3 pi. f. is always
yrh (e), but ]n2l and ]niil, the latter broader sound in pause; a
similar distinction perhaps obtains in ]jp. Comp. the suff. of D.
4. A number of words take the suffixes oi plur. nouns. These
are to be divided, however, into two classes:— 1) Words that
are really plur., as "'"IHISt after {hinder parts), with which agrees

nnri and others; and 2) words like ^frj which are derivatives of
To this
n"^ roots and resume their lost yod before suffixes.
class belong also HJ^ unto, and 7j^ upon.

5. Certain particles contain something of the notion of a verb

in them, as nSH ecce, ]^fc$ there is not, Vi'\ there is &c., and hence
not unnaturally take suff. denoting the accus. (verbal), and shew
a particular tendency to strengthen themselves by means of the

demonstrative w, § 31. 5.

The word as, like, uses the base lOD for light suffixes, with
which the accent is on the penult, with pretonic d\ and the base

D for heavy suff., with which the accent is on the last syll., with
pretonic a. The plenary spelling "'ilDS is usual, but the defective

form ^ib3 also appears.

It does not belong to an Elementary Treatise to enumerate
every variation in form; such variations may be found in any
good Lexicon.

The forms with Changeable vowels seem capable of being
generalized under three classes, which may be called De-
clensions:

First Declension. Words with a (— ) in the Tone., or in the

Pretone, or in both.

Second Declension. Segholates; i. e. words originally jnono-
syllabic, with a short vowel, which stood generally after the
first radical, though sometimes after the second.

Third Declension.

ending like them in e (-7-) and having the vowel of the Pre-
tone unchangeable either by nature or position.

The Declension consists of words having tone-long a (—), in

the Tone, or in the Pretone, or in both.

A very few forms without a are inflected in the same way,

See Rules for Declens. § 18.

1. The 7ieio vowel arising when two indistinct sounds come
together, is usually i (—^) but sometimes the word resumes its
original sound, § 6. 2 d.

2. In words of form 2., the final vowel of cons, is a (—), which

alone of the short vowels can stand in the final shut accented syll.

3.

Several words, particularly in form 2., have in cons, the

short vowel after the first radical, i. e. assume the Segholate form,

Second Declens.; and some have both forms.

4. Many words of foi'm 2., retain the vowel e (—) under in-

particularly feminines,

sleeping, 7pN mourning;
as HDIS a pool.
m3N loss, n3J5 tlieft, HDIV heap, HDIK' burning, and probably a
number of others which do not happen to occur in cons, state oi
with Suffixes. With regard to many of these words it may be
impossible to say whether they are of the First or Second Declens.;

]]if^

for ex. n3"^2 a pool is not improbably a segholate of 2nd class,

Arab, birkat.—Some words have both forms, as rjDK' rejoicing.

5. Instead of retaining the tone-long vowel under inflection,
words not unfrequently adopt the sharp short vowel, § 6., 3, and
double the following consonant, since a short vowel and Dagesh
