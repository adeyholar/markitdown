TRANSLATOR’S PREFACE

THE translation of the twenty-sixth German edition of this grammar, originally
prepared by the Rev. G. W. Collins and revised by me, was published in 1898. Since
that date a twenty-seventh German edition has appeared; and Prof. Kautzsch was
already engaged on a twenty-eighth in 1908 when the English translation was
becoming exhausted. He sent me the sheets as they were printed off, and I began
revising the former translation in order to produce it as soon as possible after the
completion of the German. The whole of the English has been carefully compared
with the new edition, and, it is hoped, improved in many points, while Prof.
Kautzsch’s own corrections and additions have of course been incorporated. As
before, the plan and arrangement of the original have been strictly followed, so that
the references for sections and paragraphs correspond exactly in German and English.
Dr. Driver has again most generously given up time, in the midst of other
engagements, to reading the sheets, and has made numerous suggestions. To him also
are chiefly due the enlargement of the index of subjects, some expansions in the new
index of Hebrew words, and some additions to the index of passages, whereby we
hope to have made the book more serviceable to students. I have also to thank my
young friend, Mr. Godfrey R. Driver, of Winchester College, for some welcome help
in correcting proofs of the Hebrew index and the index of passages.
Many corrections have been sent to me by scholars who have used the former English
edition, especially the Rev. W. E. Blomfield, the Rev. S. Holmes, Mr. P. Wilson, Prof.
Witton Davies, Mr. G. H. Skipwith, and an unknown correspondent at West Croydon.
These, as well as suggestions in reviews, have all been considered, and where
possible, utilized. I am also much indebted to the Press-readers for the great care
which they have bestowed on the work.

.

Finally, I must pay an affectionate tribute to the memory of Prof. Kautzsch, who

died in the spring of this year, shortly after finishing the last sheets of the twenty-
eighth edition. For more than thirty years he was indefatigable in improving the
successive editions of the Grammar. The German translation of the Old Testament
first published by him in 1894, with the co-operation of other scholars, under the title
Die Heilige Schrift des A Ts, and now (1910) in the third and much enlarged edition,
is a valuable work which has been widely appreciated: the Apocryphen und
Pseudepigraphen des A Ts, edited by him in 1900, is another important work: besides
which he published his Grammatik des Biblisch-Aramäischen in 1884, two useful
brochures Bibelwissenschaft und Religionsunterricht in 1900, and Die bleibende
Bedeutung des A Ts in 1903, six popular lectures on Die Poesie und die poetischen
Bücher des A Ts in 1902, his article ‘Religion of Israel’ in Hastings’ Dictionary of the
Bible, v. (1904), pp. 612–734, not to mention minor publications. His death is a
serious loss to Biblical scholarship, while to me and to many others it is the loss of a

most kindly friend, remarkable alike for his simple piety and his enthusiasm for
learning.

FROM THE GERMAN PREFACE

THE present (twenty-eighth) edition of this Grammar,1 like the former ones, takes
account as far as possible of all important new publications on the subject, especially
J. Barth’s Sprachwissenschaftliche Untersuchungen zum Semitischen, pt. i, Lpz. 1907;
the important works of C. Brockelmann (for the titles see the heading of § 1; vol. i of
the Grundriss was finished in 1908); P. Kahle’s Der masoretische Text des A Ts nach
der Überlieferung der babylonischen Juden, Lpz. 1902 (giving on p. 51 ff. an outline
of Hebrew accidence from a Babylonian MS. at Berlin); R. Kittel’s Biblia Hebraica,
Lpz. 1905 f., 2 vols. (discriminating between certain, probable, and proposed
emendations; see § 3 g, end); Th. Nöldeke’s Beiträge zur semit. Sprachwissenschaft,
Strassburg, 1904; Ed. Sievers’ Metrische Studien (for the titles of these striking works
see § 2 r). The important work of J. W. Rothstein, Grundzüge des hebr. Rhythmus,
&c. (see also § 2 r), unfortunately appeared too late to be used. The two large
commentaries edited by Nowack and Marti have been recently completed; and in P.
Haupt’s Polychrome Bible (SBOT.), part ix (Kings) by Stade and Schwally was
published in 1904.

For full reviews of the twenty-seventh edition, which of course have been

considered as carefully as possible, I have to thank Max Margolis (in Hebraica, 1902,
p. 159 ff.), Mayer Lambert (REJ. 1902, p. 307 ff.), and H. Oort (Theol. Tijdschrift,
1902, p. 373 ff.). For particular remarks and corrections I must thank Prof. J. Barth
(Berlin), Dr. Gasser, pastor in Buchberg, Schaffhausen, B. Kirschner, of
Charlottenburg, (contributions to the index of passages), Pastor Köhler, of Augst, Dr.
Liebmann, of Kuczkow, Posen, Prof. Th. Nöldeke, of Strassburg, Pastor S. Preiswerk
junior, of Bâle, Dr. Schwarz, of Leipzig, and Prof. B. Stade, of Giessen (died in
1906). Special mention must be made of the abundant help received from three old
friends of this book, Prof. P. Haupt, of Baltimore, Prof. Knudtzon, of Kristiania, and
Prof. H. Strack, of Berlin, and also, in connexion with the present edition, Prof. H.

1 1 The first edition appeared at Halle in 1813 (202 pp. small 8vo); twelve more
editions were published by W. Gesenius himself, the fourteenth to the twenty first
(1845–1872) by E. Rödiger, the twenty-second to the twenty-eighth (1878–1910) by
E. Kautzsch. The first abridged edition appeared in 1896, the second at the same time
as the present (twenty-eighth) large edition. The first edition of the ‘Übungsbuch’
(Exercises) to Gesenius-Kautzsch’s Hebrew Grammar appeared in 1881, the sixth in
1908.

Hyvernat, of the University of Washington, who has rendered great service especially
in the correction and enlargement of the indexes. I take this opportunity of thanking
them all again sincerely. And I am no less grateful also to my dear colleague Prof. C.
Steuernagel for the unwearying care with which he has helped me from beginning to
end in correcting the proof-sheets.

Among material changes introduced into this edition may be mentioned the
abolition of the term Šewâ medium (§ 10 d). In this I have adopted, not without
hesitation, the views of Sievers. I find it, however, quite impossible to follow him in
rejecting all distinctions of quantity in the vowels. It is no doubt possible that such
matters may in the spoken language have worn a very different appearance, and
especially that in the period of nearly a thousand years, over which the Old Testament
writings extend, very great variations may have taken place. Our duty, however, is to
represent the language in the form in which it has been handed down to us by the
Masoretes; and that this form involves a distinction between unchangeable, tone-long,
and short vowels, admits in my opinion of no doubt. The discussion of any earlier
stage of development belongs not to Hebrew grammar but to comparative Semitic
philology.

The same answer may be made to Beer’s desire (ThLZ. 1904, col. 314 f.) for an
‘historical Hebrew grammar describing the actual growth of the language on a basis
of comparative philology, as it may still be traced within the narrow limits of the Old
Testament’. Such material as is available for the purpose ought indeed to be honestly
set forth in the new editions of Gesenius; but Beer seems to me to appraise such
material much too highly when he refers to it as necessitating an ‘historical grammar’.
In my opinion these historical differences have for the most part been obliterated by
the harmonizing activity of the Masoretes.

aided by the analogy of verbs ???, as P. Haupt has suggested to me in conversation.)
But cf. Kautzsch, ‘Die sog. aramaisierenden Formen der Verba ??? im Hebr.’ in
Oriental. Studien zum 70. Geburtstag Th. Nöldekes, 1906, p. 771 ff. It is there shown
(1) that the sharpening of the 1st radical often serves to emphasize a particular
meaning (cf. ?????, but
no doubt to dissimilate the vowels (as ?????, ????? never ?????, ????? &c.): (2) that the
sharpening of the 1st radical often appears to be occasioned by the nature of the first
letter of the stem, especially when it is a sibilant. Whether the masoretic
pronunciation is based on an early tradition, or the Masora has arbitrarily adopted
aramaizing forms to attain the above objects, must be left undecided.

parts published), Giessen, 1900 f. [G. A. Cooke, Handbook of North-Semitic Inscriptions,
Oxford, 1903].

1. The Hebrew language is one branch of a great family of languages in Western
Asia which was indigenous in Palestine, Phoenicia, Syria, Mesopotamia, Babylonia,
Assyria, and Arabia, that is to say, in the countries extending from the Mediterranean
to the other side of the Euphrates and Tigris, and from the mountains of Armenia to
the southern coast of Arabia. In early times, however, it spread from Arabia over
Abyssinia, and by means of Phoenician colonies over many islands and sea-boards of
the Mediterranean, as for instance to the Carthaginian coast. No comprehensive
designation is found in early times for the languages and nations of this family; the
name Semites or Semitic1 languages (based upon the fact that according to Gn 10:21
ff. almost all nations speaking these languages are descended from Shem) is,
however, now generally accepted, and has accordingly been retained here.2

1 1 First used by Sohlözer in Eichhorn’s Repertorium für bibl. u. morgenl. Literatur,
1781, p. 161.
2 2 From Shem are derived (Gn 10:21 ff.) the Aramaean and Arab families as well as
the Hebrews, but not the Canaanites (Phoenicians), who are traced back to Ham (vv.
6.15 ff.), although their language belongs decidedly to what is now called Semitic. The
language of the Babylonians and Assyrians also was long ago shown to be Semitic,
just as Aššur (Gn 10:22) is included among the sons of Shem.

2. The better known Semitic languages may be subdivided1 as follows:—

I. The South Semitic or Arabic branch. To this belong, besides the classical
literary language of the Arabs and the modern vulgar Arabic, the older southern
Arabic preserved in the Sabaean inscriptions (less correctly called Himyaritic), and its
offshoot, the Ge(cid:31)ez or Ethiopic, in Abyssinia.

II. The Middle Semitic or Canaanitish branch. To this belongs the Hebrew of the

Old Testament with its descendants, the New Hebrew, as found especially in the
Mishna (see below, § 3 a), and Rabbinic; also Phoenician, with Punic (in Carthage
and its colonies), and the various remains of Canaanitish dialects preserved in names
of places and persons, and in the inscription of Mêša(cid:31), king of Moab.

III. The North Semitic or Aramaic branch. The subdivisions of this are—(1) The

Eastern Aramaic or Syriac, the literary language of the Christian Syrians. The
religious books of the Mandaeans (Nasoraeans, Sabians, also called the disciples of
St. John) represent a very debased offshoot of this. A Jewish modification of Syriac is
to be seen in the language of the Babylonian Talmud. (2) The Western or Palestinian
Aramaic, incorrectly called also ‘Chaldee’.2 This latter dialect is represented in the
Old Testament by two words in Gn 31:47, by the verse Jer 10:11, and the sections Dn
2:4 to 7:28; Ezr 4:8 to 6:18, and 7:12–26, as well as by a number of non-Jewish
inscriptions and Jewish papyri (see below, under m), but especially by a considerable
section of Jewish literature (Targums, Palestinian Gemara, &c.). To the same branch
belongs also the Samaritan, with its admixture of Hebrew forms, and, except for the
rather Arabic colouring of the proper names, the idiom of the Nabataean inscriptions
in the Sinaitic peninsula, in the East of Palestine, &c.

For further particulars about the remains of Western Aramaic (including those in the New

Test., in the Palmyrene and Egyptian Aramaic inscriptions) see Kautzsch, Gramm. des
Biblisch-Aramäischen, Lpz. 1884, p. 6 ff.

IV. The East Semitic branch, the language of the Assyrio-Babylonian cuneiform

inscriptions, the third line of the Achaemenian inscriptions.

On the importance of Assyrian for Hebrew philology especially from a lexicographical
point of view cf. Friedr. Delitzsch, Prolegomena eines neuen hebr.-aram. Wörterbuchs zum
A. T., Lpz. 1886; P. Haupt, ‘Assyrian Phonology, &c.,’ in Hebraica, Chicago, Jan. 1885, vol.
i. 3; Delitzsch, Assyrische Grammatik, 2nd ed., Berlin, 1906.

If the above division into four branches be reduced to two principal groups, No. I,

as South Semitic, will be contrasted with the three North Semitic branches.1

1 1 For conjectures as to the gradual divergence of the dialects (first the Babylonian,
then Canaanite, including Hebrew, lastly Aramaic and Arabic) from primitive
Semitic, see Zimmern, KAT.3, ii. p. 644 ff.
2 2 In a wider sense all Jewish Aramaic is sometimes called ‘Chaldee’.
1 1 Hommel, Grundriss der Geogr. und Gesch. des alten Orients, Munich, 1904, p. 75
ff., prefers to distinguish them as Eastern and Western Semitic branches. Their
geographical position, however, is of less importance than the genealogical relation of

All these languages stand to one another in much the same relation as those of the

Germanic family (Gothic, Old Norse, Danish, Swedish; High and Low German in their earlier
and later dialects), or as the Slavonic languages (Lithuanian, Lettish; Old Slavonic, Serbian,
Russian; Polish, Bohemian). They are now either wholly extinct, as the Phoenician and
Assyrian, or preserved only in a debased form, as Neo-Syriac among Syrian Christians and
Jews in Mesopotamia and Kurdistan, Ethiopic (Ge(cid:31)ez) in the later Abyssinian dialects
(Tigrê, Tigriña, Amharic), and Hebrew among some modern Jews, except in so far as they
attempt a purely literary reproduction of the language of the Old Testament. Arabic alone has
not only occupied to this day its original abode in Arabia proper, but has also forced its way
in all directions into the domain of other languages.

The Semitic family of languages is bounded on the East and North by another of still
wider extent, which reaches from India to the western limits of Europe, and is called Indo-
Germanic2 since it comprises, in the most varied ramifications, the Indian (Sanskrit), Old and
New Persian, Greek, Latin, Slavonic, as well as Gothic and the other Germanic languages.
With the Old Egyptian language, of which Coptic is a descendant, as well as with the
languages of north-western Africa, the Semitic had from the earliest times much in common,
especially in grammatical structure; but on the other hand there are fundamental differences
between them, especially from a lexicographical point of view; see Erman, ‘Das Verhältnis
des Aegyptischen zu den semitischen Sprachen, ’ in the ZDMG. xlvi, 1892, p. 93 ff., and
Brockelmann, Grundriss, i. 3.

3. The grammatical structure of the Semitic family of languages, as compared

with that of other languages, especially the Indo-Germanic, exhibits numerous
peculiarities which collectively constitute its distinctive character, although many of
them are found singly in other languages. These are—(a) among the consonants,
which in fact form the substance of these languages, occur peculiar gutturals of
different grades; the vowels are subject, within the same consonantal framework, to
great changes in order to express various modifications of the same stem-meaning; (b)
the word-stems are almost invariably triliteral, i.e. composed of three consonants; (c)
the verb is restricted to two tense-forms, with a peculiarly regulated use; (d) the noun
has only two genders (masc. and fem.); and peculiar expedients are adopted for the
purpose of indicating the case-relations; (e) the oblique cases of the personal pronoun,
as well as all the possessive pronouns and the pronominal object of the verb, are
denoted by forms appended directly to the governing word (suffixes); (f) the almost
complete absence of compounds both in the noun (with the exception of many proper
names) and in the verb; (g) great simplicity in the expression of syntactical relations,
e.g. the small number of particles, and the prevalence of simple co-ordination of
clauses without periodic structure. Classical Arabic and Syriac, however, form a not
unimportant exception as regards the last-mentioned point.

4. From a lexicographical point of view also the vocabulary of the Semites differs

essentially from that of the Indo-Germanic languages, although there is apparently
more agreement here than in the grammar. A considerable number of Semitic roots
and stems agree in sound with synonyms in the Indo-Germanic family. But apart from

the various groups of dialects, as rightly pointed out by A. Jeremias in Th.LZ. 1906,
col. 291.

Gött. Gesellschaft, 1901, p. 454.

1846 ff., since 1903 ed. by A. Fischer.

expressions actually borrowed (see below, under i), the real similarity may be reduced
to imitative words (onomatopoetica), and to those in which one and the same idea is
represented by similar sounds in consequence of a formative instinct common to the
most varied families of language. Neither of these proves any historic or generic
relation, for which an agreement in grammatical structure would also be necessary.

Comp. Friedr. Delitzsch, Studien über indogermanisch-semitische Wurzelverwandtschaft,

Lpz. 1873; Nöldechen, Semit. Glossen zu Fick und Curtius, Magdeb. 1876 f.; McCurdy,
Aryo-Semitic Speech, Andover, U.S.A., 1881. The phonetic relations have been thoroughly
investigated by H. Möller in Semitisch und Indogermanisch, Teil i, Konsonanten,
Copenhagen and Lpz. 1907, a work which has evoked considerable criticism.

As onomatopoetic words, or as stem-sounds of a similar character, we may compare, e.g.

?????, ?????? ????, lingo, Skt. lih, Eng. to lick, Fr. lécher, Germ. lecken; ????? (cf. ????, ?????) ?????,
volvo, Germ. quellen, wallen, Eng. to well; ?????, ?????, ?????, ???????, Pers. khâr??dan, Ital.
grattare, Fr. gratter, Eng. to grate, to scratch, Germ. kratzen; ????? frango, Germ. brechen,
&c.; Reuss, Gesch. der hl. Schriften A.T.’s, Braunschw. 1881, p. 38, draws attention moreover
to the Semitic equivalents for earth, six, seven, horn, to sound, to measure, to mix, to smell, to
place, clear, to kneel, raven, goat, ox, &c. An example of a somewhat different kind is am,
ham (sam), gam, kam, in the sense of the German samt, zusammen, together; in Hebrew ????
(whence ????? people, properly assembly), ??? (with) samt, ??? also, moreover, Arab. ??? to
collect; Pers. ham, hamah (at the same time); Skt. samâ (with), Gk. ?µ? (?µ??), ?µ??, ?µ??
(?µ????, ?µ????, and harder ??????, Lat. cum, cumulus, cunctus; with the corresponding
sibilant Skt. sam, Gk. ???, ???, ?????=??????, Goth. sama, Germ. samt, sammeln; but many
of these instances are doubtful.

Essentially different from this internal connexion is the occurrence of the same

words in different languages, where one language has borrowed directly from the
other. Such loan-words are—

(a) In Hebrew: some names of objects which were originally indigenous in Babylonia and

Assyria (see a comprehensive list of Assyrio-Babylonian loan-words in the Hebrew and
Aramaic of the Old Testament in Zimmern and Winckler, KAT.3, ii. p. 648 ff.), in Egypt,
Persia, or India, e.g. ????? (also in the plural) river, from Egyptian yoor, generally as the name
of the Nile (late Egypt. yaro, Assyr. yaruu), although it is possible that a pure Semitic ??? has
been confounded with the Egyptian name of the Nile (so Zimmern);
????  (Egyptian) Nile-reed
(see Lieblein, ‘Mots égyptiens dans la Bible, ’ in PSBA. 1898, p. 202 f.); ??????? (in Zend
pairidaêza, circumvallation=??????????) pleasure-garden, park; ????????? daric, Persian gold
coin; ???????? peacocks, perhaps from the Malabar tôgai or tôghai. Some of these words are also
found in Greek, as ??????? (Pers. karbâs, Skt. karpâsa) cotton, ????????, carbasus. On the other
hand it is doubtful if ??? corresponds to the Greek ?????, ?????, Skt. kapi, ape.

(b) In Greek, &c.: some originally Semitic names of Asiatic products and articles of
commerce, e.g. ??? ??????, byssus; ??????? ???????, ?????????, incense; ????? ???? ?????,
canna, cane; ????? ??µ????, cuminum, cumin; ???????? ??????, cassia; ????? ??µ????, camelus;
???????? ???????, arrhabo, arrha, pledge. Such transitions have perhaps been brought about
chiefly by Phoenician trade. Cf. A. Müller, ‘Semitische Lehnworte im aälteren Griechisch, ’
in Bezzenberger’s Beiträge zur Kunde der Indo-germ. Sprachen, Göttingen, 1877, vol. i. p.

5. No system of writing is ever so perfect as to be able (o reproduce the sounds of
s language in all their various shades, and the writing of the Semites has one striking
fundamental defect, viz. that only the consonants (which indeed form the substance of
the language) are written as real letters,1 whilst of the vowels only the longer are
indicated by certain representative consonants (see below, § 7). It was only later that
special small marks (points or strokes below or above the consonants) were invented
to represent to the eye all the vowel-sounds (see § 8). These are, however, superfluous
for the practised reader, and are therefore often wholly omitted in Semitic manuscripts
and printed texts. Semitic writing, moreover, almost invariably proceeds from right to
left.2

With the exception of the Assyrio-Babylonian (cuneiform), all varieties of Semitic

writing, although differing widely in some respects, are derived from one and the
same original alphabet, represented on extant monuments most faithfully by the
characters used on the stele of Mêša(cid:31), king of Moab (see below, § 2 d), and in the old
Phoenician inscriptions, of which the bronze howls from a temple of Baal (CIS. i. 22
ff. and Plate IV) are somewhat earlier than Mêša(cid:31). The old Hebrew writing, as it
appears on the oldest monument, the Siloam inscription (see below, § 2 d), exhibits
essentially the same character. The old Greek, and indirectly all European alphabets,
are descended from the old Phoenician writing (see § 5 i).

See the Table of Alphabets at the beginning of the Grammar, which shows the relations of

the older varieties of Semitic writing to one another and especially the origin of the present
Hebrew characters from their primitive forms. For a more complete view, see Gesenius’
Scripturae linguaeque Phoeniciae monumenta, Lips. 1837, 4 to, pt. i. p. 15 ff., and pt. iii. tab.
1–5. From numerous monuments since discovered, our knowledge of the Semitic characters,
especially the Phoenician, has become considerably enlarged and more accurate. Cf. the all
but exhaustive bibliography (from 1615 to 1896) in Lidzbarski’s Handbuch der
Nordsemitischen Epigraphik, i. p. 4 ff., and on the origin of the Semitic alphabet, ibid., p. 173
ff., and Ephemeris (see the heading of § 1 a above), i. pp. 109 ff., 142, 261 ff., and his
‘Altsemitische Texte’, pt. i, Kanaanäische Inschriften (Moabite, Old-Hebrew, Phoenician,
Punic), Giessen, 1907.—On the origin and development of the Hebrew characters and the
best tables of alphabets, see § 5 a, last note, and especially § 5 e.

1 1 So also originally the Ethiopic writing, which afterwards represented the vowels
by small appendages to the consonants, or by some other change in their form. On the
Assyrio-Babylonian cuneiform writing, which like-wise indicates the vowels, see the
next note, ad fin.
2 2 The Sabaean (Himyaritic) writing runs occasionally from left to right, and even
alternately in both directions (boustrophedon), but as a rule from right to left. In
Ethiopic writing the direction from left to right has become the rule; some few old
inscriptions exhibit, however, the opposite direction. The cuneiform writing also runs
from left to right, but this is undoubtedly borrowed from a non-Semitic people. Cf. § 5
d, note 3.
CIS. CIS. = Corpus Inscriptionum Semiticarum.

6. As regards the relative age of the Semitic languages, the oldest literary remains

of them are to be found in the Assyrio-Babylonian (cuneiform) inscriptions,1 with
which are to be classed the earliest Hebrew fragments occurring in the old Testament
(see § 2).

The earliest non-Jewish Aramaic inscriptions known to us are that of ??? king of

Hamath (early eighth cent. B.C.), on which see Nöldeke, ZA. 1908, p. 376, and that
found at Teima, in N. Arabia, in 1880, probably of the fifth cent. B.C., cf. E. Littmann
in the Monist, xiv. 4 [and Cooke, op. cit., p. 195]. The monuments of Kalammus of
Sam’al, in the reign of Shalmanezer II, 859–829 B.C. (cf. A. Šanda, Die Aramäer,
Lpz. 1902, p. 26), and those found in 1888–1891 at Zenjîrlî in N. Syria, including the
Hadad inscription of thirty-four lines (early eighth cent. B.C.) and the Panammu
inscription (740 B.C.), are not in pure Aramaic. The Jewish-Aramaic writings begin
about the time of Cyrus (cf. Ezr 6:3 ff.), specially important being the papyri from
Assuan ed. by Sayce and Cowley, London, 1906 (and in a cheaper form by Staerk,
Bonn, 1907), which are precisely dated from 471 to 411 B.C., and three others of 407
B.C. ed. by Sachau, Berlin, 1907.

Monuments of the Arabic branch first appear in the earliest centuries A.D.

(Sabaean inscriptions, Ethiopic translation of the Bible in the fourth or fifth century,
North-Arabic literature from the sixth century A.D.).

It is, however, another question which of these languages has adhered longest and

most faithfully to the original character of the Semitic, and which consequently
represents to us the earliest phase of its development. For the more or less rapid
transformation of the sounds and forms of a language, as spoken by nations and races,
is dependent on causes quite distinct from the growth of a literature, and the organic
structure of a language is often considerably impaired even before it has developed a
literature, especially by early contact with people of a different language. Thus in the
Semitic group, the Aramaic dialects exhibit the earliest and greatest decay, next to
them the Hebrew-Canaanitish, and in its own way the Assyrian. Arabic, owing to the
seclusion of the desert tribes, was the longest to retain the original fullness and purity
of the sounds and forms of words.1 Even here, however, there appeared, through the

1 1 According to Hilprecht, The Babylonian Expedition of the University of
Pennsylvania, i. p. 11 ff., the inscriptions found at Nippur embrace the period from
about 4000 to 450 B.C.
ZA. ZA. = Zeitschrift für Assyriologie und verwandte Gebiete, ed. by C. Bezold. Lpz.
1886 ff.
1 1 Even now the language of some of the Bêdaw?(cid:31) is much purer and more archaic
than that of the town Arabs. It must, however, be admitted that the former exalted
estimate of the primitiveness of Arabic has been moderated in many respects by the
most recent school of Semitic philology. Much apparently original is to be regarded
with Nöldeke (Die semit. Spr., p. 5 [=Encycl. Brit., ed. 9, art. SEMITIC LANGUAGES, p.
642]) only as a modification of the original. The assertion that the Arabs exhibit
Semitic characteristics in their purest form, should, according to Nöldeke, be rather
that ‘the inhabitants of the desert lands of Arabia, under the influence of the
extraordinarily monotonous scenery and of a life continually the same amid continual
change, have developed most exclusively some of the principal traits of the Semitic
race’.

revolutionary influence of Islam, an ever-increasing decay, until Arabic at length
reached the stage at which we find Hebrew in the Old Testament.

Hence the phenomenon, that in its grammatical structure the ancient Hebrew agrees more
with the modern than with the ancient Arabic, and that the latter, although it only appears as a
written language at a later period, has yet in many respects preserved a more complete
structure and a more original vowel system than the other Semitic languages, cf. Nöldeke,
‘Das klassische Arabisch und die arabischen Dialekte, ’ in Beiträge zur semitischen
Sprachwissenschaft, p. 1 ff. It thus occupies amongst them a position similar to that which
Sanskrit holds among the Indo-Germanic languages, or Gothic in the narrower circle of the
Germanic. But even the toughest organism of a language often deteriorates, at least in single
forms and derivatives, while on the contrary, in the midst of what is otherwise universal
decay, there still remains here and there something original and archaic; and this is the case
with the Semitic languages.

Fuller proof of the above statements belongs to the comparative Grammar of the Semitic

languages. It follows, however, from what has been said: (1) that the Hebrew language, as
found in the sacred literature of the Jews, has, in respect to its organic structure, already
suffered more considerable losses than the Arabic, which appears much later on the historical
horizon; (2) that, notwithstanding this fact, we cannot at once and in all points concede
priority to the latter; (3) that it is a mistake to consider with some that the Aramaic, on
account of its simplicity (which is only due to the decay of its organic structure), is the oldest
form of Semitic speech.

§ 2. Sketch of the History of the Hebrew Language

See Gesenius, Gesch. der hebr. Sprache u. Schrift, Lpz. 1815, §§ 5–18; Th. Nöldeke’s
art., ‘Sprache, hebräische,’ in Schenkel’s Bibel-Lexikon, Bd. v, Lpz. 1875; F. Buhl,
‘Hebräische Sprache,’ in Hauck’s Realencycl. für prot. Theol. und Kirche, vii (1899), p.
506 ff.; A. Cowley, ‘Hebrew Language and Literature,’ in the forthcoming ed. of the
Encycl. Brit.; W. R. Smith in the Encycl. Bibl., ii. London, 1901, p. 1984 ff.; A. Lukyn
Williams, ‘Hebrew,’ in Hastings’ Dict. of the Bible, ii. p. 325 ff., Edinb. 1899.

1. The name Hebrew Language usually denotes the language of the sacred

writings of the Israelites which form the canon of the Old Testament. It is also called
Ancient Hebrew in contradistinction to the New Hebrew of Jewish writings of the
post-biblical period (§ 3 a). The name Hebrew language (???????? ????? ?????? ???
???????, ????????) does not occur in the Old Testament itself. Instead of it we find in
Is 19:18 the term language of Canaan, 1 and ???????? in the Jews’ language 2 K 18:26,
28 (cf. Is 36:11, 13) Neh 13:24. In the last-cited passage it already agrees with the
later (post-exilic) usage, which gradually extended the name Jews, Jewish to the
whole nation, as in Haggai, Nehemiah, and the book of Esther.

The distinction between the names Hebrew (???????? ???????) and Israelites (

????? ???? ??? ) is

??

that the latter was rather a national name of honour, with also a religious significance,
employed by the people themselves, while the former appears as the less significant name by
which the nation was known amongst foreigners. Hence in the Old Testament Hebrews are
only spoken of either when the name is employed by themselves as contrasted with foreigners
(Gn 40:15, Ex 2:6 f. 3:18 &c., Jon 1:9) or when it is put in the mouth of those who are not

1 1 That Hebrew in its present form was actually developed in Canaan appears from
such facts as the use of y?m (sea) for the west, nègeb (properly dryness, afterwards as
a proper name for the south of Palestine) for the south.

Israelites (Gn 39:14, 17 41:12 &c.) or, finally, when it is used in opposition to other nations
(Gn 14:13 43:32, Ex 2:11, 13 21:2). In 1 S 13:3, 7 and 14:21 the text is clearly corrupt. In the
Greek and Latin authors, as well as in Josephus, the name ???????, Hebraei,2 &c., alone
occurs. Of the many explanations of the gentilic ???????, the derivation from ????? a country on the
other side with the derivative suffix ? ?? (§ 86 h) appears to be the only one philologically
possible. The name accordingly denoted the Israelites as being those who inhabited the
(cid:31)eber, i.e. the district on the other side of the Jordan (or according to others the Euphrates),
and would therefore originally be only appropriate when used by the nations on this side of
the Jordan or Euphrates. We must, then, suppose that after the crossing of the river in question
it had been retained by the Abrahamidae as an old-established name, and within certain limits
(see above) had become naturalized among them. In referring this name to the patronymic
Eber, the Hebrew genealogists have assigned to it a much more comprehensive signification.
For since in Gn 10:21 (Nu 24:24 does not apply) Shem is called the father of all the children
of Eber, and to the latter there also belonged according to Gn 11:14 ff. and 10:25 ff. Aramean
and Arab races, the name, afterwards restricted in the form of the gentilic (cid:31)br?? exclusively to
the Israelites, must have originally included a considerably larger group of countries and
nations. The etymological significance of the name must in that case not be insisted upon.1

The term ???????? is first used, to denote the old Hebrew, in the prologue to Jesus the son
of Sirach (about 130 B.C.), and in the New Testament, Rv 9:11. On the other hand it serves in
Jn 5:2, 19:13, 17 perhaps also in 19:20 and Rv 16:16 to denote what was then the (Aramaic)
vernacular of Palestine as opposed to the Greek. The meaning of the expression ??????
????????? in Acts 21:40, 22:2, and 26:14 is doubtful (cf. Kautzsch, Gramm. des Bibl.-Aram.,
p. 19 f.). Josephus also uses the term Hebrew both of the old Hebrew and of the Aramaic
vernacular of his time.

The Hebrew language is first called the sacred language in the Jewish-Aramaic versions

of the Old Testament, as being the language of the sacred books in opposition to the lingua
profana, i.e. the Aramaic vulgar tongue.

2. With the exception of the Old Testament (and apart from the Phoenician

inscriptions; see below, f–h), only very few remains of old Hebrew or old Canaanitish
literature have been preserved. Of the latter—(1) an inscription, unfortunately much
injured, of thirty-four lines, which was found in the ancient territory of the tribe of
Reuben, about twelve miles to the east of the Dead Sea, among the ruins of the city of
D??bôn (now D??bân), inhabited in earlier times by the Gadites, afterwards by the
Moabites. In it the Moabite king Mêša(cid:31) (about 850 B.C.) recounts his battles with
Israel (cf. 2 K 3:4 ff.), his buildings, and other matters.2 Of old Hebrew: (2) an

2 2 The Graeco-Roman form of the name is not directly derived from the Hebrew
???????, but from the Palestinian Aramaic (cid:31)ebr?y?, ‘the Hebrew.’
1 1 We may also leave out of account the linguistically possible identification of the
(cid:31)Ibriyy?(cid:31)m with the (cid:31)abiri who appear in the Tell-el-Amarna letters (about 1400
B.C.) as freebooters and mercenaries in Palestine and its neighbourhood.
2 2 This monument, unique of its kind, was first seen in August, 1868, on the spot, by
the German missionary F. A. Klein. It was afterwards broken into pieces by the
Arabs, so that only an incomplete copy of the inscription could be made. Most of the
fragments are now in the Louvre in Paris. For the history of the discovery and for the
earlier literature relating to the stone, see Lidzbarski, Nordsemitische Epigraphik, i.
pp. 103 f., 415 f., and in the bibliography (under Me), p. 39 ff. The useful
reproduction and translation of the inscription by Smend and Socin (Freiburg in
Baden, 1886) was afterwards revised and improved by Nordlander, Die Inschrift des

inscription of six lines (probably of the eighth century B.C.1) discovered in June, 1880,
in the tunnel between the Virgin’s Spring and the Pool of Siloam at Jerusalem; (3)
about forty engraved seal-stones, some of them pre-exilic but bearing little except
proper names2; (4) coins of the Maccabaean prince Simon (from ‘the 2nd year of
deliverance’, 140 and 139 B.C.) and his successors,3 and the coinage of the revolts in
the times of Vespasian and Hadrian.

3. In the whole series of the ancient Hebrew writings, as found in the Old

Testament and also in non-biblical monuments (see above, d), the language (to judge
from its consonantal formation) remains, as regards its general character, and apart
from slight changes in form and differences of style (see k to w), at about the same
stage of development. In this form, it may at an early time have been fixed as a
literary language, and the fact that the books contained in the Old Testament were
handed down as sacred writings, must have contributed to this constant uniformity.

Buch Daniel, Lpz. 1904, p. 122 ff. (also in ZDMG. 1905, p. 723 ff.), but without
justification, as shown by E. König in ZDMG. 1905, pp. 233 ff. and 743 ff. [Cf. also
Driver, Notes on the Hebrew Text of the Books of Samuel, Oxford, 1890, p. lxxxv ff.;
Cooke, op. cit., p. 1 ff.]
1 1 Of this inscription—unfortunately not dated, but linguistically and
palaeographically very important—referring to the boring of the tunnel, a facsimile is
given at the beginning of this grammar. See also Lidzbarski, Nordsemitische
Epigraphik, i. 105, 163, 439 (bibliography, p. 56 ff.; facsimile, vol. ii, plate xxi, 1); on
the new drawing of it by Socin (ZDPV. xxii. p. 61 ff. and separately published at
Freiburg i. B. 1899), see Lidzbarski, Ephemeris, i. 53 ff. and 310 f. (text in Altsemit.
Texte, p. 9 f.). Against the view of A. Fischer (ZDMG. 1902, p. 800 f.) that the six
lines are the continuation of an inscription which was never executed, see Lidzbarski,
Ephemeris, ii. 71. The inscription was removed in 1890, and broken into six or seven
pieces in the process. It has since been well restored, and is now in the Imperial
Museum at Constantinople. If, as can hardly be doubted, the name ???? ?? (i.e. emissio)
Is 8:6 refers to the discharge of water from the Virgin’s Spring, through the tunnel (so
Stade, Gesch. Isr. i. 594), then the latter, and consequently the inscription, was
already in existence about 736 B.C. [Cf. Cooke, op. cit., p. 15 ff.]

To this old Hebrew, the language of the Canaanitish or Phoenician 4 stockscame the
nearest of all the Semitic languages, as is evident partly from the many Canaanitish names of
persons and places with a Hebrew form and meaning which occur in the Old Testament (e.g.
?????????????, ????? ???????, &c.; on ‘Canaanite glosses’1 to Assyrian words in the cuneiform tablets of
Tell-el-Amarna [about 1400 B.C.] cf. H. Winckler, ‘Die Thontafeln von Tellel-Amarna, ’ in
Keilinschr. Bibliothek, vol. v, Berlin, 1896 f. [transcription and translation]; J. A. Knudtzon,
Die El-Amarna-Tafeln, Lpz. 1907 f.; H. Zimmern, ZA. 1891, p. 154 ff. and KAT.3, p. 651 ff.),
and partly from the numerous remains of the Phoenician and Punic languages.

The latter we find in their peculiar writing (§ 1 k, l) in a great number of inscriptions and

on coins, copies of which have been collected by Gesenius, Judas, Bourgade, Davis, de
Vogüé, Levy, P. Schröder, v. Maltzan, Euting, but especially in Part I of the Corpus
Inscriptionum Semiticarum, Paris, 1881 ff. Among the inscriptions but few public documents
are found, e.g. two lists of fees for sacrifices; by far the most are epitaphs or votive tablets. Of
special importance is the inscription on the sarcophagus of King Ešmûnazar of Sidon, found
in 1855, now in the Louvre; see the bibliography in Lidzbarski, Nordsem. Epigr., i. 23 ff.; on
the inscription, i. 97 ff., 141 f., 417, ii. plate iv, 2; [Cooke, p. 30 ff.]. To these may be added
isolated words in Greek and Latin authors, and the Punic texts in Plautus, Poenulus 5, 1–3
(best treated by Gildemeister in Ritschl’s edition of Plautus, Lips. 1884, tom. ii, fasc. 5). From
the monuments we learn the native orthography, from the Greek and Latin transcriptions the
pronunciation and vocalization; the two together give a tolerably distinct idea of the language
and its relation to Hebrew.

Phoenician (Punic) words occurring in inscriptions are, e.g. ?? God, ??? man, ?? son, ??
daughter, ??? king, ??? servant, ??? priest, ??? sacrifice, ??? lord, ??? sun, ??? land, ?? sea,
??? stone, ??? silver, ???? iron, ??? oil, ?? time, ??? grave, ???? monument, ??? place, ????
bed, ?? all, ??? one, ???? two, ??? three, ???? four, ??? five, ?? six, ??? seven, ??? ten, ??
(=Hebr. ???) to be, ??? to hear, ??? to open, ??? to vow, ??? to bless, ??? to seek, &c. Proper
names: ??? Sidon, ?? Tyre, ??? Hanno, ????? Hannibal, &c. See the complete vocabulary in
Lidzbarski, Nordsem. Epigr., i. 204 ff.

Variations from Hebrew in Phoenician orthography and inflection are, e.g. the almost

invariable omission of the vowel letters (§ 7 b), as ?? for ??? house, ?? for ??? voice, ??? for
??????, ???? for ????????? priests, ???? (in Plaut. alonim) gods ; the fem., even in the absolute state,
ending in ? (ath) (§ 80 b) as well as ? (ô), the relative ?? (Hebr. ? ????), &c. The differences in
pronunciation are more remarkable, especially in Punic, where the ? was regularly pronounced
as û, e.g. ????? sûf?? (judge), ?? ?? s?lûs (three), ?? rûs = ???? head; i and e often as the
obscure dull sound of y, e.g. ?????? ynnynnu (ecce eum), ??? (???) yth; the ? as o, e.g. ???? Mocar
(cf. ???????? LXX, Gn 22:24 ????). See the collection of the grammatical peculiarities in
Gesenius, Monuments Phoenicia, p. 430 ff.; Paul Schröder, Die phöniz. Sprache, Halle, 1869;
B. Stade, ‘Erneute Pröfung des zwischen dem Phönic. und Hebr. bestehenden
Verwandtschaftsgrades,’ in the Morgenländ. Forschungen, Lpz. 1875, p. 169 ff.

4 4 ???????, ?????????? is the native name, common both to the Canaanitish tribes in Palestine
and to those which dwelt at the foot of the Lebanon and on the Syrian coast, whom we
call Phoenicians, while they called themselves ???? on their coins. The people of
Carthage also called themselves so.
1 1 Cf. inter alia : aparu, also (cid:31)aparu (Assyr. epru, ipru)=?????; (cid:31)ullu=??? (with hard
?; cf. § 6 c, and Assyr. (cid:31)umri=???????, (cid:31)azzatu = ?????); iazkur = ???????, zuru(cid:31)u = ?????,
abadat = ???????, ša(cid:31)ri = ??? ??, gate; ba(cid:31)nu = ?????, belly; kil?bi = ?????, net; (cid:31)aduk = ?????
(??????), &c. [Cf. Böhl, Die Sprache d. Amarnabriefe, Lpz. 1909.]

4. As the Hebrew writing on monuments and coins mentioned in d consists only

of consonants, so also the writers of the Old Testament books used merely the
consonant-signs (§ 1 k), and even now the written scrolls of the Law used in the
synagogues must not, according to ancient custom, contain anything more. The
present pronunciation of this consonantal text, its vocalization and accentuation, rest
on the tradition of the Jewish schools, as it was finally fixed by the system of
punctuation (§ 7 h) introduced by Jewish scholars about the seventh century A.D.; cf. §
3 b.

An earlier stage in the development of the Canaanitish-Hebrew language, i.e. a

form of it anterior to the written documents now extant, when it must have stood
nearer to the common language of the united Semitic family, can still be discerned in
its principal features:—(1) from many archaisms preserved in the traditional texts,
especially in the names of persons and places dating from earlier times, as well as in
isolated forms chiefly occurring in poetic style; (2) in general by an a posteriori
conclusion from traditional forms, so far as according to the laws and analogies of
phonetic change they clearly point to an older phase of the language; and (3) by
comparison with the kindred languages, especially Arabic, in which this earlier stage
of the language has been frequently preserved even down to later times (§ 1 m, n). In
numerous instances in examining linguistic phenomena, the same—and consequently
so much the more certain—result is attained by each of these three methods.

Although the systematic investigation of the linguistic development indicated above
belongs to comparative Semitic philology, it is nevertheless indispensable for the scientific
treatment of Hebrew to refer to the groundforms1 so far as they can be ascertained and to
compare the corresponding forms in Arabic. Even elementary grammar which treats of the
forms of the language occurring in the Old Testament frequently requires, for their
explanation, a reference to theseground-forms.

5. Even in the language of the Old Testament, notwithstanding its general

uniformity, there is noticeable a certain progress from an earlier to a later stage. Two
periods, though with some reservations, may be distinguished: the first, down to the
end of the Babylonian exile; and the second, after the exile.

To the former belongs, apart from isolated traces of a later revision, the larger half

of the Old Testament books, viz. (a) of the prose and historical writings, a large part
of the Pentateuch and of Joshua, Judges, Samuel, and Kings; (b) of the poetical,
perhaps a part of the Psalms and Proverbs; (c) the writings of the earlier prophets
(apart from various later additions) in the following chronological order: Amos,
Hosea, Isaiah I, Micah, Nahum, Zephaniah, Habakkuk, Obadiah (?), Jeremiah,
Ezekiel, Isaiah II (ch. 40–55).

The beginning of this period, and consequently of Hebrew literature generally, is

undoubtedly to be placed as early as the time of Moses, although the Pentateuch in its present
form, in which very different strata may be still clearly recognized, is to be regarded as a
gradual production of the centuries after Moses. Certain linguistic peculiarities of the
Pentateuch, which it was once customary to regard as archaisms, such as the epicene use of

1 1 Whether these can be described simply as ‘primitive Semitic’ is a question which
may be left undecided here.

????? boy, youth, for ???????? girl, and ??? for ???, are merely to be attributed to a later redactor; cf.
§ 17 c.

The linguistic character of the various strata of the Pentateuch has been examined by

Ryssel, De Elohistae Pentateuchici sermone, Lpz. 1878; König, De criticae sacrae
argumento e linguae legibus repetito, Lpz. 1879 (analysis of Gn 1–11); F. Giesebrecht, ‘Der
Sprachgebr. des hexateuchischen Elohisten,’ in ZAW. 1881, p. 177 ff., partly modified by
Driver in the Journal of Philology, vol. xi. p. 201 ff.; Kräutlein, Die sprachl.
Verschiedenheiten in den Hexateuchquellen, Lpz. 1908.—Abundant matter is afforded also
by Holzinger, Einleitung in den Hexateuct, Freib. 1893; Driver, Introduction to the Literature
of the Old Testament8, Edinburgh, 1908; Strack, Einleitung ins A. T.6, Munich, 1906; König,
Einleitung in das A. T., Bonn, 1893.

6. Even in the writings of this first period, which embraces about 600 years, we
meet, as might be expected, with considerable differences in linguistic form and style,
which are due partly to differences in the time and place of composition, and partly to
the individuality and talent of the authors. Thus Isaiah, for example, writes quite
differently from the later Jeremiah, but also differently from his contemporary Micah.
Amongst the historical books of this period, the texts borrowed from earlier sources
have a linguistic colouring perceptibly different from those derived from later sources,
or passages which belong to the latest redactor himself. Yet the structure of the
language, and, apart from isolated cases, even the vocabulary and phraseology, are on
the whole the same, especially in the prose books.

But the poetic language is in many ways distinguished from prose, not only by a
rhythm due to more strictly balanced (parallel) members and definite metres (see r),
but also by peculiar words and meanings, inflexions and syntactical constructions
which it uses in addition to those usual in prose. This distinction, however, does not
go far as, for example, in Greek. Many of these poetic peculiarities occur in the
kindred languages, especially in Aramaic, as the ordinary modes of expression, and
probably are to be regarded largely as archaisms which poetry retained. Some
perhaps, also, are embellishments which the Hebrew poets who knew Aramaic
adopted into their language.1

The prophets, at least the earlier, in language and rhythm are to be regarded

almost entirely as poets, except that with them the sentences are often more extended,
and the parallelism is less regular and balanced than is the case with the poets
properly so called. The language of the later prophets, on the contrary, approaches
nearer to prose.

number of syllables between the beats is only limited by the physiological possibilities of
phonetics; C.v. Orelli, ‘Zur Metrik der alttest. Prophetenschriften,’ in his Kommentar zu den
kl. Propheten3, p. 236 ff., Munich, 1908.—In full agreement with Sievers is Baethgen,
Psalmen3, p. xxvi ff., Göttingen, 1904. [Cf. Budde in DB. iv. 3 ff.; Duhm in EB. iii. 3793 ff.]

Of all views of this matter, the only one generally accepted as sound was at first Ley’s
and Budde’s discovery of the Qina- or Lamentation-Verse (ZAW. 1882, 5 ff.; 1891, 234 ff.;
1892, 31 ff.). On their predecessors, Lowth, de Wette, Ewald, see Löhr, Klagelied2, p. 9. This
verse, called by Duhm ‘long verse’, by Sievers simply ‘five-syllabled’ (Fünfer), consists of
two members, the second at least one beat shorter than the other. That a regular repetition of
an equal number of syllables in arsis and thesis was observed by other poets, had been
established by Ley, Duhm, Gunkel, Grimme, and others, especially Zimmern, who cites a
Babylonian hymn in which the members are actually marked (ZA. x. 1 ff., xii. 382 ff.; cf. also
Delitzsch, Das babyl. Weltschöpfungsepos, Lpz. 1896, pp. 60 ff.). Recently, however, E.
Sievers, the recognized authority on metre in other branches of literature, has indicated, in the
works mentioned above, a number of fresh facts and views, which have frequently been
confirmed by the conclusions of Ley and others. The most important are as follows:—

Hebrew poetry, as distinguished from the quantitative Classical and Arabic and the
syllabic Syriac verse, is accentual. The number of unstressed syllables between the beats
(ictus) is, however, not arbitrary, but the scheme of the verse is based on an irregular anapaest
which may undergo rhythmical modifications (e.g. resolving the ictus into two syllables, or
lengthening the arsis so as to give a double accent) and contraction, e.g. of the first two
syllables. The foot always concludes with the ictus, so that toneless endings, due to change of
pronunciation or corruption of the text, are to be disregarded, although as a rule the ictus
coincides with the Hebrew word-accent. The metrical scheme consists of combinations of feet
in series (of 2, 3 or 4), and of these again in periods—double threes, very frequently, double
fours in narrative, fives in Lamentations (see above) and very often elsewhere, and sevens.
Sievers regards the last two metres as catalectic double threes and fours. Connected sections
do not always maintain the same metre throughout, but often exhibit a mixture of metres.

It can no longer be doubted that in the analysis of purely poetical passages, this system
often finds ready confirmation and leads to textual and literary results, such as the elimination
of glosses. There are, however, various difficulties in carrying out the scheme consistently
and extending it to the prophetical writings and still more to narrative: (1) not infrequently the
required number of feet is only obtained by sacrificing the clearly marked parallelism, or the
grammatical connexion (e.g. of the construct state with its genitive), and sometimes even by

ThLZ. ThLZ. = Theologische Literaturzeitung, ed. by E. Schürer. Lpz. 1876 ff.

means of doubtful emendations; (2) the whole system assumes a correct transmission of the
text and its pronunciation, for neither of which is there the least guarantee. To sum up, our
conclusion at present is that for poetry proper some assured and final results have been
already obtained, and others may be expected, from the principles laid down by Sievers,
although, considering the way in which the text has been transmitted, a faultless arrangement
of metres cannot be expected. Convincing proof of the consistent use of the same metrical
schemes in the prophets, and a fortiori in narrative, can hardly be brought forward.

The great work of D. H. Müller, Die Propheten in ihrer ursprüngl. Form (2 vols., Vienna,

1896; cf. his Strophenbau u. Respension, ibid. 1898, and Komposition u. Strophenbau, ibid.
1907), is a study of the most important monuments of early Semitic poetry from the point of
view of strophic structure and the use of the refrain, i.e. the repetition of the same or similar
phrases or words in corresponding positions in different strophes.

The arrangement of certain poetical passages in verse-form required by early scribal rules

(Ex 15:1–19; Dt 32:1–43; Ju 5; 1 S 2:1–10; 2 S 22, 23:1–7; Ps 18, 136; Pr. 31:10–31; 1 Ch
16:8–36: cf. also Jo 12:9–24; Ec 3:2–8; Est 9:7–10) has nothing to do with the question of
metre in the above sense.

Words are used in poetry, for which others are customary in prose, e.g. ????? man = ????;

????? path = ??????; ????? word = ?????; ????? to see = ????; ???? to come = ???.

To the poetic meanings of words belongs the use of certain poetic epithets as substantives;

thus, for example, ???? (only in constr, st. ??????) the strong one for God; ????? the strong one
for bull, horse; ??????? alba for luna; ??? enemy for ?????.

Of word-forms, we may note, e.g. the longer forms of prepositions of place (§ 103 n) ?????
,  ???

??
???
= ???, ????? = ???, ????? = ???; the endings ? ??, ? in the noun (§ 90); the pronominal suffixes ??,
?? for ?, ? ??, ? ?? (§ 58); the plural ending ?? ?? for ?? ?? (§ 87 e). To the syntax belongs the far
more sparing use of the article, of the relative pronoun, of the accusative particle ???; the
construct state even before prepositions; the shortened imperfect with the same meaning as
the ordinary form (§ 109 i); the wider governing power of prepositions; and in general a
forcible brevity of expression.

7. The second period of the Hebrew language and literature, after the return from
the exile until the Maccabees (about 160 B.C.), is chiefly distinguished by a constantly
closer approximation of the language to the kindred western Aramaic dialect. This is
due to the influence of the Aramaeans, who lived in close contact with the recent and
thinly-populated colony in Jerusalem, and whose dialect was already of importance as
being the official language of the western half of the Persian empire. Nevertheless the
supplanting of Hebrew by Aramaic proceeded only very gradually. Writings intended
for popular use, such as the Hebrew original of Jesus the son of Sirach and the book
of Daniel, not only show that Hebrew about 170 B.C. was still in use as a literary
language, but also that it was still at least understood by the people.1 When it had
finally ceased to exist as a living language, it was still preserved as the language of

1 1 The extensive use of Hebrew in the popular religious literature which is partly
preserved to us in the Midrašim, the Mišna, and the Liturgy, indicates, moreover, that
Hebrew was widely understood much later than this. Cf. M. H. Segal, ‘Mišnaic
Hebrew and its relations to Biblical Hebrew and Aramaic,’ in JQR., 1908, p. 647 ff.
(also separately).

the Schools—not to mention the numerous Hebraisms introduced into the Aramaic
spoken by the Jews.

For particulars, see Kautzsch, Gramm. des Bibl.-Aram., pp. 1–6. We may conveniently
regard the relation of the languages which co-existed in this later period as similar to that of
the High and Low German in North Germany, or to that of the High German and the common
dialects in the south and in Switzerland. Even amongst the more educated, the common
dialect prevails orally, whilst the High German serves essentially as the literary and cultured
language, and is at least understood by all classes of the people. Wholly untenable is the
notion, based on an erroneous interpretation of Neh 8:8, that the Jews immediately after the
exile had completely forgotten the Hebrew language, and therefore needed a translation of the
Holy Scriptures.

The Old Testament writings belonging to this second period, in all of which the
Aramaic colouring appears in various degrees, are: certain parts of the Pentateuch and
of Joshua, Ruth, the books of Ezra, Nehemiah, Chronicles, Esther; the prophetical
books of Haggai, Zechariah, Isaiah III (56–66), Malachi, Joel, Jonah, Daniel; of the
poetical books, a large part of Proverbs, Job, Song of Songs, Ecclesiastes, and most of
the Psalms. As literary compositions, these books are sometimes far inferior to those
of the first period, although work was still produced which in purity of language and
aesthetic value falls little short of the writings of the golden age.

Later words (Aramaisms) are, e.g. ?????? declaration, ???? compel, ??? son, ???? chalk, ????? = ???

time, ????? raise up, ??? Pi. reproach, ??? Pi. roof over, ????? stray, ??? rock, ??? advise, ??? = ???
end, ????? = ????? take, ????? = ????? break, ??? ?? be many, ??? ?? = ?????? rule, ????? = ???? be strong.—
Later meanings are, e.g. ???? (to say) to command; ????? (to answer) to being speaking.—
Orthographical and grammatical peculiarities are, the frequent scriptio plena of ? and ? ??, e.g.
??????1 (elsewhere ?????), even
more frequent use of substantives in ??, ? ??, ??, &c. Cf. Dav. Strauss, Sprachl. Studien zu d.
hebr. Sirachfragmenten, Zürich, 1900, p. 19 ff.; for the Psalms Cheyne, Origin of the Psalter,
p. 461 ff., and especially Giesebrecht in ZAW. 1881, p. 276 ff.; in general, Kautzsch, Die
Aramaismen im A. T. (i, Lexikal. Teil), Halle, 1902.

?????  for ?????, ??? for ???; the interchange of ? ?? and ? ?? final; the

But all the peculiarities of these later writers are not Aramaisms. Several do not occur in
Aramaic and must have belonged at an earlier period to the Hebrew vernacular, especially it
would seem in northern Palestine. There certain parts of Judges, amongst others, may have
originated, as is indicated, e.g. by  ??, a common form in Phoenician (as well as ??), for ? ???? (§
36), which afterwards recurs in Jonah, Lamentations, the Song of Songs, the later Psalms, and
Ecclesiastes.

Rem. 1. Of dialectical varieties in the old Hebrew language, only one express mention
occurs in the O. T. (Ju 12:6), according to which the Ephraimites in certain cases pronounced
the ? as ?. (Cf. Marquart in ZAW. 1888, p. 151 ff.) Whether in Neh 13:24 by the speech of
Ashdod a Hebrew, or a (wholly different) Philistine dialect is intended, cannot be determined.
On the other hand, many peculiarities in the North Palestinian books (Judges and Hoses) are
probably to be regarded as differences in dialect, and so also some anomalies in the Moabite
inscription of Mêša(cid:31) (see above, d). On later developments see L. Metman, Die hebr.
Sprache, ihre Geschichte u. lexikal. Entwickelung seit Abschluss des Kanons u. ihr Bau in d.
Gegenwart, Jerusalem, 1906.

1 1 ?????? in the Minor Prophets throughout (He 3:5, &c.) is due merely to a caprice of
the Masoretes.

2. It is evident that, in the extant remains of old Hebrew literature,2 the entire store of the
ancient language is not preserved. The canonical books of the Old Testament formed certainly
only a fraction of the whole Hebrew national literature.

1. At the time when the old Hebrew language was gradually becoming extinct,
and the formation of the O. T. canon was approaching completion, the Jews began to
explain and critically revise their sacred text, and sometimes to translate it into the
vernacular languages which in various countries had become current among them.
The oldest translation is the Greek of the Seventy (more correctly Seventy-two)
Interpreters (LXX), which was begun with the Pentateuch at Alexandria under
Ptolemy Philadelphus, but only completed later. It was the work of various authors,
some of whom had a living knowledge of the original, and was intended for the use of
Greek-speaking Jews, especially in Alexandria. Somewhat later the Aramaic
translations, or Targums (?????????? i.e. interpretations), were formed by successive
recensions made in Palestine and Babylonia. The explanations, derived in part from
alleged tradition, refer almost exclusively to civil and ritual law and dogmatic
theology, and are no more scientific in character than much of the textual tradition of
that period. Both kinds of tradition are preserved in the Talmud, the first part of
which, the Mišna, was finally brought to its present form towards the end of the
second century; of the remainder, the Gem?ra, one recension (the Jerusalem or
Palestinian Gem.) about the middle of the fourth century, the other (the Babylonian
Gem.) about the middle of the sixth century A.D. The Mišna forms the beginning of
the New-Hebrew literature; the language of the Gemaras is for the most part Aramaic.

2. To the interval between the completion of the Talmud and the earliest

grammatical writers, belong mainly the vocalization and accentuation of the hitherto
unpointed text of the O.T., according to the pronunciation traditional in the
Synagogues and Schools (§ 7 h, i), as well as the greater part of the collection of
critical notes which bears the name of Mas?ra (???????? traditio ?).1 From this the text

2 2 According to the calculation of the Dutch scholar Leusden, the O.T. contains 5,642
different Hebrew and Aramaic words; according to rabbinical calculations, 79,856
altogether in the Pentateuch. Cf. also E. Nestle, ZAW. 1906, p. 283; H. Strack, ZAW.
1907, p. 69 ff.; Blau, ‘Neue masoret. Studien, ’ in JQR. xvi. 357 ff., treats of the
number of letters and words, and the ve sedivision in the O.T.
1 1 On the name Masora (or Massora, as e.g. E. König, Einleitung in das A. T., p. 38
ff.; Lehrgeb. d. hebr. Sprache, ii. 358 ff.), and the great difficulty of satisfactorily
explaining it, cf. De Lagarde, Mitteilungen, i. 91 ff. W. Bacher’s derivation of the
expression (in JQR. 1891, p. 785 ff.; so also C. Levias in the Hebrew Union College
Annual, Cincinnati, 1904, p. 147 ff.) from Ez 20:37 (???????? ???????; ????, i. e. ????????,

which has since been transmitted with rigid uniformity by the MSS., and is still the
received text of the O.T., has obtained the name of the Masoretic Text.

E. F. K. Rosenmüller already (Handbuch für d. Liter. der bibl. Kritik u. Exegese, 1797, i.

247; Vorrede zur Stereotyp-Ausg. des A. T., Lpz. 1834) maintained that our O. T. text was
derived from Codices belonging to a single recension. J. G. Sommer (cf. Cornill, ZAW. 1892,
p. 309), Olshausen (since 1853), and especially De Lagarde (Proverbien, 1863, p. 1 ff.), have
even made it probable that the original Masoretic text was derived from a single standard
manuscript. Cf., however, E. König in Ztschr. f. kirchl. Wiss., 1887, p. 279 f., and especially
his Einleitung ins A. T., p. 88 ff. Moreover a great many facts, which will be noticed in their
proper places, indicate that the Masora itself is by no means uniform but shows clear traces of
different schools and opinions; cf. H. Strack in Semitic Studies in memory of … Kohut, Berlin,
1897, p. 563 ff. An excellent foundation for the history of the Masora and the settlement of
the masoretic tradition was laid by Joh. Buxtorf in his Tiberias seu Commentarius
Masorethicus, first published at Basel in 1620 as an appendix to the Rabbinical Bible of 1618
f. For more recent work see Geiger, Jüdische Ztschr., iii. 78 ff., followed by Harris in JQR. i.
128 ff., 243 ff.; S. Frensdorff. Ochla W’ochla, Hanover, 1864; and his Massor. Wörterb., part
i, Hanover and Lpz. 1876; and Ch. D. Ginsburg, The Massora compiled from Manuscripts,
&c., 3 vols., Lond. 1880 ff., and Introduction to the Massoretico-critical edition of the Hebr.
Bible, Lond. 1897 (his text, reprinted from that of Jacob b. ?ayyîm [Venice, 1524–5] with
variants from MSS. and the earliest editions, was published in 2 vols. at London in 1894, 2nd
ed. 1906; a revised edition is in progress); H. Hyvernat, ‘La langue et le langage de la
Massore’ (as a mixture of New-Hebrew and Aramaic), in the Revue biblique, Oct. 1903, p.
529 ff. and B: ‘Lexique massorétique, ’ ibid., Oct. 1904, p. 521 ff., 1905, p. 481 ff., and p.
515 ff. In the use of the Massora for the critical construction of the Text, useful work has been
done especially by S. Baer, in the editions of the several books (only Exod.-Deut. have still to
appear), edited from 1869 conjointly with Fr. Delitzsch, and since 1891 by Baer alone. Cf.
also § 7 h.

The various readings of the Qerê (see § 17) form one of the oldest and most important
parts of the Masora. The punctuation of the Text, however, is not to be confounded with the
compilation of the Masora. The former was settled at an earlier period, and is the result of a
much more exhaustive labour than the Masora, which was not completed till a considerably
later time.

3. It was not until about the beginning of the tenth century that the Jews, following

the example of the Arabs, began their grammatical compilations. Of the numerous
grammatical and lexicographical works of R. Sa(cid:31)adya, 1 beyond fragments in the
commentary on the Sepher Ye?ira (ed. Mayer-Lambert, pp. 42, 47, 75, &c.), only the
explanation in Arabic of the seventy (more correctly ninety) hapax legomena in the O.
T. has been preserved. Written likewise in Arabic, but frequently translated into

being an equally legitimate form) is rightly rejected by König, l. c. The Correctness of
the form ???????? (by the side of the equally well-attested form ???????) does not seem to
us to be invalidated by his arguments, nor by Blau’s proposal to read ??????? (JQR. xii.
241). The remark of Levias (l.c.) deserves notice, that with the earlier Masoretes
????? is equivalent to orthography, i.e. plene- and defective writing, and only later
came to mean traditio.—G. Wildboer, in ZAW. 1909, p. 74, contends that as ??? to
hand on is not found in the O.T., it must be a late denominative in this sense.

Comm. zu den Psalmen4, p. 39.

Hebrew, were the still extant works of the grammarians R. Yehuda ?ayyû? (also
called Abu Zakarya Ya?ya, about the year 1000) and R. Yona (Ahu l-Wal??d Merwân
ibn ?anâ?, about 1030). By the aid of these earlier labours, Abraham ben Ezra
(commonly called Aben Ezra, ob. 1167) and R. David Qim?i (ob. c. 1235) especially
gained a classical reputation by their Hebrew grammatical writings.

From these earliest grammarians are derived many principles of arrangement and
technical terms, some of which are still retained, e.g. the naming of the conjugations and
weak verbs according to the paradigm of ???, certain voces memoriales, as ??????????? and the
like.1

4. The father of Hebrew philology among Christians was John Reuchlin (ob.
1522),2 to whom Greek literature also is so much indebted. Like the grammarians who
succeeded him, till the time of John Buxtorf the elder (ob. 1629), he still adhered
almost entirely to Jewish tradition. From the middle of the seventeenth century the
field of investigation gradually widened, and the study of the kindred languages,
chiefly through the leaders of the Dutch school, Albert Schultens (ob. 1750) and N.
W. Schroöder (ob. 1798), became offruitful service to Hebrew grammar.

5. In the nineteenth century3 the advances in Hebrew philology are especially
connected with the names of W. Gesenius (born at Nordhausen, Feb. 3, 1786; from
the year 1810 Professor at Halle, where he died Oct. 23, 1842), who above all things
aimed at the comprehensive observation and lucid presentation of the actually
occurring linguistic phenomena; H. Ewald (ob. 1875, at Göttingen; Krit. Gramm. der
Hebr. Spr., Lpz. 1827; Ausführl. Lehrb. d. hebr. Spr., 8th ed., Gött. 1870), who
chiefly aimed at referring linguistic forms to general laws and rationally explaining
the latter; J. Olshausen (ob. 1882, at Berlin; Lehrb. der hebr. Sprache, Brunswick,
1861) who attempted a consistent explanation of the existing condition of the
language, from the presupposed primitive Semitic forms, preserved according to him
notably in old Arabic. F. Böttcher (Ausführl. Lehrb. d. hebr. Spr. ed. by F.Mühlau, 2
vols., Lpz. 1866–8) endeavoured to present an exhaustive synopsis of the linguistic
phenomena, as well as to give an explanation of them from the sphere of Hebrew
alone. B. Stade, on the other hand (Lehrb. der hebr. Gr., pt. i. Lpz. 1879), adopted a

printing—the Psalter in 1477, the Bologna Pentateuch in 1482, the Sencino O.T.
complete in 1488: see the description of the twenty-four earliest editions (down to
1528) in Ginsburg’s Introduction, p. 779 ff.

strictly scientific method in endeavouring to reduce the systems of Ewald and
Olshausen to a more fundamental unity. E. König1 in his very thorough researches
into the phonology and accidence starts generally from the position reached by the
early Jewish grammarians (in his second part ‘with comparative reference to the
Semitic languages in general’) and instead of adopting the usual dogmatic method,
takes pains to re-open the discussion of disputed grammatical questions. The syntax
König has ‘endeavoured to treat in several respects in such a way as to show its
affinity to the common Semitic syntax’.—Among the works of Jewish scholars,
special attention may be called to the grammar by S. D. Luzzatto written in Italian
(Padua, 1853–69).

The chief requirements for one who is treating the grammar of an ancient
language are—(1) that he should observe as fully and accurately as possible the
existing linguistic phenomena and describe them, after showing their organic
connexion (the empirical and historico-critical element); (2) that he should try to
explain these facts, partly by comparing them with one another and by the analogy of
the sister languages, partly from the general laws of philology (the logical element).

Such observation has more and more led to the belief that the original text of the

O. T. has suffered to a much greater extent than former scholars were inclined to
admit, in spite of the number of variants in parallel passages: Is 2:2 ff. = Mi 4:1 ff., Is
36–39 = 2 K 18:13–2019, Jer 52 = 2 K 24:18–2530, 2 S 22 = Ps 18, Ps 14 = Ps 53, Ps
40:14 ff. = Ps 70, Ps 108 = Ps 57:8 ff. and 60:7 ff.. Cf. also the parallels between the
Chronicles and the older historical books, and F. Vodel, Die konsonant. Varianten in
den doppelt überlief. poet. Stücken d. masoret. Textes, Lpz. 1905. As to the extent and
causes of the corruption of the Masoretic text, the newly discovered fragments of the
Hebrew Ecclesiasticus are very instructive; cf. Smend, Gött. gel. Anz., 1906, p. 763.

The causes of unintentional corruption in the great majority of cases are:—

Interchange of similar letters, which has sometimes taken place in the early
‘Phoenician’ writing; transposition or omission of single letters, words, or even whole
sentences, which are then often added in the margin and thence brought back into the
text in the wrong place; such omission is generally due to homoioteleuton (cf.
Ginsburg, Introd., p. 171 ff.), i. e. the scribe’s eye wanders from the place to a
subsequent word of the same or similar form. Other causes are dittography, i. e.
erroneous repetition of letters, words, and even sentences; its opposite, haplography;
and lastly wrong division of words (cf. Ginsburg, Introd., p. 158 ff.), since at a certain
period in the transmission of the text the words were not separated.1—Intentional
changes are due to corrections for the sake of decency or of dogma, and to the
insertion of glosses, some of them very early.

1 1 This scriptio continua is also found in Phoenician inscriptions. The inscription of
Mêša(cid:31) always divides the words by a point (and so the Siloam inscription; see the
facsimile at the beginning of this grammar), and frequently marks the close of a
sentence by a stroke.

Advance in grammar is therefore closely dependent on progress in textual
criticism. The systematic pursuit of the latter has only begun in recent years: cf.
especially Doorninck on Ju 1–16, Leid. 1879; Wellhausen, Text der Bb. Sam., Gött.

§ 4. Division and Arrangement of the Grammar.

The division and arrangement of Hebrew grammar follow the three constituent
parts of every language, viz. (1) articulate sounds represented by letters, and united to
form syllables, (2) words, and (3) sentences.

The first part (the elements) comprises accordingly the treatment of sounds and
their representation in writing. It describes the nature and relations of the sounds of
the language, teaches the pronunciation of the written signs (orthoepy), and the
established mode of writing (orthography). It then treats of the sounds as combined in
syllables and words, and specifies the laws and conditions under which this
combination takes place.

The second part (etymology) treats of words in their character as parts of speech,
and comprises: (1) the principles of the formation of words, or of the derivation of the
different parts of speech from the roots or from one another; (2) the principles of
inflexion, i. e. of the various forms which the words assume according to their relation
to other words and to the sentence.

The third part (syntax, or the arrangement of words): (1) shows how the word-
formations and inflexions occurring in the language are used to express different
shades of ideas, and how other ideas, for which the language has not coined any
forms, are expressed by periphrasis; (2) states the laws according to which the parts of
speech are combined in sentences (the principles of the sentence, or syntax in the
stricter sense of the term).

Petersburg, 1882; also Lidzbarski’s in the Jewish Encycl., see above.

1. The Hebrew letters now in use, in which both the manuscripts of the O. T. are

written and our editions of the Bible are printed, commonly called the square
character (??????? ?????), also the Assyrian character (??????? ???),1 are not those originally
employed.

1 1 The name ????? (Assyria) is here used in the widest sense, to include the countries
on the Mediterranean inhabited by Aramaeans; cf. Stade in ZAW. 1882, p. 292 f. On
some other names for Old Hebrew writing, cf. G. Hoffmann, ibid. 1881, p. 334 ff.;
Buhl, Canon and Text of the O. T. (transl. by J. Macpherson), Edinb. 1892, p. 200.

Old Hebrew (or Old Canaanitish 2) writing, as it was used on public monuments
in the beginning of the ninth and in the second half of the eighth century B.C., is to be
seen in the inscription of Mêša&#62, as well as in that of Siloam. The characters on
the Maccabaean coins of the second century B.C., and also on ancient gems, still bear
much resemblance to this (cf. § 2 d). With the Old Hebrew writing the Phoenician is
nearly identical (see § 1 k, § 2 f, and the Table of Alphabets). From the analogy of the
history of other kinds of writing, it may be assumed that out of and along with this
monumental character, a less antique and in some ways more convenient, rounded
style was early developed, for use on softer materials, skins, bark, papyrus, and the
like. This the Samaritans retained after their separation from the Jews, while the Jews
gradually1 (between the sixth and the fourth century) exchanged it for an Aramaic
character. From this gradually arose (from about the fourth to the middle of the third
century) what is called the square character, which consequently bears great
resemblance to the extant forms of Aramaic writing, such as the Egyptian-Aramaic,
the Nabatean and especially the Palmyrene. Of Hebrew inscriptions in the older
square character, that of Arâq al-Em??r (15 ½ miles north-east of the mouth of the
Jordan) probably belongs to 183 B.C.2

The Jewish sarcophagus-inscriptions of the time of Christ, found in Jerusalem in 1905,
almost without exception exhibit a pure square character. This altered little in the course of
centuries, so that the age of a Hebrew MS. cannot easily be determined from the style of the
writing. The oldest known biblical fragment is the Nash papyrus (found in 1902), containing
the ten commandments and the beginning of Dt 6:4 f., of the end of the first or beginning of
the second century A.D.; cf. N. Peters, Die älteste Abschr. der 10 Gebote, Freibg. i. B. 1905.
Of actual MSS. of the Bible the oldest is probably one of 820–850 A.D. described by
Ginsburg, Introd., p. 469 ff., at the head of his sixty principal MSS.; next in age is the codex
of Moses ben Asher at Cairo (897 A.D., cf. the art. ‘Scribes’ in the Jew. Encycl. xi and
Gottheil in JQR. 1905, p. 32). The date (916 A.D.) of the Codex prophetarum Babylon.
Petropol. (see § 8 g, note) is quite certain.—In the synagogue-rolls a distinction is drawn
between the Tam-character (said to be so called from Rabbi Tam, grandson of R. Yi???q??, in
the twelfth century) with its straight strokes, square corners and ‘tittles’ (t?g??n), in German
and Polish MSS., and the foreign character with rounded letters and tittles in Spanish MSS.
See further E. König, Einl. in das A. T., Bonn, 1893, p. 16 ff.

2. The Alphabet consists, like all Semitic alphabets, solely of consonants, twenty-

two in number, some of which, however, have also a kind of vocalic power (§ 7 b).
The following Table shows their form, names, pronunciation, and numerical value
(see k):—

2 2 It is tacitly assumed here that this was the mother of all Semitic alphabets. In
ZDMG. 1909, p. 189 ff., however, Prätorius has shown good grounds for believing
that the South Semitic alphabet is derived not from the Mêša character, or from some
kindred and hardly older script, but from some unknown and much earlier form of
writing.
1 1 On the effect of the transitional mixture of earlier and later forms on the
constitution of the text, see R. Kittel, Ueber d. Notwendigk. d. Herausg. einer neuen
hebr. Bibel, Lpz. 1901, p. 20 ff.—L. Blau, ‘Wie lange stand die althebr. Schrift bet
den Juden im Gebrauch?’ in Kaufmanngedenkbuch, Breslau, 1900, p. 44 ff.
2 2 Not 176, as formerly held. Driver and Lidzbarski now read ?????, correctly, not
?????.

3. As the Table shows, five letters have a special form at the end of the word.
They are called final letters, and were combined by the Jewish grammarians in the
mnemonic word ????????? Kamnèphä?, or better, with A. Müller and Stade, ????????? i. e. as
the breaker in pieces.1 Of these, ?, ?, ?, ? are distinguished from the common form by

1 1 Philippi, ‘Die Aussprache der semit. Consonanten ? und ?, ’ in ZDMG. 1886, p.
639 ff., 1897, p. 66 ff., adduces reasons in detail for the opinion that ‘the Semitic ? and
? are certainly by usage consonants, although by nature they are vowels, viz. u and i,
and consequently are consonantal vowels’; cf. § 8 m.
2 2 As a representation of this sound the Latin q is very suitable, since it occupies in
the alphabet the place of the Semitic ? (Greek ?????).
3 3 Nestle (Actes du onzième Congrès … des Orientalistes, 1897, iv. 113 ff.) has
shown that the original order was ?, ?.
1 1 In the Talmud, disregarding the alphabetical order, ??????????? of thy watcher, i. e.
prophet. See the discussions of this mnemonic word by Nestle, ZAW. 1907, p. 119 ff.,
König, Bacher (who would read ???????????? = proceeding from thy prophets, Is 52:8),

the shaft being drawn straight down, while in the usual form it is bent round towards
the left.2 In the case of ? the letter is completely closed.

4. Hebrew is read and written from right to left.3 Words must not be divided at the

end of the lines;4 but, in order that no empty space may be left, in MSS. and printed
texts, certain letters suitable for the purpose are dilated at the end or in the middle of
the line. In our printed texts these literae dilatabiles are the five following: ? ? ? ?
? (mnemonic word ????????? ahaltèm). In some MSS. other letters suitable for the
purpose are also employed in this way, as ?, ?  , ?; cf. Strack in the Theol. Lehrb., 1882,
No. 22; Nestle, ZAW. 1906, p. 170 f.

Rem. 1. The forms of the letters originally represent the rude outlines of perceptible
objects, the names of which, respectively, begin with the consonant represented (akrophony).
Thus Yôd, in the earlier alphabets the rude picture of a hand, properly denotes hand (Heb. ???),
but as a letter simply the sound ? (y), with which this word begins; Ay??n, originally a circle,
properly an eye (
????? ), stands for the consonant ?. In the Phoenician alphabet, especially, the
resemblance of the forms to the objects denoted by the name is still for the most part
recognizable (see the Table). In some letters (?, ?, ?, ?, ?) the similarity is still preserved in the
square character.

It is another question whether the present names are all original. They may be merely due
to a later, and not always accurate, interpretation of the forms. Moreover, it is possible that in
the period from about 1500 to 1000 B.C. the original forms underwent considerable change.

The usual explanation of the present names of the letters5 is: ???? ox, ???? house, ????? camel

(according to Lidzbarski, see below, perhaps originally ??????? axe or pick-axe), ????? door

Krauss, Marmorstein, ibid. p. 278 ff. All the twenty-two letters, together with the five
final forms, occur in Zp 3:8.
2 2 Chwolson, Corpus Inscr. Hebr., col. 68, rightly observes that the more original
forms of these letters are preserved in the literae finales. Instances of them go back to
the time of Christ.
3 3 The same was originally the practice in Greek, which only adopted the opposite
direction exclusively about 400 B.C. On the boustroph?don writing (alternately in
each direction) in early Greek, early Sabaean, and in the Safa-inscriptions of the first
three centuries A.D., cf. Lidzbarski, Ephemeris, i. 116 f.
4 4 This does not apply to early inscriptions or seals. Cf. Mêša, II. 1–5, 7, 8, &c.,
Siloam 2, 3, 5, where the division of words appears to be customary.
ZAW. ZAW, = Zeitschrift für die alttestamentliche Wissenschaft, ed. by B. Stade,
Giessen, 1881 ff., and since 1907 by K. Marti.
5 5 We possess Greek transcriptions of the Hebrew names, dating from the fifth
century B.C. The LXX give them (in almost the same form as Eusebius, Praep. Evang.
10. 5) in La 1–4, as do also many Codices of the Vulgate (e.g. the Cod. Amiatinus) in
?? 111, 112, 119, but with many variations from the customary forms, which rest on
the traditional Jewish pronunciation. The forms Deleth (and delth), Zai, Sen (LXX
also ????, cf. Hebr. ? ?? tooth) are to be noticed, amongst others, for Daleth, Zain,
Š?(cid:31)n. Cf. the tables in Nöldeke, Beiträge zur sem. Sprachwiss., p. 126 f. In his
opinion (and so Lidzbarski, Ephemeris, i. 134) the form and meaning of the names
point to Phoenicia as the original home of the alphabet, since alf, bêt, dalt, w?w, t?w,
pei = pê, p?(cid:31), mouth, and the vowel of ?? = r?š, head, are all Hebraeo-Phoenician.

?????  olive-tree), ???? fence, barrier (but perhaps only differentiated from ? by the left-

(properly folding door; according to Lidzbarski, perhaps ??? the female breast), ??? air-hole (?),
lattice-window (?), ??? hook, nail, ????? weapon (according to Nestle, comparing the Greek ????,
rather
hand stroke), ???? a winding (?), according to others a leather bottle or a snake (but perhaps
only differentiated from ? by a circle round it), ??? hand, ??? bent hand, ????? ox-goad, ????? water,
??? fish (Lidzbarski, ‘perhaps originally ????? snake,’ as in Ethiopic), ?????? prop (perhaps a
modification of ?), ????? eye, ??? (also ???) mouth, ????? fish-hook (?), ??? eye of a needle, according
to others back of the head (Lidzb., ‘perhaps ? ???? bow’), ???? head, ?? ?? tooth, ??? sign, cross.

With regard to the origin of this alphabet, it may be taken as proved that it is not earlier
(or very little earlier) than the fifteenth century B.C., since otherwise the el-Amarna tablets (§
2 f) would not have been written exclusively in cuneiform.1 It seems equally certain on
various grounds, that it originated on Canaanitish soil. It is, however, still an open question
whether the inventors of it borrowed

(a) From the Egyptian system—not, as was formerly supposed, by direct adoption of
hieroglyphic signs (an explanation of twelve or thirteen characters was revived by J. Halévy
in Rev. Sémit. 1901, p. 356 ff., 1902, p. 331 ff., and in the Verhandlungen des xiii. … Orient.-
Kongr. zu Hamb., Leiden, 1904, p. 199 ff.; but cf. Lidzbarski, Ephemeris, i. 261 ff.), or of
hieratic characters derived from them (so E. de Rougé), but by the adoption of the acrophonic
principle (see e) by which e.g. the hand, in Egyptian tot, represents the letter t, the lion =
laboi, the letter l. This view still seems the most probable. It is now accepted by Lidzbarski
(‘Der Ursprung d. nord- u. südsemit. Schrift’ in Ephemeris, i (1900), 109 ff., cf. pp. 134 and
261 ff.), though in his Nordsem. Epigr. (1898) p. 173 ff. he was still undecided.

(b) From the Babylonian (cuneiform) system. Wuttke’s and W. Deecke’s derivation of the

old-Semitic alphabet from new-Assyrian cuneiform is impossible for chronological reasons.
More recently Peters and Hommel have sought to derive it from the old-Babylonian, and Ball
from the archaic Assyrian cuneiform. A vigorous discussion has been aroused by the theory
of Frdr. Delitzsch (in Die Entstehung des ält. Schriftsystems od. der Urspr. der
Keilschriftzeichen dargel., Lpz. 1897; and with the same title ‘Ein Nachwort’, Lpz. 1898,
preceded by a very clear outline of the theory) that the old-Semitic alphabet arose in Canaan
under the influence both of the Egyptian system (whence the acrophonic principle) and of the
old-Babylonian, whence the principle of the graphic representation of objects and ideas by
means of simple, and mostly rectilinear, signs. He holds that the choice of the objects was
probably (in about fifteen cases) influenced by the Babylonian system. The correspondence of
names had all the more effect since, according to Zimmern (ZDMG. 1896, p. 667 ff.), out of
twelve names which are certainly identical, eight appear in the same order in the Babylonian
arrangement of signs. But it must first be shown that the present names of the ‘Phoenician’
letters really denote the original picture. The identity of the objects may perhaps be due
simply to the choice of the commonest things (animals, implements, limbs) in both systems.

The derivation of the Semitic alphabet from the signs of the Zodiac and their names, first

attempted by Seyffarth in 1834, has been revived by Winckler, who refers twelve
fundamental sounds to the Babylonian Zodiac. Hommel connects the original alphabet with
the moon and its phases, and certain constellations; cf. Lidzbarski, Ephemeris, i. 269 ff., and
in complete agreement with him, Benzinger, Hebr. Archäologie2, p. 173 ff. This theory is by
no means convincing.

1 1 In the excavations at Jericho in April, 1907, E. Sellin found a jar-handle with the
Canaanite characters ?? which he dates (probably too early) about 1500 B.C..
ZDMG. ZDMG. = Zeitschrift der deutschen morgenländischen Gesellschaft, Lpz.
1846 ff., since 1903 ed. by A. Fischer.

(c) From the hieroglyphic system of writing discovered in 1894 by A. J. Evans in

inscriptions in Crete (esp. at Cnossus) and elsewhere. According to Kluge (1897) and others,
this represents the ‘Mycenaean script’ used about 3000–1000 b.c., and according to Fries (‘Die
neuesten Forschungen über d. Urspr. des phöniz. Alph.’ in ZDPV. xxii. 118 ff.) really supplies
the original forms of the Phoenician alphabet as brought to Palestine by the Philistines about
1100 B.C., but ‘the Phoenician-Canaanite-Hebrews gave to the Mycenaean signs names
derived from the earlier cuneiform signs’. The hypothesis of Fries is thus connected With that
of Delitzsch. But although the derivation of the Phoenician forms from ‘Mycenaean’ types
appears in some cases very plausible, in ethers there are grave difficulties, and moreover the
date, 1100 B.C., assigned for the introduction of the alphabet is clearly too late. [See Evans,
Scripta Minoa, Oxf. 1909, p. 80 ff.]

(d) From a system, derived from Asia Minor, closely related to the Cypriote syllabary
(Praetorius, Der Urspr. des kanaan. Alphabets, Berlin, 1906). On this theory the Canaanites
transformed the syllabic into an apparently alphabetic writing. In reality, however, they
merely retained a single sign for the various syllables, so that e.g. ? is not really q, but qa, qe,
qi, &c. Of the five Cypriote vowels also they retained only the star (in Cypriote = a)
simplified into an ?lef (see alphabetical table) to express the vowels at the beginning of
syllables, and i and u as Yod and Waw. Praetorius claims to explain about half the twenty-two
Canaanite letters in this way, but there are various objections to his ingenious hypothesis.

2. As to the order of the letters, we possess early evidence in the alphabetic1 poems: Ps 9
(?–?  , cf. Ps 10:1 ?, and vv12–17 ?–?; cf. Gray in the Expositor, 1906, p. 233 ff., and Rosenthal,
ZAW. 1896, p. 40, who shows that Ps 9:3, 15, 17 ?  , ?, ? , exactly fit in between ?, ?, ?, and that
Ps 10:1, 3, 5 therefore has the reverse order ?, ?, ?); also ?? 25 and 34 (both without a
separate ?-verse and with ? repeated at the end2); 37, 111, 112, 119 (in which every eight
verses begin with the same letter, each strophe, as discovered by D. H. Müller of Vienna,
containing the eight leading words of Ps 19:8 ff., tôr?, edûth, &c.); La 1–4 (in 2–4 ? before ?3,
in chap. 3 every three verses with the same initial, see Löhr, ZAW. 1904, p. 1 ff., in chap. 5 at
any rate as many verses as letters in the alphabet); Pr 24:1, 3, 5, 31:10–31 (in the LXX with ?
before ?3); also in Na 1:2–10 Pastor Frohnmeyer of Württemberg (ob. 1880) detected traces of
an alphabetic arrangement, but the attempt of Gunkel, Bickell, Arnold (ZAW. 1901, p. 225
ff.), Happel (Der Ps. Nah, Würzb. 1900) to discover further traces, has not been successful.
[Cf. Gray in Expositor, 1898, p. 207 ff.; Driver, in the Century Bible, Nahum, p. 26.]—
Bickell, Ztschr f. Kath. Theol., 1882, p. 319 ff., had already deduced from the versions the
alphabetical character of Ecclus 51:13–30, with the omission of the ?-verse and with ?1 at the
end. His conjectures have been brilliantly confirmed by the discovery of the Hebrew original,
although the order from ? to ? is partly disturbed or obscured. If ? before ? is deleted, ten
letters are in their right positions, and seven can be restored to their places with certainty. Cf.

ZDPV. ZDPV. = Zeitschrift des deutschen Palästinavereins, Lpz. 1878 ff., since 1903
ed. by C. Steuernagel.
1 1 On the supposed connexion of this artificial arrangement with magical formulae
(‘the order of the letters was believed to have a sort of magic power’) cf. Löhr, ZAW.
1905, p. 173 ff., and Klagelieder2, Gött. 1907, p. vii ff.
2 2 On this superfluous ? cf. Grimme, Euphemistic liturgical appendices, Lpz. 1901,
p. 8 ff., and Nestle, ZAW. 1903, p. 340 f., who considers it an appendage to the Greek
alphabet.
3 3 [Perhaps also originally in Ps 34.] ? before ? is probably due to a magic alphabet,
see above, n. 1. According to Böhmer, ZAW. 1908, p. 53 ff., the combinations ??, ??,
??, &c., were used in magical texts; ?? was excluded, but by a rearrangement we get
?? and ??.

Wisdom of Ben Sira, Cambr. 1899, p. lxxvi ff., and in the Journ. of Philol., xxx (1906), p. 95
ff.; JQR. 1905, p. 238 ff.; Löhr, ZAW. 1905, p. 183 ff.; I. Lévy, REJ. 1907, p. 62 ff.

The sequence of the three softest labial, palatal, and dental sounds ?, ?, ?, and of the three
liquids ?, ?  , ? , indicates an attempt at classification. At the same time other considerations also
appear to have had influence. Thus it is certainly not accidental, that two letters, representing
a hand (Yôd, Kaph), as also two (if Qôph = back of the head) which represent the head, and in
general several forms denoting objects naturally connected (Mêm and Nûn, Ay??n and Pê),
stand next to one another.

The order, names, and numerical values of the letters have passed over from the

Phoenicians to the Greeks, in whose alphabet the letters ? to ? are borrowed from the Old
Semitic. So also the Old Italic alphabets as well as the Roman, and consequently all alphabets
derived either from this or from the Greek, are directly or indirectly dependent on the
Phoenician.

3. a. In default of special arithmetical figures, the consonants were used also as numerical

signs; cf. G. Gundermann, Die Zahlzeichen, Giessen, 1899, p. 6 f., and Lidzbarski,
Ephemeris, i. 106 ff. The earliest traces of this usage are, however, first found on the
Maccabean coins (see above, § 2 d, end). These numerical letters were afterwards commonly
employed, e.g. for marking the numbers of chapters and verses in the editions of the Bible.
The units are denoted by ?–?, the tens by ?–?  , 100–400 by ?–?, the numbers from 500–900 by
? (=400), with the addition of the remaining hundreds, e.g. ?? 500. In compound numbers the
greater precedes (on the right), thus ?? 11, ??? 121. But 15 is expressed by ?? 9+6, not ??
(which is a form of the divine name, being the first two consonants of ????).2 For a similar
reason ?? is also mostly written for 16, instead of ??, which in compound proper names, like
?????, also represents the name of God, ????.

The thousands are sometimes denoted by the units with two dots placed above, e.g.  ???

1000.

b. The reckoning of the years in Jewish writings (generally ?????? after the creation)
follows either the full chronology (????? ??????? or ?? ???), with the addition of the thousands, or
the abridged chronology (????? ???), in which they are omitted. In the dates of the first thousand
years after Christ, the Christian era is obtained by the addition of 240, in the second thousand
years by the addition of 1240 (i. e. if the date falls between Jan. 1 and the Jewish new year;
otherwise add 1239), the thousands of the Creation era being omitted.

4. Abbreviations of words are not found in the text of the O. T., but they occur on coins,

and their use is extremely frequent amongst the later Jews.3 A point, or later an oblique
stroke, serves as the sign of abridgement in old MSS. and editions, e.g. ??? for ????? ????, ?? for
??????? aliquis, ?? for ????? aliquid, ???? for ??????? et complens, i. e. and so on. Also in the middle of
what is apparently a word, such strokes indicate that it is an abbreviation or a vox memorialis
(cf. e.g. § 15 d ????). Two such strokes are employed, from § 41 d onward, to mark the
different classes of weak verbs.—Note also ???? or ??? (also ??) for ???????.

REJ. REJ. = Revue des Études Juives. Paris, 1880 ff.
2 2 On the rise of this custom (?? having been originally used and afterwards ??), cf.
Nestle in ZAW. 1884, p. 250, where a trace of this method of writing occurring as
early as Origen is noted.
3 3 Cf. Jo. Buxtorf, De abbreviaturis Hebr., Basel, 1613, &c.; Pietro Perreau.

5. Peculiarities in the tradition of the O. T. text, which are already mentioned in the

Talmud, are—(1) The 15 puncta extraordinaria, about which the tradition (from Siphri on Nu
9:10 onwards) differs considerably, even as to their number; on particular consonants, Gn
16:5, 18:9, 19:33, 35, Nu 9:10; or on whole words, Gn 33:4, 37:12, Nu 3:39, 21:30, 29:15, Dt
29:28, 2 S 19:20, Is 44:9, Ez 41:20, 46:22, Ps 27:13, —all no doubt critical marks; cf. Strack,
Prolegomena Critica, p. 88 ff.; L. Blau, Masoretische Untersuchungen, Strassburg, 1891, p. 6
ff., and Einleitung in die hl. Schrift, Budapest, 1894; Königsberger, Juüd. Lit.-Blatt, 1891,
nos. 29–31, and Aus Masorah u. Talmudkritik, Berlin, 1892, p. 6 ff.; Mayer-Lambert, REJ. 30
(1895), no. 59; and especially Ginsburg, Introd., p. 318 ff.; also on the ten points found in the
Pentateuch, see Butin (Baltimore, 1906), who considers that they are as old as the Christian
era and probably mark a letter, &c., to be deleted. (2) The literae majusculae (e.g. ? Gn 1:1, ?
Lv 11:42 as the middle consonant of the Pentateuch, ? Nu 14:17), and minusculae (e.g. ? Gn
2:4). (3) The literae suspensae (Ginsburg, Introd., p. 334 ff.) ?  Ju 18:30 (which points to the
reading ? ??? for ????????, ? Ps 80:14 (the middle of the Psalms1) and Jb 38:13, 15. (4) The
‘mutilated’ W?w in ???? Nu 25:12, and ? Ex 32:25 (??????), and Nu 7:2 (???????). (5) Mêm
clausum in ????? Is 9:6, and Mêm apertum in
 Neh 2:13. (6) Nûn inversum before Nu
10:35, and after ver. 36, as also before Ps 107:23–28 and 40; according to Ginsburg, Introd., p.
341 ff., a sort of bracket to indicate that the verses are out of place; cf. Krauss, ZAW. 1902, p.
57 ff., who regards the inverted Nûns as an imitation of the Greek obelus.

§ 6. Pronunciation and Division of Consonants.

P. Haupt, ‘Die Semit. Sprachlaute u. ihre Umschrift, ’ in Beiträge zur Assyriologie u.
vergleich. semit. Sprachwissenschaft, by Delitzsch and Haupt, i, Lpz. 1889, 249 ff.; E.
Sievers, Metrische Studien, i, Lpz. 1901, p. 14 ff.

1. An accurate knowledge of the original phonetic value of each consonant is of
the greatest importance, since very many grammatical peculiarities and changes (§ 18
ff.) only become intelligible from the nature and pronunciation of the sounds. This
knowledge is obtained partly from the pronunciation of the kindred dialects,
especially the still living Arabic, partly by observing the affinity and interchange of
sounds on Hebrew itself (§ 19), and partly from the tradition of the Jews.1

The pronunciation of Hebrew by the modern German Jews, which partly resembles the

Syriac and is generally called ‘Polish’, differs considerably from that of the Spanish and
Portuguese Jews, which approaches nearer to the Arabic. The pronunciation of Hebrew by
Christians follows the latter (after the example of Reuchlin), in almost all cases.

The oldest tradition is presented in the transcription of Hebrew names in Assyrian

cuneiform; a later, but yet in its way very important system is seen in the manner in which the
LXX transcribe Hebrew names with Greek letters.2 As, however, corresponding signs for
several sounds (?, ?, ?  , ?, ?) are wanting in the Greek alphabet, only an approximate

1 1 According to Blau, Studien zum althebr. Buchwesen, Strassburg, 1902, p. 167,
properly a large ?, called tlûy? because suspended between the two halves of the
Psalter, and then incorrectly taken for a littera suspensa.
1 1 Cf. C. Meinhof, “Die Aussprache des Hebr., ” in Neue Jahrb. f. Philol. u. Pädag.,
1885, Bd. 132, p. 146 ff.; M. Schreiner, ‘Zur Gesch. der Ausspr. des Hebr., ’ in ZAW.
1886, p. 213 ff.
2 2 Cf. Frankel, Vorstudien zu der Septuag., Lpz. 1841, p. 90 ff.; C. Könneke,

palimpsest fragment of the Hexapla at Milan, see Mercati, Atti della R. Accad., xxxi,
Turin, 1896. [Cf. Burkitt, Fragments of … Aquila, Cambr. 1897, p. 13.]

representation was possible in these cases. The same applies to the Latin transcription of
Hebrew words by Jerome, according to the Jewish pronunciation of his time.3

On the pronunciation of the modern Jews in North Africa, see Bargeès in the Journ.
Asiat., Nov. 1848; on that of the South Arabian Jews, J. Dérenbourg, Manuel du lecteur, &c.
(from a Yemen MS. of the year 1390), Paris, 1871 (extrait 6 du Journ. Asiat. 1870).

2.With regard to the pronunciation of the several gutturals and sibilants, and of ?

and ?, it may be remarked:—

I. Among the gutturals, the glottal stop ? is the lightest, corresponding to the spiritus lenis

of the Greeks. It may stand either at the beginning or end of a syllable, e.g. ???? ?már, ? ??????
yäšám. Even before a vowel ? is almost lost to our ear, like the h in hour and in the French
habit, homme. After a vowel ? generally (and at the end of a word, always) coalesces with it,
e.g. ????? q?r? for an original q?r?, Arab. q?r??; see further, § 23 a, 27 g.

? before a vowel corresponds exactly to our h (spiritus asper); after a vowel it is either a
guttural (so always at the end of a syllable which is not final, e.g. ???????? nähpakh; at the end of
a word the consonantal ? has a point—Mapp??q—in it, see § 14), or it stands inaudible at the
end of a word, generally as a mere orthographic indication of a preceding vowel, e.g. ?????
g?l?; cf. §§ 7 b and 75 a.

? is related to ?, but is a much stronger guttural. Its strongest sound is a rattled, guttural g,

cf. e.g. ?????, LXX ????, ??????? ??µ????; elsewhere, a weaker sound of the same kind, which
the LXX reproduce by a spiritus (lenis or asper), e.g. ????? ???, ??????? ?µ????.4 In the mouth of
the Arabs one hears in the former case a sort of guttural r, in the latter a sound peculiar to
themselves formed in the back of the throat.—It is as incorrect to omit the ? entirely, in
reading and transcribing words (????? Eli, ??????? Amalek), as to pronounce it exactly like g or like
a nasal ng. The stronger sound might be approximately transcribed by gh or rg; but since in
Hebrew the softer sound was the more common, it is sufficient to represent it by the sign , as
?????? arba, ??? ad.

? is the strongest guttural sound, a deep guttural ch, as heard generally in Swiss German,
somewhat as in the German Achat, Macht, Sache, Docht, Zucht (not as in Licht, Knecht), and
similar to the Spanish j. Like ? it was, however, pronounced in many words feebly, in others
strongly.

As regards ?, its pronunciation as a palatal (with a vibrating uvula) seems to have been

the prevailing one. Hence in some respects it is also classed with the gutturals (§ 22 q r). On
the lingual ?, cf. o.

3 3 Numerous examples occur in Hieronymi quaestiones hebraicae in libro geneseos,
edited by P. de Lagarde, Lpz. 1868; cf. the exhaustive and systematic discussion by
Siegfried,‘Die Aussprache des Hebr. bei Hieronymus, ’ in ZAW. 1884, pp. 34–83.
4 4 It is, however, doubtful if the LXX always consciously aimed at reproducing the
actual differences of sound.

2. The Hebrew language is unusually rich in sibilants. These have, at any rate in some

cases, arisen from dentals which are retained as such in Aramaic and Arabic (see in the
Lexicon. the letters ?, ? and ?).

? and ? were originally represented (as is still the case in the unpointed texts) by only one

form ?; but that the use of this one form to express two different sounds (at least in Hebrew)
was due only to the poverty of the alphabet, is clear from the fact that they are differentiated
in Arabic and Ethiopic (cf. Nöldeke in Ztschr. f. wissensch. Theol., 1873, p. 121;
Brockelmann, Grundriss, i. 133). In the Masoretic punctuation they were distinguished by
means of the diacritical point as ? (sh) and ? (?).1

The original difference between the sounds ? and ?2 sometimes marks a distinction in
meaning, e.g. ????? to close, ??? ?? to hire, ????? to be foolish, ??? ?? to be prudent, to be wise. Syriac
always represents both sounds by ?, and in Hebrew also they are sometimes interchanged ; as
?????  for ??? ?? to hire, Ezr 4:5; ????? ?? for ??????? folly, Ec 1:17.

? (transcribed ? by the LXX) is a soft whizzing s, the French and English z, altogether

different from the German z (ts).

3. ?, ?  , and probably ? are pronounced with a strong articulation and with a compression

of the larynx. The first two are thus essentially different from ? and ?, which correspond to
our t and k and also are often aspirated (see below, n). ? is distinguished from every other s by
its peculiar articulation, and in no way corresponds to the German z or ts; we transcribe it by
?; cf. G. Hüsing, ‘Zum Lautwerte des ?, ’ in OLZ. x. 467 ff.

3. Six consonants, the weak and middle hard Palatals, Dentals, and Labials

 ? ?

? ? ? ?

 (???????????)

have a twofold pronunciation, (1) a harder sound, as mutes, like k, p, t, or initial b, g
(hard), d; and (2) a softer sound as spirantes.1 The harder sound is the original. It is
retained at the beginning of syllables, when there is no vowel immediately preceding
to influence the pronunciation, and is denoted by a point, Dageš lene (§ 13), placed in
the consonants, viz. ? b, ? g, ? d, ?   k, ? p, ? t. The weaker pronunciation appears as
soon as a vowel sound immediately precedes. It is occasionally denoted, esp. in MSS.,
by R?phè (§ 14 e), but in printed texts usually by the mere absence of the Dageš. In

Lexicon. Lexicon = A Hebrew and English Lexicon of the Old Testament, based on
the Thesaurus and Lexicon of Gesenius, by F. Brown, S. R. Driver, and C. A. Britts,
Oxford, 1906.
1 1 The modern Samaritans, however, in reading their Hebrew Pentateuch pronounce
? invariably as ?.
2 2 The original value of ?, and its relation to the original value of ? and ?, is still
undetermined, despite the valuable investigations of P. Haupt, ZDMG. 1880, p. 762 f.;
D. H. Müller, ‘Zur Geschichte der semit. Zischlaute, ’ in the Verhandlungen des
Wiener Orient. Congresses, Vienna, 1888, Semitic section, p. 229 ff.; De Lagarde,
‘Samech,’ in the NGGW. 1891, no. 5, esp. p. 173; Aug. Müller, ZAW. 1891, p. 257
ff.; Nöldeke, ZDMG. 1893, p. 100 f.; E. Glaser, Zwei Wiener Publicationen über
Habaschitisch-punische Dialekte in Südarabien, Munich, 1902, pp. 19 ff.—On the
phonetic value of ?   see G. Hüsing, OLZ.. 1907, p. 467 ff.
OLZ. OLZ.Orientalistische Literaturzeitung. Vienna, 1898 ff.
1 1So at any rate at the time when the present punctuation arose.

the case of ?, ?  , ?, ?, the two sounds are clearly distinguishable even to our ear as b
and v, k and German (weak) ch, p and ph, t and th (in thin). The Greeks too express
this twofold pronunciation by special characters: ? ?, ?   ?; ? ?, ? ?; ? ?, ? ?. In the same
way ? should be pronounced like the North German g in Tage, Wagen, and ? like th in
the, as distinguished from ? and ?.

For more precise information on the cases in which the one or the other pronunciation
takes place, see § 21. The modern Jews pronounce the aspirated ? as v, the aspirated ? as s,
e.g. ??? rav (or even raf), ????? bais. The customary transcription (used also in this Grammar) of
the spirants ?, ?  , ? by bh, kh, th is only an unsatisfactory makeshift, since it may lead (esp. in
the case of bh and kh) to an erroneous conception of the sounds as real aspirates, b–h, k–h.

4. According to their special character the consonants are divided into—

(a) Gutturals
(b) Palatals
(c) Dentals
(d) Labials
(e) Sibilants
(f) Sonants

? ? ? ?;
;
? ? ?
? ? ?;
? ?;
;
? ? ? ? ?
.
? ?, ? ?,  ? ?

In the case of ? its hardest pronunciation as a palatal (see above, g, end) is to be
distinguished from its more unusual sound as a lingual, pronounced in the front of the
mouth.

On the twofold pronunciation of r in Tiberias, cf. Delitzsch, Physiol. und Musik, Lpz.
1868, p. 10 ff.; Baer and Struck, Dikduke ha-teamim, Lpz. 1879, p. 5, note a, and § 7 of the
Hebrew text, as well as p. 82.

In accordance with E. Sievers, Metrische Studien, i. 14, the following scheme of

the Hebrew phonetic system is substituted for the table formerly given in this
gramar:—

i. Throat sounds (Gutturals): ? ? ? ?.

ii. Mouth-
sounds:

1. Mutes
and
Spirants:

w.

Palatal ?

m.

Dental ?
Labial ?

2.Sibilants:
3.Sonants:

?

Rem. 1. The meaning of the letters at the top is, w. = weak, m. = middle hard, e. =

emphatic. Consonants which are produced by the same organ of speech are called
homorganic (e.g. ? and ?   as palatals), consonants whose sound is of the same nature
homogeneous (e.g. ? and ? as semi-vowels). On their hemorganic character and homogsneity
depends the possibility of interchange, whether within Hebrew itself or with the kindred

dialects. In such cases the soft sound generally interchanges with the soft, the hard with the
hard, &c. (e.g. ? = ?, ? = ?, ? = ?  ). Further transitions are not, however, excluded, as e.g. the
interchange of ? and ? (? = ? = ?). Here it is of importance to observe whether the change
takes place in an initial, medial, or final letter; since e.g. the change in a letter when medial
does not always prove the possibility of the change when initial. That in certain cases the
character of the consonantal sound also influences the preceding or following vowel will be
noticed in the accidence as the instances occur.

Rem. 2. Very probably in course of time certain nicer distinctions of

pronunciation became more and more neglected and finally were lost. Thus e.g. the
stronger ? rg, which was known to the LXX (see above, e), became in many cases
altogether lost to the later Jews; by the Samaritans and Galileans ? and ? were
pronounced merely as ?, and so in Ethiopic, ? like ?, ? like h, ? like s.

Rem. 3. The consonants which it is usual to describe especially as weak, are those which
readily coalesce with a preceding vowel to form a long vowel, viz. ?, ?, ? (as to ?, cf. § 23 k),
or those which are most frequently affected by the changes described in § 19 b–l, as again ?, ?,
?, and ?, and in certain cases ? and ?; finally the gutturals and ? for the reason given in § 22 b
and 22 q.

§ 7. The Vowels in General, Vowel Letters and Vowel Signs.

1. The original vowels in Hebrew, as in the other Semitic tongues, are a, i, u. E
and o always arise from an obscuring or contraction of these three pure sounds, viz. ?
by modification from ?? or ?; short ? from ?; ê by contraction from ai (properly ay);
and ô sometimes by modification (obscuring) from â, sometimes by contraction from
au (properly aw).1

In Arabic writing there are vowel signs only for a, i, u; the combined sounds ay and aw

?????????

are therefore retained uncontracted and pronounced as diphthongs (ai and au), e.g. ??? Arab.
sau?, and
 Arab. ?ainain. It was only in later Arabic that they became in pronunciation ê
and ô, at least after weaker or softer consonants; cf. ???? Arab. bain, bên, ??? Arab. yaum, yôm.
The same contraction appears also in other languages, e.g. in Greek and Latin (???µ?, Ionic
??µ?; plaustrum = polostrum), in the French pronunciation of ai and au, and likewise in the
German popular dialects (Oge for Auge, &c.). Similarly, the obscuring of the vowels plays a
part in various languages (cf. e.g. the a in modern Persian, Swedish, English, &c.).1

2. The partial expression of the vowels by certain consonants (?, ?, ?; ?), which
sufficed during the lifetime of the language, and for a still longer period afterwards
(cf. § 1 k), must in the main have passed through the following stages2:—

1 1 In proper names the LXX often use the diphthongs ?? and ?? where the Hebrew
form has ê or ô. It is, however, very doubtful whether the ?? and ?? of the LXX really
represent the true pronunciation of Hebrew of that time; see the instructive statistics
given by Kittel in Haupt’s SBOT., on 1 Ch 1:2, 20.
1 1 In Sanskrit, in the Old Persian cuneiform, and in Ethiopic, short a alone of all the
vowels is not represented, but the consonant by itself is pronounced with short a.
2 2 Cf. especially Stade, Lehrb. der hebr. Gr., p. 34 ff.

(a) The need of a written indication of the vowel first made itself felt in cases
where, after the rejection of a consonant, or of an entire syllable, a long vowel formed
the final sound of the word. The first step in such a case was to retain the original
final consonant, at least as a vowel letter, i. e. merely as an indication of a final vowel.
In point of fact we find even in the Old Testament, as already in the Mêša inscription,
a ? employed in this way (see below) as an indication of a final o. From this it was
only a step to the employment of the same consonant to indicate also other vowels
when final (thus, e.g. in the inflection of the verbs ???, the vowels ?,3 ?, è). After the
employment of ? as a vowel letter for ô and û, and of ? for ê and ??, had been
established (see below, e) these consonants were also employed—although not
consistently—for the same vowels at the end of a word.

According to § 91 b and d, the suffix of the 3rd sing. masc. in the noun (as in the verb)
was originally pronounced ??. But in the places where this ?? with a preceding a is contracted
into ô (after the rejection of the ?), we find the ? still frequently retained as a vowel letter, e.g.
???  Gn 49:11, cf. § 91 e; so throughout the Mêša inscription ??????, ?????? (also ?????),
??????,
?????, ???, ???, ????????????; on the other hand already in the Siloam inscription ????.4 ??? Mêša, 1.8
= ?????? his days is unusual, as also ??? 1. 20 if it is for ????? his chiefs. The verbal forms with ?
suffixed are to be read ?????????? (1. 6), ????????????? (1. 12f.) and ?? ??????????? (1. 19).

??

As an example of the original consonant being retained, we might also include the ? of the
constr. state plur. masc. if its ê (according to § 89 d) is contracted from an original ay. Against
this, however, it may be urged that the Phoenician inscriptions do not usually express this ê,
nor any other final vowel.1

(b) The employment of ? to denote ô, û, and of ? to denote ê, ??, may have resulted
from those cases in which a ? with a preceding a was contracted into au and further to
ô, or with a preceding u coalesced into û, and where ? with a has been contracted into
ai and further to ê, or with a preceding i into ?? (cf. § 24). In this case the previously
existing consonants were retained as vowel letters and were further applied at the end
of the word to denote the respective long vowels. Finally ? also will in the first
instance have established itself as a vowel letter only where a consonantal ? with a
preceding a had coalesced into â or ?.

.

????(cid:31)????

3 3 According to Stade, the employment of ? for ? probably took place first in the case
of the locative accusatives which originally ended in ? ??, as  (cid:31)?????? ,
4 4 The form ??? contradicts the view of Oort, Theol. Tijds., 1902, p. 374, that the
above instances from the Mêša-inscription are to be read benhu, bahn, lahu, which
were afterwards vocalized as beno, bo, lo.
1 1Thus there occurs, e.g. in Melit. 1, l. 3 ???? = ????? ??? ?? the two sons; elsewhere ?   for ???
(but ?? in the Mêša&#62 and Siloam inscrr.), ? for ??? (the latter in the Siloam inscr.),
??? = ??????? (so Mêša) or ????????, &c. Cf. on the other hand in Mêša,  ???
 = ???? (unless it
was actually pronounced anôkh by the Moabites!). As final ? is represented by ? and
? and final ?(cid:31) by ?, so final û is almost everywhere expressed by ? in Mêša, and
always in the Siloam inscription. It is indeed not impossible that Hebrew orthography
also once passed through a period in which the final vowels were left always or
sometimes undenoted, and that not a few strange forms in the present text of the Bible
are to be explained from the fact that subsequently the vowel letters (especially ? and
?) were not added in all cases. So Chwolson, ‘Die Quiescentia ??? in der althebr.
Orthogr., ’ in Travaux du Congrès … des Orientalistes, Petersb. 1876; cf. numerous
instances in Ginsburg, Introd., p. 146 ff.

The orthography of the Siloam inscription corresponds almost exactly with the above
assumptions. Here (as in the Mêša inscr.) we find all the long vowels, which have not arisen
from original diphthongs, without vowel letters, thus ???, ???????, ?????? (or ???????); ????, ???, ?? ??,
???. On the other hand ????? (from mau?a), ??? (from aud); ???? also, if it is to be read ??????, is an
instance of the retention of a ? which has coalesced with i into ??. Instances of the retention of
an originally consonantal ? as a vowel letter are
final ? is always represented by ?: ????, ?????, ???, ????. To this ??? alone would form an
exception (cf. however the note on ???, § 96), instead of ??? (Arab. yaum) day, which one
would expect. If the reading be correct, this is to be regarded as an argument that a
consciousness of the origin of many long vowels was lost at an early period, so that (at least
in the middle of the word) the vowel letters were omitted in places where they should stand,
according to what has been stated above, and added where there was no case of contraction.
This view is in a great measure confirmed by the orthography of the Mêša inscription. There
we find, as might be expected, ???? (= Daib?n, as the ?????? of the LXX proves), ??????? (ô
from au), and ?????? (ê from ai), but also even ????? ????2 instead of ????? ????? (from hauš-), ???? =
?? ???????, ??? four times, ????? once, for ???? and ?????? (from bait); ??? =

, ?????, and ?????, as also ????. Otherwise

 or ????.

?????

????

??????? , ?? =  ?????

(c) In the present state of Old Testament vocalization as it appears in the

Masoretic text, the striving after a certain uniformity cannot be mistaken, in spite of
the inconsistencies which have crept in. Thus the final long vowel is, with very few
exceptions (cf. § 9 d, and the very doubtful cases in § 8 k), indicated by a vowel
letter—and almost always by the same letter in certain nominal and verbal endings. In
many cases the use of ? to mark an ô or û, arising from contraction, and of ? for ê or ??,
is by far the more common, while we seldom find an originally consonantal ?
rejected, and the simple phonetic principle taking the place of the historical
orthography. On the other hand the number of exceptions is very great. In many cases
(as e.g. in the plural endings ?? ?? and ??) the vowel letters are habitually employed to
express long vowels which do not arise through contraction, and we even find short
vowels indicated. The conclusion is, that if there ever was a period of Hebrew writing
when the application of fixed laws to all cases was intended, either these laws were
not consistently carried out in the further transmission of the text, or errors and
confusion afterwards crept into it. Moreover much remained uncertain even in texts
which were plentifully provided with vowel letters. For, although in most cases the
context was a guide to the correct reading, yet there were also cases where, of the
many possible ways of pronouncing a word, more than one appeared admissible.1

3. When the language had died out, the ambiguity of such a writing must have
been found continually more troublesome; and as there was thus a danger that the
correct pronunciation might be finally lost, the vowel signs or vowel points were
invented in order to fix it. By means of these points everything hitherto left uncertain
was most accurately settled. It is true that there is no historical account of the date of
this vocalization of the O. T. text, yet we may at least infer, from a comparison of
other historical facts, that it was gradually developed by Jewish grammarians in the
sixth and seventh centuries A.D. under the influence of different Schools, traces of

2 2 ????? is the more strange since the name of king ?? ???? is represented as A-u si in
cuneiform as late as 728 B.C.
1 1Thus e.g. ??? can be read q??al, q???l, q??ôl, qe??l, qô??l, qi???l, qa???l, qu??al,
qè?el, and several of these forms have also different senses.

4. To complete the historical vocalization of the consonantal text a phonetic

system was devised, so exact as to show all vowel-changes occasioned by lengthening
of words, by the tone, by gutturals, &c., which in other languages are seldom
indicated in writing. The pronunciation followed is in the main that of the Palestinian
Jews of about the sixth century A.D., as observed in the solemn reading of the sacred
writings in synagogue and school, but based on a much older tradition. That the real
pronunciation of early Hebrew is consistently preserved by this tradition, has recently
been seriously questioned on good grounds, especially in view of the transcription of
proper names in the LXX. Nevertheless in many cases, internal reasons, as well as the
analogy of the kindred languages, testify in a high degree to the faithfulness of the

Occidentals, between Ben-Naphtali and Ben-Asher, who flourished in the first half of
the tenth century at Tiberias; cf. Ginsburg, Introd., p. 241 ff. Both sets of variants are
given by Baer in the appendices to his critical editions. Our printed editions present
uniformly the text of Ben-Asher, with the exception of a few isolated readings of Ben-
Naphtali, and of numerous later corruptions.

Preliminary Remark.

The next two sections (§§ 8 and 9) have been severely criticized (Philippi, ThLZ. 1897,
no. 2) for assigning a definite quantity to each of the several vowels, whereas in reality ??, ??,  ??
are merely signs for ä, e, o: ‘whether these are long or short is not shown by the signs
themselves but must be inferred from the rules for the pause which marks the breaks in
continuous narrative, or from other circumstances.’ But in the twenty-fourth and subsequent
German editions of this Grammar, in the last note on § 8 a [English ed. p. 38, note 4], it was
stated: ‘it must be mentioned that the Masoretes are not concerned with any distinction
between long and short vowels, or in general with any question of quantity. Their efforts are
directed to fixing the received pronunciation as faithfully as possible, by means of writing.
For a long time only ???????? ????? ?? seven kings were reckoned (vox memor. in Elias Levita  ????????
????????), Šureq and Qibbu? being counted as one vowel. The division of the vowels in respect of
quantity is a later attempt at a scientific conception of the phonetic system, which was not
invented but only represented by the Masoretes (Qimchi; Mikhlol, ed. Rittenb. 136 a,
distinguishes the five long as mothers from their five daughters).’

I have therefore long shared the opinion that ‘the vowel-system represented by the

ordinary punctuation (of Tiberias) was primarily intended to mark only differences of quality’
(Sievers, Metrische Studien, i. 17). There is, however, of course a further question how far
these ‘later’ grammarians were mistaken in assigning a particular quantity to the vowels
represented by particular signs. In Philippi’s opinion they were mistaken (excluding of course
??, ê, ô when written plene) in a very great number of cases, since not only does ?? stand,
according to circumstances, for ?? or ??, and ?? for ?? or ??, but also ?? for ? or ?, and  ??  for ? or ?,
e.g. ????? and ?????, out of pause kå?b??d, qå?:??n (form ?????), but in pause kå?b?d, qå???n.

I readily admit, with regard to Qame? and Segol, that the account formerly given in § 8 f.

was open to misconstruction. With regard to ?ere and ?olem, however, I can only follow
Philippi so long as his view does not conflict with the (to me inviolable) law of a long vowel
in an open syllable before the tone and (except Patha?) in a final syllable with the tone. To me
????? = k??b??d, &c., is as impossible as e.g. ????? = ?nab or ?????? = b?rakh, in spite of the analogy
cited by Sievers (p. 18, note 1) that ‘in old German e.g. original ?? and ? often pass into ? and ?
dialectically, while remaining in a closed syllable.

1. The full vowels (in contrast to the half-vowels or vowel trills, § 10 a–f),
classified according to the three principal vowel sounds (§ 7 a), are as follows:—

First Class. A-sound.

ThLZ. ThLZ. = Theologische Literaturzeitung, ed. by E. Schürer. Lpz. 1876 ff.

1. ??1 Q?m?? denotes either ?, â, more strictly å? (the obscure Swedish å) and å?,2 as

A

??? yå?d (hand), ?? ????? r?’š??m (heads), or å? (in future transcribed as ?),
called Q?me? ???ûph, i. e. hurried Qame?. The latter occurs almost
exclusively as a modification of ?; cf. c and § 9 u.

2. ?? Páth??, ?, ??? b?th (daughter).

Also 3. ?? Segôl, an open e, è (? or ä?), as a modification of ?, 1 either in an untoned
closed syllable, as in the first syllable of ??????? yädkhèm (your hand) from y?dhèm—or
??????  p?sa?; cf. ?????, and on the really monosyllabic character
in a tone-syllable as in
of such formations, see § 28 e. But Segôl in an open tone-syllable with a following ?,
 y?dèkh? (cf. § 91 i), is due to contraction from ay.
as in

 gelèn? (cf. § 75 f),

?????????

????????

Second Class. I- and E-sounds.

1. ? ?? ???r?q with yod, almost always ??, as ?????? ?add??q (righteous).

I

E

2. ?? either ?? (see below, i), as ???????? ?add??q??m, only orthographically different from

??????

(

?????

)

,—or ??, as ?????? ???dqô (his righteousness).

3. ? ?? ?er?? or ??rê with yod=ê, e.g. ????? bêthô (his house).

?? either ê, but rarely (see below, i), or ? as ? ?? š?m (name).

1 1 In early MSS. the sign for Qame? is a stroke with a point underneath, i.e.
according to Nestle’s discovery (ZDMG. 1892, p. 411 f.), Path? with ?olem, the latter
suggesting the obscure pronunciation of Qame? as å. Cf. also Ginsburg, Introd., p.
609.
2 2 Instead of the no doubt more accurate transcription å(cid:31), å(cid:31) we have retained ?, â
in this grammar, as being typographically simpler and not liable to any
misunderstanding. For Qame? ?a?uph, in the previous German edition expressed by
å(cid:31), we have, after careful consideration, returned to ? The use of the same sign ?? for
å(cid:31) (å(cid:31)) and å(cid:31), shows that the Massoretes did not intend to draw a sharp distinction
between them. We must not, however, regard the Jewish grammarians as making a
merely idle distinction between Q?me? r???h, or broad Qame?, and Q?me? hatûph,
or light Qame?. It is quite impossible that in the living language an ? lengthened from
?, as in d?b?r, should have been indistinguishable from e.g. the last vowel in ? ?????? or
the first in ?? ???????.—The notation ?, ê, ô expresses here the vowels essentially long,
either naturally or by contraction; the notation ?, ?, ô those lengthened only by the
tone, and therefore changeable; ?, ?, ? the short vowels. As regards the others, the
distinction into i and ?, ? and ? is sufficient; see § 9.—The mark (cid:31) stands in the
following pages over the tone-syllable, whenever this is not the last, as is usual, but
the penultimate syllable of the word, e.g.
1 1 These Segôls, modified from ?, are very frequent in the language. The Babylonian
punctuation (see § 8 g, note 3) has only one sign for it and tone-bearing Pathah.; see
also Gaster, ‘Die Unterschiedslosigkeit zwischen Pathach u. Segol,’ in ZAW. 1894, p.
60 ff.

??(cid:31)? ?? .

?ere can only be ?, in my opinion, in few cases, such as those mentioned in § 29 f.

4. ?? Segôl, ??, a modification of ??, e.g. ??????? ???äƒ??? (ground-form ???ƒ?); ?? ?? šän

(ground-form š??n).

Third Class. U- and O-sounds.

1. ? Šûre??q, usually û, ??? mûth (to die), rarely ?.

U

2. ?? Qibbû?, either ?, e.g. ????? s?ll?m (ladder): or û, e.g.

?????  q?m? (rise up),

instead of the usual

???

??

.

3. ? and ?? ??l?m, ô and ?, ??? qôl (voice), ??? r?bh (multitude). Often also a

defective ?? for ô; rarely ? for ?.

O

On the question whether ?? under some circumstances represents ?, see § 93 r.

4. ?? On Q?m?? ????ph=?, generally modified from ?, as ???? ??q (statute), see

above, a.

??????  opening;

The names of the vowels are mostly taken from the form and action of the mouth
??????  a wide parting (of the mouth),
??????  (=??) breaking, parting (cf. the Arab. kasr);
 (also ?????) narrow opening;
 closing, according to others fullness, i.e. of the mouth (also ??? ?????1 fullness of

in producing the various sounds, as
also
??????
the mouth).
compression or contraction of the mouth. Segôl (????? bunch of grapes) takes its name
from its form. So ??????? ?? ?? (three points) is another name for Qibbû?.

?????? 2 also denotes a slighter, as ????? and ????? (also ??? ????) a firmer,

???????

Moreover the names were mostly so formed (but only later), that the sound of
each vowel is heard in the first syllable (????? for ?????, ????? for ????? ????? for ?????); in order
to carry this out consistently some even write Sägôl, Qome?-?a?ûf, Qübbû?.

2. As the above examples show, the vowel sign stands regularly under the
consonant, after which it is to be pronounced, ?? r?, ?? r?, ?? r?, ?? r?, &c. The Patha?
called furtivum (§ 22 f) alone forms an exception to this rule, being pronounced
before the consonant, ???? rûa? (wind, spirit). The ??l?m (without w?w) stands on the
left above the consonant; ?? r? (but ??=l?). If ?, as a vowel letter, follows a consonant
which is to be pronounced with ?, the point is placed over its right arm, thus ???,
????; but e.g. ????, since ? here begins a syllable.

1 1 On the erroneous use of the term melo pum, only in Germany, for šûreq (hence
also pronounced melu pum to indicate û), see E. Nestle, ZDMG. 1904, p. 597 ff.;
Bacher, ibid., p. 799 ff., Melopum; Simonsen, ibid., p. 807 ff.
2 2 The usual spelling ????? and ????? takes the words certainly rightly as Hebrew
substantives; according to De Lagarde (Gött. gel. Anz. 1886, p. 873, and so previously
Luzzatto), ????? and ????? are rather Aram. participles, like Dageš, &c., and
consequently to be transliterated Qa(cid:31)m?? and Pâthah.

No dot is used for the ?olem when ? (of course without w?w) is pronounced after ?n or
before š??n. Hence ???? ?ôn? (hating), ???? ne?? (to bear), ? ??? môšè (not ? ????); but ????? šôm?r
(a watchman). When ? precedes the ?in, the dot is placed over its right arm, e.g. ??????? yirp??
(he treads with the feet),

????? ????  hannô?e??m (those who carry).

??

In the sign ?, the ? may also be a consonant. The ? is then either to be read ?w (necessarily
so when a consonant otherwise without a vowel precedes, e.g. ????? lôwè, lending) or w?, when
a vowel already precedes the ?, e.g. ???? ?wôn (iniquity) for ?????. In more exact printing, a
distinction is at least made between ? wo and ? (i.e. either ô or, when another vowel follows
the w?w, ôw3).

3

3 Since 1846 we have become acquainted with a system of vocalization different
in many respects from the common method. The vowel signs, all except ?, are there
placed above the consonants, and differ almost throughout in form, and some even as
regards the sound which they denote: tone-bearing ? and In an unsharpened syllable
toneless ? and è, and also ?a?eph Patha?; toneless ? and ?a?eph Seghôl; and ?a?eph
Qame?. Lastly in toneless syllables before Dageš, The accents differ less and stand in
some cases under the line of the consonants. Besides this complicated system of the
Codex Babylonicus (see below) and other MSS., there is a simpler one, used in
Targums. It is still uncertain whether the latter is the foundation of the former (as
Merx, Chrest. Targ. xi, and Bacher, ZDMG. 1895, p. 15 ff.), or is a later development
of it among the Jews of South Arabia (as Praetorius, ZDMG. 1899, p. 181 ff.). For the
older literature on this Babylonian punctuation (??????? ?????), as it is called, see A.
Harkavy and H. L. Strack, Katalog der hebr. Bibelhandschr. der Kaiserl. öffentl.
Bibliothek zu St. Petersb., St. Petersb. and Lpz., 1875, parts i and ii, p. 223 ff. A more
thorough study of the system was made possible by H. Strack’s facsimile edition of
the Prophetarum posteriorum codex Babylonicus Petropolttanus (St. Petersb., 1876,
la. fol.) of the year 916, which Firkowitsch discovered in 1839, in the synagogue at
Tschufutkale in the Crimea. The MS. has been shown by Ginsburg (Recueil des
travaux rédigés en mémoire … de Chwolson, Berlin, 1899, p. 149, and Introd., pp.
216 ff., 475 f.) to contain a recension of the Biblical text partly Babylonian and partly
Palestinian; cf. also Barnstein, The Targum of Onkelos to Genesis, London, 1896, p. 6
f. Strack edited a fragment of it in Hosea et Joel prophetae ad fidem cod. Babylon.
Petrop., St. Petersb. 1875. Cf. also the publication by A. Merx, quoted above, § 7 h,
and his Chrestomathia Targumica, Berlin, 1888; G. Margoliouth, in the PSBA. xv. 4,
and M. Gaster, ibid.; P. Kahle, Der masoret. Text des A. T. nach d. Überlief. der
babyl. Juden, Lpz. 1902, with the valuable review by Rahlfs in GGA. 1903, no. 5;
Nestle, ZDMG. 1905, p. 719 (Babylonian ?. According to the opinion formerly
prevailing, this Babylonian punctuation exhibits the system which was developed in
the Eastern schools, corresponding to and contemporaneous with the Western or
Tiberian system, although a higher degree of originality, or approximation to the
original of both systems of punctuation, was generally conceded to the latter.
Recently, however, Wickes, Accents of the Twenty-one Books, Oxford, 1887, p. 142
ff, has endeavoured to show, from the accents, that the ‘Babylonian’ punctuation may
certainly be an Oriental, but is by no means the Oriental system. It is rather to be
regarded, according to him, as a later and not altogether successful attempt to modify,
and thus to simplify, the system common to all the Schools in the East and West.
Strack, Wiss. Jahresb. der ZDMG. 1879, p. 124, established the probability that the

3. The vowels of the first class are, with the exception of ? ?? in the middle and ? ??,

? ??, ? ?? at the end of the word (§ 9 a–d, f), represented only by vowel signs, but the
long vowels of the I- and U-class largely by vowel letters. The vowel sound to which
the letter points is determined more precisely by the vowel sign standing before,
above, or within it. Thus—

? may be combined with ???r?q, ??rê, Segôl (? ??, ? ??, ? ??).

? with Šûr?q and ??l?m (? and ?).1

In Arabic the long a also is regularly expressed by a vowel letter, viz. ’Al?ph (? ??), so that

in that language three vowel letters correspond to the three vowel classes. In Hebrew ? is
rarely used as a vowel letter; see § 9 b and § 23 g.

4. The omission of the vowel letters when writing ??, û, ê, ô is called scriptio
defectiva in contrast to scriptio plena.  ??? , ??? are written plene, ?????, ??? defective.

Cf. Bardowitz, Studien zur Gesch. der Orthogr. im Althebr., 1894; Lidzbarski, Ephem., i.
182, 275; Marmorstein, ‘Midrasch der vollen u. defekt. Schreibung, ’ in ZAW. 1907, p. 33 ff.

So far as the choice of the full or defective mode of writing is concerned, there are

certainly some cases in which only the one or the other is admissible, Thus the full
form is necessary at the end of the word, for û, ô, ?, ??, ê, ?, as well as for è in ????? &c.
(§ 9 f), also generally with â, ? (cf. however § 9 d), e.g. ???????,
, ?????, ???????. (But the
Masora requires in Jer 26:6, 44:8; Ezr 6:21; 2 Ch 32:13 ???? instead of ?????; Zp 2:9 ????
[perhaps an error due to the following ?] for ?????; Is 40:31 ?????? [followed by ?] for ???????;
Jer 38:11 ?????? for ???????.) On the other hand the defective writing is common when the
letter, which would have to be employed as a vowel letter, immediately precedes as a
strong consonant, e.g. ????? (nations) for ??????, ?????? (commandments) for ???????.

?????

?????

That much is here arbitrary (see § 7 g), follows from the fact that sometimes the same
word is written very differently, e.g. ?????????? Ez 16:60: ????????? and also ????????? Jer 23:4; cf. § 25
b. Only it may be observed,

vowels of the superlinear punctuation arose under Arab influence from the vowel
letters ??? (so previously Pinsker and Graetz), while the Tiberian system shows Syrian
influence.

A third, widely different system (Palestinian), probably the basis of the other two,
is described by A. Neubauer, JQR. vii. 1895, p. 361 ff., and Friedländer, ibid., p. 564
ff., and PSBA. 1896, p. 86 ff.; C. Levias, Journ. of Sem. Lang. and Lit., xv. p. 157 ff.;
and esp. P. Kahle, Beitr. zu der Gesch. der hebr. Punktation, ’ in ZAW. 1901, p. 273
ff. and in Der masoret. Text des A. T. (see above), chiefly dealing with the Berlin MS.
Or. qu. 680, which contains a number of variants on the biblical text, and frequently
agrees with the transcriptions of the LXX and Jerome.

1 1 After the example of the Jewish grammarians the expression, ‘the vowel letter
rests (quiesces) in the vowel-sign,’ has become customary. On the other hand, the
vowel letters are also called by the grammarians, matres lectionis or supports (fulcra).

(a) That the scriptio plena in two successive syllables was generally avoided; cf. e.g. ??????
.

but ????????; ??????, but ????????; ???, ?????; ?? ??????;

?????????

(b) That in the later Books of the O. T. (and regularly in post-biblical Hebrew) the full

form, in the earlier the defective, is more usual.

5. In the cognate dialects, when a vowel precedes a vowel-letter which is not
kindred (heterogeneous), e.g. ? ??, ? ??, ?? ??, ? ??, ? ??, a diphthong (au, ai)2 is formed if the
heterogeneous vowel be a. This is also to be regarded as the Old Hebrew
pronunciation, since it agrees with the vocalic character of ? and ? (§ 5 b, note 2). Thus
such words as ???, ???, ???, ?????, ???,
 are not to be pronounced according to the usual
Jewish custom1 as v?v, ?ay, gôy, ?sûy, g?v, bayith (or even as vaf, &c.; cf. modern
Greek av af, ev ef for ??, ??), but with the Italian Jews more like w?u, ?ai, &c. The
sound of ?? ?? is the same as ? ??, i.e. almost like ?u, so that ? ?? is often written
defectively for ?? ??.

??????

§ 9. Character of the several Vowels.

Numerous as are the vowel signs in Hebrew writing, they are yet not fully

adequate to express all the various modifications of the vowel sounds, especially with
respect to length and shortness. To understand this better a short explanation of the
character and value of the several vowels is required, especially in regard to their
length and shortness as well as to their changeableness (§§ 25, 27).

First Class. A-sound.

1. Qame? (??), when it represents a long a, is, by nature and origin, of two kinds:—

(1) The essentially long â (in Arabic regularly written ? ??), which is not readily
shortened and never wholly dropped (§ 25 c), e.g. ????? kethâbh (writing); very seldom
with a following ?, as ???? 2 S 12:1, 4 (see the examples in § 72 p).2

The writing of ???? Ho 10:14 for ??? would only be justifiable, if the ? of this form were to
be explained as a contraction of ?? cf. however § 72 a; ???? Neh 13:16 for ??? (d?g) is certainly
incorrect.—The rarity of the â in Hebrew arises from the fact that it has for the most part
become an obtuse ô; see below, q.

(2) ?, lengthened only by position (i.e. tone-long or at all events lengthened under
the influence of the tone, according to the laws for the formation of syllables, § 27 e–
h), either in the tone-syllable itself (or in the secondary tone-syllable indicated by
Mèth?g, see below), or just before or after it. This sound is invariably lengthened from
an original ?, 3 and is found in open syllables, i.e. syllables ending in a vowel (§ 26 b),

2 2 Cf. T. C. Foote, The diphthong ai in Hebrew (Johns Hopkins Univ. Circulars,
June, 1903, p. 70 ff.).
1 1 In MSS. ? and ?, in such combinations as ???, ???, are even marked with Mapp?(cid:31)q (§
14 a).
2 2 Of a different kind are the cases in which ? has lost its consonantal sound by
coalescing with a preceding a, a § 23 a–d.
3 3 In Arabic this ? is always retained in an open syllable.

e.g. ????, ?????, ?????, ????? (Arab. l?k?, q?t?l?, y?qûm?, ?s??r?), as well as in closed
syllables, i.e. those ending in a consonant, as ???, ????? (vulgar Arab. y?d, kauk?b). In a
; whereas
closed syllable, however, it can only stand when this has the tone,
. Where
??????
in an open syllable it is especially frequent before the tone, e.g.
the tone is moved forward or weakened (as happens most commonly in what is called
the construct state of nouns, cf. § 89 a) the original short ? (Patha?) is retained in a
closed syllable, while in an open syllable it becomes Šewa (§ 27 i): ?????, constr. state
????? (?(cid:31)kh?m); ?????, ????? (debh?r); ?????, ???????. For examples of the retention, in the
secondary tone-syllable, of ? lengthened from ?, see § 93 xx.

In some terminations of the verb (?? in the 2nd sing. masc. perf., ?? in the 2nd pl.
fem. of the imperat., as well as in the 3rd and 2nd pl. fem. of the imperf.), in ??? thou
(masc.) and in the suffixes ?? and ??, the final ? can stand even without a vowel letter. A
? is, however, in these cases (except with ??) frequently added as a vowel letter.

On ?? for ? see below, f.

2. Patha?, or short ?, stands in Hebrew almost exclusively in a closed syllable

??
,

??????

????????

with or without the tone (
). In places where it now appears to stand in an
open syllable the syllable was originally closed, and a helping vowel (?, ??) has been
inserted after the second radical merely to make the pronunciation easier, e.g.
(ground-form na?l),
different kind, § 25 g, h. Otherwise ? in an open syllable has almost without exception
passed into ? (??), see above, c.

 (Arab. bait), see § 28 d, and with regard to two cases of a

union of Patha? with ? (? ??), see § 23 d, end. On ? as a helping-vowel, § 22 f(Patha?
furtivum), and § 28 e.

3. Segôl (?, è [?]) by origin belongs sometimes to the second, but most frequently

to the first vowel class (§ 27 o, p, u). It belongs to the first class when it is a
modification of a (as the Germ. Bad, pl. Büder; Eng. man, pl. men), either in a
??????  from ’ar?,
??????
toneless syllable, e.g. ??????? (for yadkhèm), or with the tone, e.g.
??????  Arab. q?m?. This Segôl is often retained even in the strongest tone-
Arab. q?rn,
??????? , ??????
syllable, at the end of a sentence or of an important clause (in pause), as
(m???lä?kh, s???dä?q). As a rule, however, in such cases the Patha? which underlies the
Segôl is lengthened into Qume?, e.g.
?????? , ??????. A Segôl apparently lengthened from
Šewa, but in reality traceable to an original ?, stands in pausal forms, as ?????? (ground-
form p?ry), ?????? (y?hy), &c. On the cases where a ? (originally consonantal) follows
this Segôl, see § 75 f, and § 91 k.

Second Class. I- and E-sounds.

4. The long ?? is frequently even in the consonantal writing indicated by ? (a fully
written ?ireq ? ??); but a naturally long ?? can be also written defectively (§ 8 i), e.g. ??????
(righteous), plur. ???????? ?add??q??m; ??????. (he fears), plur. ???????. Whether a defectively

written ?ireq is long may be best known from the origin of the form; often also from
the nature of the syllable (§ 26), or as in ???????. from the Metheg attached to it (§ 16 f).

5. The short ?ireq (always1 written defectively) is especially frequent in sharpened

syllables (?????, ?????) and in toneless closed syllables (??????? psalm); cf. however ?? ?????? in
???????? , with a helping Segôl, for wayyiphn. It has arisen
a closed tone-syllable, and even
very frequently by attenuation from ?, as in ??????? from original d?b?rê, ??????? (ground-
form ??dq),2 or else it is the original ??, which in the tone-syllable had become ?, as in
????????? (thy enemy) from ????? (ground-form ’ây?b)3 It is sometimes a simple helping
vowel, as in

, § 28 e.

??????

The earlier grammarians call every ?ireq written fully, ?ireq magnum; every one written

defectively, ?ireq parvum,—a misleading distinction, so far as quantity is concerned.

6. The longest ê ? ?? (more rarely defective ??, e.g. ????? for ?????? Is 3:8; at the end of a

word also ??) is as a rule contracted from ? ?? ay (ai), § 7 a, e.g. ?????? (palace), Arab.
and Syriac haikal.

7. The ?ere without Yôdh mostly represents the tone-long ?, which, like the tone-

long ? (see c), is very rarely retained except in and before the tone-syllable, and is
always lengthened from an original ??. It stands in an open syllable with or before the
tone, e.g.
§ 16 d, f) in the secondary tone-syllable, e.g. ???????? ?? my request, ???????? let us go. On
the other hand in a closed syllable it is almost always with the tone, as ??? son, ?????
dumb.

??????  (ground-form s??phr) book,  ?? ????

 (Arab. s??n?t) sleep, or with Metheg (see

Exceptions: (a) ? is sometimes retained in a toneless closed syllable, in monosyllabic

words before Maqqeph, e.g. ????? Nu 35:18, as well as in the examples of n?sôg ’??ôr
mentioned in § 29 f (on the quantity cf. § 8 b 3 end); (b) in a toneless open final syllable, ?ere
likewise occurs in examples of the n?sôg ’??ôr, as

??????  Ex 16:29; cf. Ju 9:39.

8. The Segôl of the I(E)-class is most frequently an ? modified from original ??,
either replacing a tone-long ? which has lost the tone, e.g. ???? from ??? (give), ????????? (thy
creator) from ?????, or in the case discussed in § 93 o, ???????, ??????? from the ground-forms
?ilq, ?izr; cf. also § 64 f. Segôl appears as a simple helping-vowel in cases such as
??????
for siphr,

??????  for yigl (§ 28 e).

Third Class. U- and O-sounds.

9. For the U-sound there is—

1 1 At least according to the Masoretic orthography; cf. Wellhausen, Text der Bb.
Sam., p. 18, Rem.
2 2 Jerome (cf. Siegfried, ZAW. 1884, p. 77) in these cases often gives ? for ?(cid:31).
3 3 Cf. the remarks of I. Guidi, ‘La pronuncia del ??r?, ’ in the Verhandl. des
Hamburger Orient.-Kongr. of 1902, Leiden, 1904, p. 208 ff., on Italian e for Latin i,
as in fede = f?(cid:31)dem, pece = p?(cid:31)cem.

(1) the long û, either (a) written fully, ? Šureq, e.g. ????? (boundary), or (b)

defectively written ?? Qibbû? ??????, ???????;

(2) the short ?, mostly represented by Qibbû?, in a toneless closed syllable and

especially common in a sharpened syllable, in e.g. ????? ?? (table), ????? (booth).

Sometimes also ? in a sharpened syllable is written ?, e.g. ????? Ps 102:5,  ????

??

 Jb 5:7, ?????

Jer. 31:34, ???????? Is 5:5, ???????? Gn 2:25 for ?????, &c.

For this u the LXX write o, e.g. ??????? ??????µ, from which, however, it only follows, that

this ? was pronounced somewhat indistinctly. The LXX also express the sharp ?ireq by ?,
e.g. ?????=?µµ??. The pronunciation of the Qibbû? like the German ü, which was formerly
common, is incorrect, although the occasional pronunciation of the U-sounds as ü in the time
of the punctators is attested, at least as regards Palestine1; cf. the Turkish buülbuül for the
Persian bulbul, and the pronunciation of the Arabic duny? in Syria as düny?.

10. The O-sound bears the same relation to U as the E does to I in the second

class. It has four varieties:—

(1) The ô which is contracted from aw (=au), § 7 a, and accordingly is mostly
written fully; ? (Holem plenum), e.g. ??? (a whip), Arab. sau?, ????? (iniquity) from
???????. More rarely defectively, as ????? ?? (thine ox) from ??? Arab. ?aur.

(2) The long ô which arose in Hebrew at an early period, by a general process of

obscuring, out of an original â, 2 while the latter has been retained in Arabic and
Aramaic. It is usually written fully in the tone-syllable, defectively in the toneless, e.g.
????? Arab. qât??l. Aram. qâ??l, ?????? Arab. ’??lâh, Aram. ’?lâh, plur. ????????; ??? (leg),
Arab. sâq; ????? (hero), Arab. g?bbâr; ????? (seal), Arab. ?ât?m; ????? (pomegranate),
Arab. r?mmân; ????? ?? (dominion), Aram. ????? ?? and ????? ?? Arab. s?l?ân; ??? ?? (peace),
Aram. ??? ??, Arab. s?lâm. Sometimes the form in â also occurs side by side with that in
ô as ????? ?? and ????? ?? (coat of mail; see however § 29 u). Cf. also § 68 b.

(3) The tone-long ? which is lengthened from an original ?, or from an ? arising
from ?, by the tone, or in general according to the laws for the formation of syllables.
It occurs not only in the tone-syllable, but also in an open syllable before the tone, e.g.
????? (ground-form q??) sanctuary; ?????? for burrakh, ????????? Ps 104:28, as well as
(with Metheg) in the secondary tone-syllable; ?????????, ???????. But the original ? (?) is
retained in a toneless closed syllable, whereas in a toneless open syllable it is
weakened to Še?a. Cf. ??? all, but ???? (ko(cid:31)l), ????? (k?ll?m); ???????, ?????????? and ????????,
where original ? is weakened to Še?a: yiq???elû, Arab. yaqt?lû. This tone-long ? is only
as an exception written fully.

(4) ?? Qame?-?a?uph represents ? (properly å?, cf. § 8 a, note 2) modified from ?
and is therefore classed here. It stands in the same relation to ?olem as the Segôl of
the second class to Sere, ???? k?l,
Qame?, see below, u.

????????  wayy?q?m. On the distinction between this and

1 1 Cf. Delitzsch, Physiologie u. Musik, Lpz. 1868, p. 15 f.
2 2 Cf. above, b, end. On Jerome’s transliteration of o for ?, see ZAW. 1884, p. 75.

Rem. On the distinction between Qame? and Qame?-?a?uph.1

According to § 8 a, long ? or ?? (Qame?) and short ? or å? (Qame?-?a?uph) are in

manuscripts and printed texts generally expressed by the same sign ( ? ), e.g. ??? q?m, ???? k?l.
The beginner who does not yet know the grammatical origin of the words in question (which
is of course the surest guide), may depend meanwhile on the following principal rules:—

1. The sign ??1 is ? in a toneless closed syllable, since such a syllable can have only

a short vowel (§ 26 o). The above case occurs—

(a) When Šewâ follows as a syllable-divider, as in

????????

 ??kh-má? (wisdom),

???????

’?kh-lá? (food). With Metheg ?? is ? (å?) and according to the usual view stands in an
open syllable with a following Šewâ mobile, e.g. ??????? ’?-khelá? (she ate); but cf. § 16 i.

1 1 These statements, in order to be fully understood, must be studied in connexion
with the theory of syllables (§ 26) and Metheg (§ 16 c–i).
1 1 In the Babylonian punctuation (§ 8 g, note) ? and ? are carefully distinguished. So
also in many MSS with the ordinary punctuation and in Baer’s editions of the text
since 1880, in which ??? is used for ? as well as for (cid:31). Cf. Baer-Delitzsch, Liber Jobi,
p. 43. But the identity of the two signs is certainly original, and the use of ?? for (cid:31) is
misleading.

(b) When a closed syllable is formed by Dageš forte, e.g.

????????

 ??nn?n?? (have

mercy upon me); but

????????

 (with Metheg, § 16 f ?) bâtt??m.

(c) When the syllable in question loses the tone on account of a following

Maqq?ph (§ 16 a), e.g. ??????????? k?l-h?-’?dá?m (all men).

In Ps 35:10 and Pr 19:7 Maqq?ph with ??? is replaced by a conjunctive accent (Merekha);

so by Darga, Ju 19:5 with ?????, and Ez 37:8 with ????????? (so Baer after Qim?i; ed. Mant.,
Ginsburg, Kittel ??????).

(d) In a closed final syllable without the tone, e.g.

????????  wayyá?q?m (and he stood

up).—In the cases where â or ? in the final syllable has become toneless through
Maqq?ph (§ 16 a) and yet remains, e.g. ???????????? Est 4:8, ?????? ?? Gn 4:25, it has a
Metheg in correct manuscripts and printed texts.

In cases like

??????? ,

??????  lá?mm?, the tone shows that ?? is to be read as ?.

?

2. The cases in which ?? appears to stand in an open syllable and yet is to be read as ?
require special consideration. This is the case, (a) when ?a?eph-Qame? follows, e.g. ??????? his
work, or simple vocal Šewâ, e.g. ???????? ox goad; ????????? Jo 4:7; ?????? ?? (so ed. Mant., Ginsb.)
preserve Ps 86:2, cf. 16:1 and the cases mentioned in § 48 i, n., and § 61 f, n.; other examples
are Ob 11, Ju 14:15); ?a?eph-Patha? follows in ????? ?????? (so Ginsburg; Baer ????? ??????) 1 S 15:1,
???????????? 24:11, and ??? ????????? (so Baer, Gn 32:18, others ??? ????????); (b) before another Qame?-
?a?uph, e.g.  ?????????
 thy work; on ????????? and ?????????? Nu 23:7, see §67 o; (c) in the two plural
forms ?? ??????? sanctuaries and ?? ????? ?? roots (also written ???? and ?? ??). In all these cases the
Jewish grammarians regard the Metheg accompanying the ?? as indicating a Q?me? ra?abh
(broad Qame?) and therefore read the ?? as ?; thus p?-olô, d?-reb?n, p?-?lekh?, q?-d?š??m. But
neither the origin of these forms, nor the analogous formations in Hebrew and in the cognate
languages, nor the transcription of proper names in the LXX, allows us to regard this view as
correct. It is just possible that Qame? is here used loosely for å?, as the equivalent of ?, on the
analogy of ??????? &c., § 93 q. As a matter of fact, however, we ought no doubt to divide and
read p?o-lô (for p(cid:31)-lô), p??-lekh?, q?d?-ším.—Quite as inconceivable is it for Metheg to be a
sign of the lengthening into ? in ???????????? (Ex 11:8), although it is so in ???????? b?-°n?? (in the
navy), since here the ? of the article appears under the ?.

§ 10. The Half Vowels and the Syllable Divider (Šewâ).

1. Besides the full vowels, Hebrew has also a series of vowel sounds which may
be called half vowels (Sievers, Murmelvokale). The punctuation makes use of these to
represent extremely slight sounds which are to be regarded as remains of fuller and
more distinct vowels from an earlier period of the language. They generally take the
place of vowels originally short standing in open syllables. Such short vowels, though
preserved in the kindred languages, are not tolerated by the present system of pointing
in Hebrew, but either undergo a lengthening or are weakened to Šewâ. Under some
circumstances, however, the original short vowel may reappear.

To these belongs first of all the sign ??, which indicates an extremely short, slight,
and (as regards pronunciation) indeterminate vowel sound, something like an obscure

half ? (e). It is called Šewâ,1 which may be either simple Šewâ (Šewâ simplex) as
distinguished from the compound (see f), or vocal Šewâ (Šewâ mobile) as
distinguished from Šewâ quiescens, which is silent and stands as a mere syllable
divider (see i) under the consonant which closes the syllable.

The vocal Šewâ stands under a consonant which is closely united, as a kind of
grace-note, with the following syllable, either (a) at the beginning of the word, as ?????
qe??l (to kill), ??????? memall? (filling), or (b) in the middle of the word, as ???????? qô-?el?,
???????? yiq-?elû.

In former editions of this Grammar Šewâ was distinguished as medium when it followed a

short vowel and therefore stood in a supposed ‘loosely closed’ or ‘wavering’ syllable, as in
???????, ???????. According to Sievers, Metrisch Studien, i. 22, this distinction must now be
abandoned. These syllables are really closed, and the original vowel is not merely shortened,
but entirely elided. The fact that a following Begadkephath letter (§ 6 n) remains spirant
instead of taking Dageš lene, is explained by Sievers on the ‘supposition that the change from
hard to spirant is elder than the elision of the vowel, and that the prehistoric malakai became
malakhai before being shortened to malkh?’. In cases like ?????? (from ?????), ?????? (from ?????) the
dropping of the Dageš forte shows that the original vowel is completely lost.

The sound ? has been adopted as the normal transcription of simple Šewâ mobile,
although it is certain that it often became assimilated in sound to other vowels. The LXX
express it by ?, or even by ?, ???????? ???????µ, ?????????? ?????????, more frequently by ?,
????? ??, ??µ????, but very frequently by assimilating its indeterminate sound to the following
principal vowel, e.g. ????? ????µ?, ????? ?? ????µ?? (as well as ????µ??), ??????? ??????,
????????? ????????.1 A similar account of the pronunciation of Šewâ is given by Jewish
grammarians of the middle ages.2

How the Šewâ sound has arisen through the vanishing of a full vowel is seen, e.g. in ???????
from b?r?k?, as the word is still pronounced in Arabic. In that language the full short vowel
regularly corresponds to the Hebrew Šewâ mobile.

1 1 On ??? ??, the older and certainly the only correct form (as in Ben Asher), see Bather,
ZDMG. 1895, p. 18, note 3, who compares Šewayya, the name of the Syriac accentual
sign of similar form (cid:31)? (=Hebr. Zaqeph). The form ??? ??, customary in Spain since the
time of Mena?em b. Sarûq, is due to a supposed connexion with Aram. ??? ?? rest, and
hence would originally have denoted only Šewâ quiescens, like the Arabic suk?n
(rest). The derivation from ??? ??, ???? ?? (stem ? ????, Levias, American Journ. of Philol.,
xvi. 28 ff.) seems impossible.
1 1 The same occurs frequently also in the Greek and Latin transcriptions of
Phoenician words, e.g. ??????? Malaga, ???????? gubulim (Schröder, Die phöniz. Spr., p.
139 ff.). Cf. the Latin augment in momordi, pupugi, with the Greek in ??????,
????µµ????, and the old form memordi.
2 2 See especially Yehuda ?ayyû?, pp. 4 f. and 130 f. in Nutt’s edition (Lond. 1870),
corresponding to p. 200 of the edition by Dukes (Stuttg. 1844); Ibn Ezra’s ?a?oth, p.
3; Gesenius, Lehrgebäude der hebr. Sprache, p. 68. The Manuel du lecteur,
mentioned above, § 6 b, also contains express rules for the various ways of
pronouncing Šewâ mobile: so too the Dikduks ha-?eeamim, ed. by Baer and Strack,
Lpz. 1879, p. 12 ff. Cf. also Schreiner, ZAW. vi. 236 ff.

2. Connected with the simple Šewâ môbile is the compound Šewâ or ?â??ph
(correptum), i.e. a Šewâ the pronunciation of which is more accurately fixed by the
addition of a short vowel. There are three Šewâ-sounds determined in this way,
corresponding to the three vowel classes (§ 7 a):—

(??) ?â??ph-Páth??, e.g. ????? ?amôr, ass.

(??) ?â??ph-Segôl), e.g. ????? em?r, to say.

(??)?â??ph-Q?m??, e.g. ?????, ?ol??, sickness.

These ?â??phs, or at least the first two, stand especially under the four guttural letters (§

22 l), instead of a simple Šewâ mobile, since these letters by their nature require a more
definite vowel than the indeterminate simple Šewâ mobile. Accordingly a guttural at the
beginning of a syllable, where the Šewâ is necessarily vocal, can never have a mere Šewâ
simplex.

On ?? the shorter ?a?ef as compared with ?? cf. § 27 v.

Rem. A. Only ?? and ?? occur under letters which are not gutturals. ?a?eph-Patha? is found

instead of simple Šewâ (especially Šewâ mobile), chiefly (a) under strengthened consonants,
since this strengthening (commonly called doubling) causes a more distinct pronunciation of
the Šewâ mobile, ????? ?? branches, Zc 4:12. According to the rule given by Ben-Asher (which,
however, appears to be unknown to good early MSS. and is therefore rejected by Ginsburg,
Introd., p. 466; cf. Foote, Johns Hopkins Univ. Circulars, June 1903, p, 71 f.), the ?a?eph is
necessary1 when, in a strengthened medial consonant with Šewâ (consequently not in cases
like ???????, &c.), preceded by a Patha?, the sign of the strengthening (Dageš forte) has fallen
away, e.g. ??????? (but ed. Mant. and Ginsb. ?????? praise ye! ???????????? Ju 16:16; no less
universally, where after a consonant with Šewâ the same consonant follows (to separate them
more sharply, and hence with a Metheg always preceding), e.g.
Mant. and Ginsb. ?????? Gn 27:13 (but not without exceptions, e.g. ???????? Ju 5:15, Is 10:1; ???????
Jer 6:4, and so always ??????? behold me, ?????? behold us; on ?? before the suffix ??, see § 20 b); also
in certain forms under Kaph and Rêš after a long vowel and before the tone, e.g.
 Gn
????
????????
3:17; ???????? Ps 103:1;
 Ps 72:17, cf. Jer 4:2, 1 Ch 29:20, because
?
the tone is thrown back on to the ?. After ? Šewâ remains even before the tone, as ??????? &c.;
but before Maqqef ???????????? Baer Ex 4:18, 2 S 15:7 Jer 40:15, but ed. Mant., Jabl., Ginsb.
??????)2; (b) under initial sibilants after ? copulative, e.g. ??????? Gn 2:12; cf. Jer 48:20; ??????? Is
45:14; ??? ???? Lv 25:34; ??? ???? Gn 27:26; ??? ???? Nu 23:18, Is 37:17, Dn 9:18, cf. Ju 5:12, 1 K
14:21, 2 K 9:17, Jb 14:1, Ec 9:7—to emphasize the vocal character of the Šewâ. For the same
reason under the emphatic ? in ??????? Jer 22:28; cf. Jb 33:25; after Qôph in ??????????? (so Baer, but
ed. Mant., Jabl., Ginsb. ????) Ez 23:41; ???????? Ps 55:22; cf. Jer. 32:9; under Rêš in ???????? (ed.
Mant. ??????). Gn 18:21; ??????? Ps 28:9; even under ? Eze 26:21; under ? Est 2:8; ?????????? so Jabl.,
Ginsb., but ed. Mant. ??????? Dt 24:13; (c) under sonants, sibilants or Qôph after ??, e.g. ???????? Gn

B. The ?a?eph-Qame? is less restricted to the gutturals than the first two, and stands more
frequently for a simple Šewâ mobile when an original O-sound requires to be partly preserved,

 Jer 22:20, the ?a?eph-Qame? is no doubt due
??????
as in
to the influence of the following guttural as well as of the preceding U-sound. (Elsewhere
indeed after ? in similar cases ?a?eph-Patha? is preferred, see above, b; but with ??????? cf. also
?????? Is 9:3, 10:27, 14:25, where the U-sound must necessarily be admitted to have an
influence on the Šewâ immediately following.) In ???????? (û-?oh?r) Jb 17:9 it is also influenced
by the following O-sound. In ???????? 1 S 28:8 Qerê, the original form is ?????, where again the ?
represents an ?. It is only through the influence of a following guttural that we can explain the
forms ???????? Est 2:14; ???????? Pr 28:22; ????????? Jer 49:7; ?? ?????? Is 27:4; ????? ??????? Dn 8:13; ?????? ??
Ps 39:13; ?????????? 2 K 2:1 (Baer’s ed. also in ver. 11); ?????????? 2 Ch 34:12 (ed. Mant., Opitius,
&c. ?????). Finally in most of the examples which have been adduced, the influence of an
emphatic sound (?, ?, cf. also ????????? Ru 2:2, 7), or of a sibilant is also to be taken into account.

????

3. The sign of the simple Šewâ ?? serves also as a mere syllable divider. In this case

it is disregarded in pronunciation and is called Šewâ quiescens. In the middle of a
word it stands under every consonant which closes a syllable; at the end of words on
the other hand it is omitted except in final ? (to distinguish it better from final ?), e.g.
?????? king, and in the less frequent case, where a word ends with a mute after another
vowelless consonant as in ?????? nard, ??? thou fem. (for ’ant), ???????? thou fem. hast killed,
?? ?????? and he watered, ?? ?????? and he took captive, ?? ??????? drink thou not; but ???????, ?????.1

However, in the examples where a mute closes the syllable, the final Šewâ comes
somewhat nearer to a vocal Šewâ, especially as in almost all the cases a weakening era final
vowel has taken place, viz. ??? (cid:31)atte from ???? atte (anti), ???????? from
2nd sing. fern. perf. Qal, even ?????, after a vowel, Gn 16:8, Mi 4:10, &c., according to the
readings of Baer), ?? ???? yišbe from ??? ????, &c. The Arabic actually has a short vowel in
analogous forms. In ?????? borrowed from the Indian, as also in ?? ??? (q?š?) Pr 22:21; and in
????????? ne addas (for which we should expect
slight vowel sound.

) Pr 30:6 the final mute of itself attracts a

 (cf. in this form, the

?????

?????

Rem. The proper distinction between simple Šewâ mobile and quiescens depends on a
correct understanding of the formation of syllables (§ 26). The beginner may observe for the
present, that (1) Šewâ is always mobile (a) at the beginning of a word (except in ???? ??, ??? ?? §
97 b, note); (b) under a consonant with Dageš forte, e.g. ?????? gid-dephû; (c) after another Šewâ,
e.g. ???????? yiq?elû (except at the end of the word, see above, i). (2) Šewâ is quiescens (a) at the
end of a word, also in the ??; (b) before another Šewâ.

3 3 Ben-Asher requires ?? for ?? (even for Šewâ quiescens) generally before a guttural or
?; hence Baer reads in 2 S, 15:5 ?????????, Ps 18:7 ????????; 49:15 ??? ?????; 65:5 ????????;
68:24 ???????; Pr 30:17 ????????; Jb 29:25 ????????; cf. Delitzsch, Psalms, 12:7, note.
1 1 On ??? ?? as an ending of the 2nd sing. fem. perf. Qal of verbs ???, see § 75 m.

§ 11. Other Signs which affect the Reading.

Very closely connected with the vowel points are the reading-signs, which were

probably introduced at the same time. Besides the diacritical point over ? and ?, a
point is placed within a consonant to show that it has a stronger sound. On the other
hand a horizontal stroke (R?phè) over a consonant is a sign that it has not the stronger
sound. According to the different purposes for which it is used the point is either (1)
Dageš forte, a sign of strengthening (§ 12); or (2) Dageš lene, a sign of the harder
pronunciation of certain consonants (§ 13); or (3) Mapp??q, a sign to bring out the full
consonantal value of letters which otherwise serve as vowel letters (§ 7 b), especially
in the case of ? at the end of the word (§ 14 a). The R?phè, which excludes the
insertion of any of these points, has almost entirely gone out of use in our printed
texts (§ 14 e).

§ 12. Dageš in general,1 and Dageš forte in particular.

Cf. Graetz, ‘Die mannigfache Anwendung u. Bedeut. des Dagesch, ’ in Monatsschr. für
Gesch. u. Wiss. d. Judent., 1887, pp. 425 ff. and 473 ff.

1. Dageš, a point standing in the middle of a consonant,2 denotes, according to §
11, (a) the strengthening3 of a consonant (Dageš forte), e.g. ?????. qi???l (§ 20); or (b)
the harder pronunciation of the letters ??????????? (Dageš lene). For a variety of the latter,
now rarely used in our printed texts, see § 13 c.

The root ??? in Syriac means to pierce through, to bore through (with sharp iron); hence
the name Dageš is commonly explained, solely with reference to its form, by puncture, point.
But the names of all similar signs are derived rather from their grammatical significance.
Accordingly ??? may in the Masora have the sense: acuere (literam), i.e. to sharpen a letter,
as well as to harden it, i.e. to pronounce it as hard and without aspiration. ????? acuens
(literam) would then be a sign of sharpening and hardening (like Mapp??q ?????? proferens, as
signum prolationis), for which purposes a prick of the pen, or puncture, was selected. The
opposite of Dageš is ????? soft, § 14 e, and § 22 n.

2. In grammar Dages(cid:31) forte, the sign of strengthening, is the more important. It

may be compared to the sicilicus of the Latins (Lucul(cid:31)us for Lucullus) or to the
stroke over m(cid:31) and n(cid:31). In the unpointed textit is omitted, like the vowels and other
reading signs.

1 1 Oort, Theol. Tijdschr. 1902, p. 376, maintains that ‘the Masoretes recognized no
distinction between Dageš lene and forte. They used a Dageš where they considered
that a letter had the sharp, not the soft or aspirated sound.’ This may be true; but the
old-established distinction between the two kinds of Dageš is essential for the right
understanding of the grammatical forms.
2 2 W?w with Dageš (?) cannot in our printed texts be distinguished from a w?w
pointed as ?ûr?q (?); in the latter case the point should stand higher up. The ? û is,
however, easily to be recognized since it cannot take a vowel before or under it.
3 3 Stade, Lehrb. der hebr. Gr., Lpz. 1879, pp. 44, 103, rightly insists on the
expression strengthened pronunciation instead of the older term doubling, since the
consonant in question is only written once. The common expression arises from the
fact that in transcription a strengthened consonant can only be indicated by writing it
as double.

For the different kinds of Dageš forte, see § 20.

Ginsburg, Introd., p. 114 ff.: Dagesh and Raphe.

§ 13. Dageš lene.

1. Dageš lene, the sign of hardening, is in ordinary printed texts placed only
within the ??????????? letters (§ 6 n) as a sign that they should be pronounced with their
original hard sound (without aspiration), e.g. ?????? mèl?kh, but ?????? mal-kô; ????? t?phár,
but ??????? yith-p?r; ??? ?? š?th?, but ??? ???? yiš-tè.

2. The cases in which a Dageš lene is to be inserted are stated in § 21. It occurs
almost exclusively at the beginning of words and syllables. In the middle of the word
it can easily be distinguished from Dageš forte, since the latter always has a vowel
before it, whereas Dageš lene never has; accordingly the Dageš in ???? ’app??, ??????
rabb??m must be forte, but in ??????? yigdal it is lene.

A variety of the Dageš lene is used in many manuscripts, as well as in Baer’s editions,

though others (including Ginsburg in the first two cases, Introd., pp. 121, 130, 603, 662)
reject it together with the ?a?efs discussed in § 10 g. It is inserted in consonants other than the
Begadkephath to call attention expressly to the beginning of a new syllable: (a) when the same
consonantprecedes in close connexion, e.g. ??????????? Ps 9:2, where, owing to the Dageš, the
coalescing of the two Lameds is avoided; (b) in cases like ??????? Ps 62:8 = ma?-s?? (not m??a-
s??); (c) according to some (including Baer; not in ed. Mant.) in ??? in the combination ??? ??
Dt 32:5, or ?? ??? Hb 1:6, 2:6 &c. (so always also in Ginsburg’s text, except in Gn 38:9); see
also § 20 e and g.—Delitzsch appropriately gives the name of Dageš orthophonicum to this
variety of Dageš (Bibl. Kommentar, 1874, on Ps 94:12); cf. moreover Delitzsch, Luth. Ztschr.,
1863, p. 413; also his Complutensische Varianten zu dem Alttest. Texte, Lpz. 1878, p. 12##.

3. When Dageš forte is placed in a Begadkephath, the strengthening necessarily

excludes its aspiration, e.g. ????, from ??????.

§ 14. Mapp??q and R?phè.

1. Mapp??q, llke Dageš, also a point within the consonant, serves in the letters  ? ? ?

? as a sign that they are to be regarded as full consonants and not as vowel letters. In
most editions of the text it is only used in the consonantal ? at the end of words (since
? can never be a vowel letter in the middle of a word), e.g. ????? g?bháh (to be high),
?????? ar??h (her land) which has a consonantal ending (shortened from -h?), different
from

???????  ár?? (to the earth) which has a vowel ending.

Rem. 1. Without doubt such a H? was distinctly aspirated like the Arabic H? at the end of

a syllable. There are, however, cases in which this ? has lost its consonantal character (the
Mapp??q of course disappearing too), so that it remains only as a vowel letter; cf. § 91 e on the
3rd fem. sing.

The name ?????? means proferens, i.e. a sign which brings out the sound of the letter
distinctly, as a consonant. The same sign was selected for this and for Dageš, since both are
intended to indicate a hard, i.e. a strong, sound. Hence R?phè (see e) is the opposite of both.

2. In MSS. Mappîq is also found with ?, ?, ?, to mark them expressly as consonants, e.g. ????

, &c. For the various statements of the

(gôy), ???? (q?w, q?u), for which ?? is also used, as  ??????
Masora (where these points are treated as Dageš), see Ginsburg, The Massorah, letter ?, § 5
(also Introd., pp. 557, 609, 637, 770), and ‘The Dageshed Alephs in the Karlsruhe MS.’
(where these points are extremely frequent), in the Verhandlungen des Berliner Orientalisten-
Kongresses, Berlin, i. 1881, p. 136 ff. The great differences in the statements found in the
Masors point to different schools, one of which appears to have intended that every audible ?
should be pointed. In the printed editions the point occurs only four times with ? ( ??  or ??), Gn
43:26, Lv 23:17, Ezr 8:18 and Jb 33:21 (?????; where the point can be taken only as an
orthophonetic sign, not with König as Dageš forte). Cf. Delitzsch, Hiob, 2nd ed., p. 439 ff.

2. R?phè (????? i.e. weak, soft), a horizontal stroke over the letter, is the opposite of

both kinds of Dageš and Mapp??q, but especially of Dageš lene. In exact manuscripts
every ?????? letter has either Dageš lene or R?phè, e.g. ??????? mèl?kh, ??????? ???? ??. In
modern editions (except Ginsburg’s 1st ed.) R?phè is used only when the abseuce of a
Dageš or Mapp??q requires to be expressly pointed out.

Commentar’ on Psalms 1–3, in his Psalmencommentar of 1874, as well as the numerous
contributions to the accentual criticism of the text, &c., in the editions of Beer and
Delitzsch, and in the commentaries of the latter; W. Wickes, ???? ???? [Accents of the

1. As Prätorius (see above) has convincingly shown, the majority of the Hebrew
accents, especially, according to Kahle (see above), the ‘Conjunctivi’, were adopted
by the Jews from the neums and punctuation-marks found in Greek gospel-books,
and, like these, their primary purpose was to regulate minutely the public reading of
the sacred text. The complete transformation and amplification of the system (in three
different forms, see § 8 g, note), which soon caused the Jews to forget its real origin,
is clearly connected with the gradual change from the speaking voice in public

ZDMG. ZDMG. = Zeitschrift der deutschen morgenländischen Gesellschaft, Lpz.
1846 ff., since 1903 ed. by A. Fischer.

reading to chanting or singing. The accents then served as a kind of musical notes.1
Their value as such has, however, with the exception of a few traces, become lost in
transmission. On the other hand, according to their original design they have also a
twofold use which is still of the greatest importance for grammar land syntax), viz.
their value (a) as marking the tone, (b) as marks of punctuation to indicate the logical
(syntactical) relation of single words to their immediate surroundings, and thus to the
whole sentence.2

2. As a mark of the tone the accent stands almost invariably (but see below, e)
with the syllable which has the principal tone in the word. This is usually the ultima,
less frequently the penultima. Amongst the Jewish grammarians a word which has the
tone on the ultima is called Milra (Aram. ??????? i.e. accented below3), e.g.
 q??ál; a
word which has the tone on the penultima is Milêl (Aram. ????????, accented above), e.g.
?????  mèl?kh. Besides this, in many cases a secondary tone is indicated in the word by
????
? ???????
Mèth?g (cf. § 16). Examples such as
La 2:16) are regarded by the Jewish grammarians as even proparoxytone.4

 Is 50:8 (cf. 40:18, Ex 15:8, Jb 12:15,

???

3. As marks of interpunctuation the accents are subdivided into those which
separate (Distinctivi or Domini) and those which connect (Conjunctivi or Servi).
Further a twofold system of accentuation is to be noted: (a) the common system found
in twenty-one of the Books (the ??? i.e. twenty-one), and (b) that used in the first three
Books of the Hagiographa, viz. Psalms, Proverbs, and Job, for which the vox memor,
is ?????, from the initial consonants of the names, ???????? Psalms, ??? ???? Proverbs, ?????
Job, or more correctly, according to their original sequence, ???? (????? twin), so that
???? ???????? means the accents (sing. ?????) of these three Books. The latter system is not
only richer and more complicated in itself, but also musically more significant than
the ordinary accentuation.

The Common Accents.

Preliminary remark. The accents which are marked as prepositive stand to the right over

or under the initial consonant of the word; those marked as postpositive, to the left over or
under the last consonant. Consequently in both cases the tone-syllable must be ascertained
independently of the accent (but cf. below, l).

DISJUNCTIVE ACCENTS (Distinctivi OR Domini).1

1 1 On the attempts of Christian scholars of the sixteenth century to express the
Hebrew accents by musical notes, cf. Ortenberg, ZDMG.. 1889, p. 534.
2 2 At the same time it must not be forgotten that the value of the accent as a mark of
punctuation is always relative; thus, e.g. Athnâ? as regards the logical structure of the
sentence may at one time indicate a very important break (as in Gn 1:4); at another,
one which is almost imperceptible (as in Gn 1:1).
3 3 ‘Above’ in this sense means what comes before, ‘below’ is what comes after; cf.
Bacher, ZAW.. 1907, p. 285 f.
4 4 Cf. Delitzsch on Is 40:18.
1 1 All the disjunctives occur in Is 39:2.—The earlier Jewish accentuologists already
distinguish between ???????? Reges and ??????? ???? servi. The division of the disjunctive
accents into Imperatores, Reges, Duces, Comites, which became common amongst

1. (??) ????? Sillûq (end) always with the tone-syllable of the last word before

Sôph p?sûq (?), the verse-divider, e.g. ? ???????.

2. ( ?? ) ?????? Athnâ? or ??????????? Athna?t? (rest), the principal divider within the

verse.

3 a. ( ?? )  ?????????

?

 Segôlt?, postpositive, marks the fourth or fifth subordinate

division, counting backwards from Athnâ? (e.g. Gn 1:7, 28).

3 b. ( ??|  ) ??? ???? ?? Šalšèleth (i.e. chain), as disjunctive, or Great Šalšèleth,

distinguished by the following stroke2 from the conjunctive in the poetic

Christian grammarians, originated in the Scrutinium S. S. ex accentibus of Sam.
Bohlius, Rostock, 1636, and, as the source of manifold confusion, had better be given
up. The order of the accents in respect to their disjunctive power is shown in general
by the above classification, following Wickes. In respect to the height of tone (in
chanting) 1, 2, 5, 4, 8, which were low and long sustained notes, are to be
distinguished from the high notes (7, 3a, 6, 13, 9), and the highest (3b, 11, 12, 10); cf.
Wickes, ??? ?? p. 12 ff.—The name ???????? (later=accents in general) was originally
restricted to the disjunctives, see Kahle, 1. c., p. 169.
2 2 This stroke is commonly confused with Paseq, which has the same form. But
PaÆseµq (= restraining, dividing, also incorrectly called PesiÆq) is neither an
independent accent, nor a constituent part of other accents, but is used as a mark for
various purposes; see the Masoretic lists at the end of Baer’s editions, and Wickes,
Accents of the Twenty-one Books, p. 120 ff., where PaÆseµq is divided into
distinctivum, emphaticum, homonymicum, and euphonicum. The conjecture of
Olshausen (Lehrb., p. 86 f.), that Pâs?q served also to point out marginal glosses
subsequently interpolated into the text, has been further developed by E. yon
Ortenberg, ‘Die Bedeutung des Paseq für Quellenscheidung in den BB. d. A. T.,’ in
Progr. des Domgymn. zu Verden, 1887, and in the article, ‘Paseq u. Legarmeh, ’ in
ZAW.. 1887, p. 301 ff. (but see Wickes, ibid. 1888, p. 149 ff.; also E. Koönig, in the
Ztschr. f. kirchl. Wiss. u. kirchl. Leben, 1889, parts 5 and 6; Maas, in Hebraica, v. 121
ff., viii. 89 ff.). Praätorius, ZDMG.. 1899, p 683 ff., pointed out that Paseq (which is
pre-masoretic and quite distinct from Legarm?h) besides being a divider (used
especially for the sake of greater clearness) also served as a sign of abbreviation. For
further treatment of Paseq see H. Grimme, ‘Pasekstudien, ’ in the Bibl. Ztschr., i. 337
ff., ii. 28 ff., and Psalmenprobleme, &c., Freiburg (Switzerland), 1902, p. 173, where
it is argued that Paseq indicates variants in a difficult sentence; J. Kennedy, The Note-
line in the Heb. Scriptures, Edinb. 1903, with an index of all the occurrences of
Paseq, p. 117 ff. According to Kennedy the ‘note-line’, of which he distinguishes
sixteen different kinds, is intended to draw attention to some peculiarity in the text; it
existed long before the Masoretes, and was no longer understood by them. See,
however, the reviews of E. König, Theol. stud. u. Krit., 1904, p. 448 ff., G. Beer, TLZ.
1905, no. 3, and esp. A. Klostermann, Theol. Lit.-blatt, 1904, no. 13, with whom
Ginsburg agrees (Verhandlungen des Hamb. Or.-kongresses von 1902, Leiden, 1904,
p. 210 ff.) in showing that the tradition with regard to the 479 or 480 uses of Paseq is
by no means uniform. The purpose of Paseq is clearly recognizable in the five old
rules: as a divider between identical letters at the end and beginning of two words;
between identical or very similar words; between words which are absolutely

accentuation, is used for Segôlt? (seven times altogether) when this would
stand at the head of the sentence; cf. Gn 19:16, &c.

4 a. ( ?? ) ????? ????? Zâq?ph ?dôl, and

4 b. ( ?? ) ????? ????? Zâq?ph q??ôn. The names refer to their musical character. As a
disjunctive, Little Zâq?ph is by nature stronger than Great Zâq?ph; but if
they stand together, the one which comes first is always the stronger.

5. ( ?? ) ??????? ?iph?? or ??????? ?ar??, a subordinate disjunctive before Sillûq and
Athnâ?, but very often the principal disjunctive of the whole verse instead
of Athnâ?; always so when the verse consists of only two or three words

contradictory (as God and evil-doer); between words which are liable to be wrongly
connected; and lastly, between heterogeneous terms, as ‘Eleazar the High Priest, and

doubtful.—Cf. also the important article by H. Fuchs, ‘Pesiq ein Glossenzeichen, ’ in
the Vierteljahrsschrift f. Bibelkunde, Aug. 1908, p. 1 ff. and p. 97 ff.

REMARKS ON THE ACCENTS

As Signs of the Tone.

1. As in Greek and English (cf. ??µ? and ??µ?, cómpact and compáct) so also in Hebrew,

words which are written with the same consonants are occasionally distinguished by the
position of the tone, e.g.  ?????
qamá (standing up, fem.).

??????  qáma (she stood up),

 banú (they built),

 bánu (in us);

?????

??????

2. As a rule the accent stands on the tone-syllable, and properly on its initial consonant. In

the case of prepositives and postpositives alone (see above, e) the tone-syllable must be
ascertained independently of the accent. In many MSS. as well as in Baer’s editions of the
text, the postpositive sign in foretoned words stands also over the tone-syllable after the
analogy of Paš?? (see above, I. 8 a, note); e.g.
cases like

 Gn 19:4; so the prepositive sign in

 Gn 8:13.

???????

?????????

As Signs of Punctuation.

3. In respect to this use of the accents, every verse is regarded as a period which closes
with Sillûq, or in the figurative language of the grammarians, as a province (ditio) which is
governed by the great distinctive at the end. According as the verse is long or short, i.e. the
province great or small, there are several subordinate Domini of different grades, as governors
of greater and smaller divisions. When possible, the subdivisions themselves are also split up
into parts according to the law of dichotomy (see Wickes, The Accents of the Twenty-one
Books, p. 29 ff).—When two or more equivalent accents (Zâq?ph, Rebh??a) occur
consecutively, the accent which precedes marks a greater division than the one which follows;
cf. e.g. the Zâq?ph, Gn 120 a.

4. In general a conjunctive (Servus) unites only such words as are closely connected in

sense, e.g. a noun with a following genitive or a noun with an adjective. For the closest
connexion between two or more words Maqq?ph is added (§ 16 a).

5. The consecution of the several accents (especially the correspondence of disjunctives

with their proper conjunctives) conforms in the most minute details to strict rules, for a
further investigation of which we must refer to the above-mentioned works. Here, to avoid
misunderstanding, we shall only notice further the rule that in the accentuation of the books
????, the Rebh??a mugr?š before Sillûq, and the De??? before Athnâ?, must be changed into
conjunctives, unless at least two toneless syllables precede the principal disjunctive. For this
purpose Šewâ mobile after Qame?, Sere, or ?olem (with Metheg) is to be regarded as forming
a syllable. After Ôlè weyôr?d the Athnâ? does not necessarily act as pausal (cf. Delitzsch on
Ps 45:6). The condition of our ordinary texts is corrupt, and the system of accents can only be
studied in correct editions [see Wickes’ two treatises].

6. A double accentuation occurs in Gn 35:22, from ????? onward (where the later

accentuation, intended for public reading, aims at uniting vv. 22 and 23 into one, so as to pass
rapidly over the unpleasant statement in v. 22); and in the Decalogue, Ex 20:2 ff.; Dt 5:6 ff.
Here also the later (mainly superlinear) accentuation which closes the first verse with ?????
(instead of ???) is adopted simply for the purposes of public reading, in order to reduce the
original twelve verses (with sublinear accentuation) to ten, the number of the
Commandments. Thus ???????? at the end of v. 2 has Silluq (to closethe verse) in the lower
accentuation, but in the upper, which unites vv. 2–6 (the actual words of God) into a single
period, only Rebhia. Again ???, regarded as closing v. 3, is pointed ?????? (pausal Qame? with
Silluq), but in the upper accentuation it is ?????? with Patha? because not in pause. (Originally
there may have been a third accentuation requiring
and 3 as the first commandment.) Further the upper accentuation unites vv. 8–11 into one
period, while in vv. 12–15 the lower accentuation combines commandments 5–8 into one
verse. Cf. Geiger, Urschrift u. Übersetzungen der Bibel, p. 373; Japhet, op. cit., p. 158, and
esp. K. J. Grimm, Johns Hopkins Univ. Circ. xix (May, 1900), no. 145.

 and ??????, and thus representing vv. 2

?????????

§ 16. Of Maqq?ph and Mèth?g

These are both closely connected with the accents.

1. Maqq?ph (????? i.e. binder) is a small horizontal stroke between the upper part of

two words which so connects them that in respect of tone and pointing they are
regarded as one, and therefore have only one accent. Two, three, or even four words
may be connected in this way, e.g.
???? ???????????? all that he had, Gn 25:5.

 every man,

 every herb, Gn 1:29,

??????????

???????

?? ??

??

Certain monosyllabic prepositions and conjunctions, such as ???? to, ???? until, ???? upon,
???? with, ??? ne, ???? if, whether, ???? from, ???? lest, are almost always found with a following
Maqq?ph, provided they have not become independent forms by being combined with
prefixes, e.g. ?????, ?????, in which case Maqq?ph as a rule does not follow. Occasionally
Maqq?ph is replaced by a conjunctive accent (see above, § 9 u, 1 c), as, according to the
Masora, in Dt 27:9, 2 S 20:23, Jer 25:30, 29:25, Ec 9:4 in the case of
3:12 in the case of ????, the objective particle. Longer words are, however, connected by
Maqq?ph with a following monosyllable, e.g. ???????????????? Gn 6:9, ????????????? Gn 1:7; or two words
of more than one syllable, e.g. ? ??????????? ?? seventeen, Gn 7:11. Cf. the Greek proclitics ??, ??,
???, ??, ??, ??, which are atonic, and lean on the following word.

???? ? ; Ps 47:5, 60:2, Pr

???

2. Mètheg (

??????  i.e. a bridle), a small perpendicular stroke under the consonant to
the left of the vowel, indicates most frequently the secondary stress or counter-tone,
as opposed to the principal tone marked by the accents. It serves, however, in other
cases to point out that the vowel should not be hastily passed over in pronunciation,
but should be allowed its full sound. Hence other names of Mèth?g are Maar??kh, i.e.
lengthener, and Gay?, i.e. raising of the voice, which is Great Gay? with long
vowels, otherwise Little Gay?.1

It is divided into: 1. The light Mèth?g. This is subdivided again into (a) the ordinary
??????
??
??????????

Mèth?g of the counter-tone, as a rule in the second (open) syllable before the tone, e.g.
(cf. also such cases as ???????????); but also in the third when the second is closed, e.g.
???
(also in such cases as ???????????????), and when the third is not suitable for it, even in the fourth
(open) syllable before the tone. This Mèth?g may be repeated in the fourth syllable before the
tone, when it already stands in the second, e.g.
. Finally it is always added to the
vowel of an open ultima, which is joined by Maqq?ph to a word beginning with a toneless
?? ??
syllable and so without Mèth?g (e.g. ????? ???????????, on the on her hand
a word beginning with Šewâ before the tone-syllable, e.g.  ?????????
??
,  ??????????? ??
being to prevent the Šewâ from becoming quiescent.

, &c.; the object

, ????????????), or to

?????? ????

????? ??

???????

?

The ordinary light Mèth?g is omitted with a movable ? copulative, consequently we do not

find ????????, &c. (nor even ???????, &c., contrary to b, ?; but ???????, &c., according to b, ?, cf. § 10 g.
b).

(b) The firm or indispensable Mèth?g. (?) With all long vowels (except in certain cases, ?
copulative, see above), which are followed by a Šewâ mobile preceding the tone-syllable; e.g.
???????, ?? ?????, &c. (?) To emphasize a long vowel in a closed syllable immediately before
Maqq?ph, e.g. ?????? ?? Gn 4:25 (not š?th-l??); hence also with ????? Ps 138:2, and ????? Jb 41:26

through retraction of the tone, in order to prevent its being pronounced as Seghôl, e.g.
???
??????  Pr 12:1 (not ôh?bh). (?) With all vowels before composite Šewâ, e.g. ????????, ?????????, &c.
(except when the following consonant is strengthened, e.g.
strengthening by Dageš excludes the retarding of the vowel by Mèth?g); so in the cases
discussed in § 28 c, where a short vowel has taken the place of a ?a?eph, as ?????????, &c. (?) In
the preformative syllable of all forms of ????? to be, and ????? to live, when Šewâ quiescens stands
under the ? or ?, e.g. ????????, ???????? (yih-yè, ti?-yè), &c., cf. § 63 q. (?) With the Qame? of the

2. The grave Mèth?g (Gay? in the more limited sense) is especially employed in the
following cases in order more distinctly to emphasize a short vowel or an initial Šewâ: (a)
with the Patha? of the article or of the prefixes ?, ?  , ?, when followed by Šewâ under a
consonant without Dageš, e.g. ??????????, ??????????, &c., but not before ?? (before which ?? also
remains without Mèth?g, with the exception of ???????? and ????????, when they are followed by
Maqq?ph, or accented with Paš??), nor before the tone-syllable of a word, and neither before
nor after the common Mèth?g; likewise not in words which are connected by a conjunctive
accent with the following word; (b) with the interrogative ?? with Patha? (except when it
precedes ??, Dageš forte or the tone-syllable of the word), e.g. ?????????. When a Šewâ follow the ??
and after the Šewâ there is an untoned syllable, Baer places the Mèth?g to the right of the
Patha?, e.g. ?????????? Gn 27:38 (but ed. Mant. and Ginsb. ?????); (c) with the Patha? or Segol of
??????? .—The Šewâ-Gay?
the article before a guttural (which cannot take Dageš), e.g. ?????????,
 ???(
 is especially important in the accentuation of the ????, for purposes of musical recitation;
it stands chiefly in words whose principal tone is marked by a disjunctive without a preceding
conjunctive, e.g. ????????? Ps 1:3.

??

)

3. The euphonic Gay?, to ensure the distinct pronunciation of those consonants which in

consequence of the loss of the tone, or because they close a syllable, might easily be
neglected, e.g.
?????
?? ????
???????
?
?????????? Jb 33:4, &c.; ? ??????? Gn 1:11.

y??-reû (they fear), but  ?????
 yirû (they see), ?? ????? (they sleep), but ?? ???? (they repeat). The
Jewish grammarians, however, do not consider the syllables lengthened by Mèth?g as
open. They regard the Šewâ as quiescent in cases like ???????, and belonging to the
preceding vowel; cf. Baer, Thorat Emeth, p. 9, and in Merx’s Archiv, i. p. 60, Rem. 1,
and especially Dikduke ha-?eamim, p. 13.

§ 17. Of the Qerê and Keth??bh. Masora marginalis and finalis

On Qerê and Keth??bh see Ginsburg, Intr., p. 183 ff.]

1 1 The common form is
according to Qim?i, the tone is always to be placed on the former. For the above
mode of writing and position of the tone cf. Is 38:3, Jon 1:14, 4:2, Ps 116:4.

, with an accent on both syllables, in which case,

????(cid:31)?

1. The margin of Biblical MSS. and editions exhibits variants of an early date (§ 3
c), called ?????2 to be read, since, according to the opinion of the Jewish critics, they are
to be preferred to the ??????, i.e. what is written in the text, and are actually to be read
instead of it.

On this account the vowels of the marginal reading (the Qerê) are placed under the

consonants of the text, and in order to understand both readings properly, the vowels
in the text must be applied to the marginal reading, while for the reading of the text
(the Keth??bh) its own vowels are to be used. Thus in Jer 42:6 ?????? occurs in the text, in
the margin ??? ?????. Read ???? we (or according to Jewish tradition ???) in the text, in
the margin
. A small circle or asterisk in the text always refers to the marginal
reading.

?????

????

2. Words or consonants which are to be passed over in reading, and are therefore
left unpainted, are called ????? ????? ?????? (scriptum et non legendum), e.g. ?? Jer 38:16,
?? 39:12, ???? 51:3. Conversely, words not contained in the text, but required by the
Masora (as indicated by the insertion of their vowels), are called ?????? ????? ?????, e.g. 2 S
8:3, Jer 31:38. See further Strack, Prolegomena Critica, p. 85; Dikduke ha-?eamim, §§
62, 64; Blau, Masoretische Untersuchungen, p. 49 ff.

3. In the case of some very common words, which are always to be read otherwise

than according to the Keth??bh, it has not been considered necessary to place the Qerê
in the margin, but its vowels are simply attached to the word in the text. This Qerê
perpetuum occurs in the Pentateuch in ???? (Qerê ????) wherever ??? stands for the
feminine (§ 32 l), and in ??????? (Keth??bh ???, Qerê ????????) always, except in Dt 22:19 (but
the Sam. text always has ???, ????). The ordinary explanation of this supposed
archaism, on the analogy of Greek ? ???? and ? ????, our child, is inadequate, since
there is no trace elsewhere of this epicene use; ??? for ???? is rather a survival of a
system of orthography in which a final vowel was written defectively, as in ????????; cf. §
2 n.–Other instances are: ????????? (Q. ????????) Gn 30:18 &c., see the Lexicon., and Baer
and Delitzsch, Genesis, p. 84, and below, note to § 47 b; ???? ??????? (Q.
properly ??? ???????; ??????? (Q. ??????? the Lord), or (after ???????) ??????? (Q. ????????) properly ???????

4. The masoretic apparatus accompanying the biblical text is divided into (a)
Masora marginalis, consisting of (?) Masora (marginalis) magna on the upper and
lower margins of MSS.; (?) Masora (marginalis) parva between and on the right and
left of the columns; (b) Massora finalis at the end of the several books, counting
Samuel, Kings, Minor Prophets, Ezra-Nehemiah, Chronicles, each as one book. On all
three varieties see especially Ginsburg, Introd., p. 423 ff., and the appendices
containing (p. 983 ff.) the masoretic treatise from the St. Petersburg MS. of A.D. 1009,
and (p. 1000 ff.) specimens of the Masora parva and magna on two chapters.

CHAPTER II

PECULIARITIES AND CHANGES OF LETTERS: THE SYLLABLE AND THE
TONE

§ 18.

THE changes which take place in the forms of the various parts of speech, depend
partly on the peculiar nature of certain classes of letters and the manner in which they
affect the formation of syllables, partly on certain laws of the language in regard to
syllables and the tone.

§ 19. Changes of Consonants

The changes which take place among consonants, owing to the formation of

words, inflexion, euphony, or to influences connected with the progress of the
language, are commutation, assimilation, rejection, addition, transposition, softening.

1. Commutation1 may take place between consonants which are either homorganic

or homogeneous (cf. § 6 q), e.g. ?????,  ????? , ????? to exult, ????, ?????, Aram. ????? to be
weary, ????? and ????? to press, ????? and ????? to close, ????? and ????? to escape. In process of
time, and partly under the influence of Aramaic, the harder and rougher sounds
especially were changed into the softer, e.g. ????? into ??? ?? to laugh, ????? into ???? to
reject, and the sibilants into the corresponding mutes: ? into ?, ? into ?, ? into ?. In
many cases these mutes may be regarded as a return to an earlier stage of the
pronunciation.

The interchange of consonants, however, belongs rather to the lexicographical
treatment of stems2 than to grammatical inflexion. To the latter belong the interchange
(a) of ? and ? in Hithpa?l (§ 54 b); (b) of ? and ? in verbs primae Yôd (§ 69), ????? for
?????, &c.

2. Assimilation usually takes place when one consonant which closes a syllable
passes over into another beginning the next syllable, and forms with it a strengthened
letter, as illustris for inlustris, affero for adfero, ?????µ???? for ?????µ????. In
Hebrew this occurs,

(a) most frequently with ? , e.g. ?????? (for min-š?m) from there, ????? (for min-zè)

from this, ????? (for yint?n) he gives. ?  is not assimilated after the prefix ??, e.g.  ???????
as a rule before gutturals (except sometimes before ?), nor when it is the third
consonant of the stem, e.g.
 for n?thánt?) except when another
 (cf. however
Nun follows, cf. § 44 o; nor in some isolated cases, as Dt 33:9, Is 29:1, 58:3, all in the
principal pause; on  ??????

 and ??????? Ps 68:3, see § 51 k, and § 66 f.

?? ???????

, nor

???????

?

1 1 Cf. Barth, Etymologische Forschungen, Lpz. 1893, p. 15 ff.
(‘Lautverschiebungen’).
2 2 See in the Lexicon., the preliminary remarks on the several consonants.

(b) Less frequently and only in special cases with ?, ?, ?, e.g. ????? (for yilqa?) he
takes; ??????? for mithdabb?r; ??????? for yith?amm?; ??????? for tithkôn?n; ???????? for ??????????;
?????

 for a?adt; but in 1 S 4:19 for ????? read probably

.
????????

(c) In isolated cases with ?, ?, ?, e.g. ????? prithee! if from ??? ??; ? and ? mostly

before sibilants in the verbal forms enumerated in § 71.

In all these cases, instead of the assimilated letter, a Dageš forte appears in the
following consonant. Dageš, however, is omitted when the strengthened consonant
would stand at the end of a word, since the strengthening would then be less audible
(§ 20 l), e.g. ?? nose (from anp), ??? to give (from tint).

The cases are less frequent where a weak letter is lost in pronunciation,1 and in place of it
 (§ 59 g).

the preceding stronger sound is sharpened, i.e. takes Dageš, e.g.
????? for ??????? (§ 66 e) is an Aramaism.

?????????

 from

???????

????

3. Complete rejection takes place only in the case of weaker consonants,

especially the sonants ?  and ?, the gutturals ? and ?, and the two half vowels ? and ?.
Such rejection takes place,

(a) at the beginning of a word (aphaeresis), when these weak consonants (?, ?, ?,
; ???

? ) are not supported by a full vowel, but have only Šewâ, e.g.
for ?????; ??? for ?????; ??? for ?????, ??? for ????? Ez 2:10.

????  we, also

?????

????

???

??????

Aphaeresis of a weak consonant with a full vowel is supposed to occur in  ???  Ju 19:11 for
; in ??? for ????? Je 42:10; on ??? Ez 17:5 for ?????, and on ????? Ho

?????; in
11:3 for ???????, see § 66 g, end. In reality, however, all these forms are to be regarded merely
as old textual errors.

 2 S 22:41 for

????????

(b) In the middle of a word (syncope), when Šewâ precedes the weak consonant2;
thus in the case of ? (see further § 23 b–f, and § 68 b–k), e.g. in ??? for ?????. As a rule
in such cases, however, the ? is orthographically retained, e.g. ???????? for
Syncope occurs frequently in the case of ?, e.g.
???????? for ?????????? (§ 53 a).

???? .
????
 (§ 23 k and § 35 n),

??????(cid:31)????

?????????

 for

Syncope of ? with Šewâ occurs in such cases as ????????? for ?????????? (cf. § 102 m);
? ??????? Zc 11:5.1 On the cases in which ? is wholly omitted after the article, see § 35 d.

Finally, the elision of ? and ? in verbs ??? (§ 75 h) is an instance of syncope.—On

the syncope of ? between two vowels, see § 23 k.

1 1 Such a suppression of a letter is sometimes inaccurately called ‘backward
assimilation’.
2 2 Syncope of a strong consonant (?) occurs in ??? prithes ! if this stands for ????? (see
Lexicon.), also in ?????? Am 8:8, Keth?(cid:31)bh for ????? ?????? (cf. ?????? ???? 9:5), and in ????? Jos
19:3 for
as is undoubtedly ????? Am 8:8 for ??????? (95).
1 1 Frensdorff, Ochla Wochla, p. 97 f., gives a list of forty-eight words with quiescent
?.

???????  (as in 15:29). Probably, however, ????? and ??? are only clerical errors,

:

(c) At the end of a word (apocope), e.g. ????? pr. name of a city (cf. ?????????

Gilonite); ???????, where ? though really rejected is orthographically retained, &c. On the
apocope of ? and ? in verbs ????, see § 24 g, and § 75 a.

Bolder changes (especially by violent apocope), took place in earlier periods of the

language, notably the weakening of the feminine ending ? ?? ?th to ? ?? ?, see § 44 a, and § 80 f.

4. To avoid harshness in pronunciation a helping sound, Aleph prosthetic2 with its

vowel, is prefixed to some words, e.g. ???????? and ?????? arm (cf. ????, ?????; spiritus,
French esprit).—A prosthetic ? occurs probably in ??????? scorpion; cf. Arab. u?fûr bird
(stem ?afara).

5. Transposition3 occurs only seldom in the grammar, e.g. ????? ???? for ??? ?????? (§ 54

b) for the sake of euphony; it is more frequent in the lexicon (
????? ?? and ????? ?? garment), but is mostly confined to sibilants and sonants.

??????  and

???? ??  lamb,

6. Softening occurs e.g. in ????? star, from kaukabh=kawkabh for kabhkabh (cf.

Syriac raurab=rabrab);  ???????
common opinion, also in  ????? man from inš, cf. however § 96.

1. The strengthening of a consonant, indicated by Dageš forte, is necessary and

essential (Dageš necessarium)

(a) when the same consonant would be written twice in succession without an

intermediate vowel or Šewâ mobile; thus we have
????? .
???

???????

 for

????

?????

 n?th?n-nû and

??????  for

(b) in eases of assimilation (§ 19 b–f), e.g.  ?????

 for yint?n.

In both these cases the Dageš is called compensativum.

(c) When it is characteristic of a grammatical form, e.g. ????? he has learned, ????? he
has taught (Dageš characteristicum). In a wider sense this includes the cases in which
a consonant is sharpened by Dageš forte, to preserve a preceding short vowel (which
in an open syllable would have to be lengthened by § 26 e), e.g. ???????? camels for
gem?l??m; cf. § 93 ee and kk, § 93 pp.

This coaleseing of two consonants as indicated above does not take place when the first
has a vowel or Šewâ mobile. In the latter case, according to the correct Masora, a compound
Šewâ should be used, preceded by Meth?g, e.g. ?????????, ????????, &c. (cf. §§ 10 g, 16 f). This
 Gn 27:4, but the first ?   has a vocal Šewâ,
pointing is not used before the suffix ??, e.g.  ???????????
?
otherwise the second ?   would have Dageš lene. Also when the former of the two consonants

2 2 This awkward term is at any rate as suitable as the name Alef protheticum
proposed by Nestle, Marginalien u. Materialien, Tübingen, 1893, p. 67 ff.

f. wissenschaftliche Theologie, 1894, p. 451 ff.

has been already strengthened by Dageš forte, it can only have a vocal Šewâ, and any further
contraction is therefore impossible. This applies also to cases where Dageš forte has been
omitted (see below, m, e.g. ??????? properly ??????=hal-lelû. The form
)
??????????
might be explained as imperat. Pi?l= ??????????
; if it were imperat. Qal the non-contraction of the
monosyllabic root would be as strange as it is in ???? ?? Jer 49:28, and in the imperf. ????? ???? Jer
5:6.

 Ps 9:14 (not

???????????

2. A consonant is sometimes strengthened merely for the sake of euphony (Dageš

euphonicum), and the strengthening is then not so essential. This occurs1—

(a) when two words are closely united in pronunciation by Dageš forte

conjunctivum: (1) in the first letter of a monosyllable or of a word having the tone (or
occasionally the counter-tone) on the first syllable,2 when closely connected with the
preceding word, if that word ends in a tone-bearing Qame? (? ??) with Šewâ mobile
preceding, or a tone-bearing ? ??, —called ?????? (i.e. compressed) by the Jewish
grammarians.

The term monosyllable here and in f (by § 28 e) includes Segholates like

?????? ,

??????

, &c.,

as well as forms like ?????, ??? ??, ?? ??, and even

.
????????

Some limit the use of the De???q to the closest connexion of a monosyllable with a

following Begadkephath. However, it also applies to cases like ????????? Nu 22:6; ????????????? Gn
2:23; ???????????? Ps 91:11; and even with Rêš, ????????????? Pr 15:1;
 Gn 43:15. In all these
examples the tone, were it not for the Maqq?ph, would be on the ultima of the first word.

?????? ??????

????

Rem. 1. When ??? this has Maqq?ph after it, a Dageš forte conj. always follows, even if the

next word is neither a monosyllable nor has the tone on the initial syllable; thus not only in
??????????? Jer 23:6, but also in ????????????? Nu 13:27, 1 Ch 22:1. In
Maqq?ph is represented by a conjunctive accent, § 9 u, 1 c, and § 16 b), the Seghôl coincides
with the secondary tone-syllable. On the origin of Dag. f. conj. after ???? (for ???) what?, see §
37 b, c.

(2) In the first letter of a monosyllable, or of a word with the tone on the first
syllable after a closely connected milêl ending in ? ?? or ? ??. Such a milêl is called by
the Jewish grammarians ????????? ???? (Aram.=Heb. ???????? ?????) veniens e longinquo (in
respect of the tone). The attraction of the following tone-syllable by Dageš forte conj.
is here also due to the exigencies of rhythm, e.g.
118:25 (so ed. Mant., but Ginsburg and Kittel

 Ps

first word Metheg, in the secondary tone, takes the place of the accent, cf. ???????? ???? Gn
1:12; ????????????? Gn 32:30, &c. Finally, the Dageš is used when the attracted word does

whether we should include here those cases in which Dageš forte occurs after a word ending
in a toneless û, such as

19:2, 1 S 8:19; ?? Ju 18:19, Est 6:13 (where P. Haupt regards the Dageš as due to the enclitic
character of the ??); ????? Ho 8:10;
these examples not as conjunctive, but orthophonic (see above, § 13 c, and Delitzsch,
Psalmen, 4th ed. on Ps 94:12 a), we especially had in view those cases in which the consonant
with Dageš has a Šewâ. The extension of the use of Dageš to consonants with a strong vowel,
seems, however, to indicate that these are cases of the ????????? ????, which was required by some
Masoretes but not consistently inserted. On the other hand, the Dageš forte in ? after a
preceding ?? (Ps 118:5, 18), and even after û (Ps 94:12), is due to an attempt to preserve its
consonantal power; see König, Lehrgeb., p. 54 b.

(b) When a consonant with Šewâ is strengthened by Dageš forte dir??mens to make

the Šewâ more audible. In almost all cases the strengthening or sharpening can be
easily explained from the character of the particular consonant, which is almost
always a sonant, sibilant, or the emphatic Qôph; cf. ??????? Lv 25:5, Dt 32:32 (for ???????);
?????????? Is 33:1 (where, however, ??????????? is to be read); cf. Na 3:17, Jb 9:18, 17:2, Jo
1:17 (with ?  ); Is 57:6 (with ?); Ju 20:43, 1 1 S 1:6 (with ?); Gn 49:10, 17 (and so
always in ??????? Ju 5:22, Ct 1:8 and ??????? Ps 77:20, 89:52); Ex 15:17, Dt 23:11, Ju
20:32, 1 S 28:10 (?)2; Ex 2:3, Is 58:3, Am 5:21, Ps 141:3, Pr 4:13 (?  ); Pr 27:25 (?); Is
5:28, Ps 37:15, Jer 51:56, Neh 4:7 (?). Also, with ?   Ho 3:2; with ? Is 9:3, Jer 4:7; with
? 1 S 10:11. In many instances of this kind the influence of the following consonant is
also observable.

(c) When a vowel is to be made specially emphatic, generally in the principal
pause, by a Dageš forte affectuosum in the following consonant. Thus in a following
sonant, Ju 5:7 (

3. Omission of the strengthening, or at least the loss of the Dageš forte occurs,

(a) almost always at the end of a word, since here a strengthened consonant
cannot easily be sounded.1 In such cases the preceding vowel is frequently lengthened
(§ 27 d), e.g. ??? multitude, from ???; ??? people, with a distinctive accent or after the
article, ???, from ???; but e.g. ??? garden, ??? daughter, with the final consonant
virtually sharpened. On the exceptions ??? thou (fem.) and
Ez 16:33, see § 10 k.

 thou (fem.) hast given

???????

(b) Very frequently in certain consonants with Šewâ mobile, since the absence of a
strong vowel causes the strengthening to be less noticeable. This occurs principally in
the case of ? and ? (on ?? and ?? after the article, see § 35 b; on ?? after ????, § 37 b); and in
the sonants ?  , 2 ?  and ?; also in the sibilants, especially when a guttural follows (but
note Is 62:9, ?????????, as ed. Mant. and Ginsb. correctly read, while Baer has ??????? with
compensatory lengthening, and others even ??????; ????? ???? Gn 27:28, 39; ?? ???? 38:24 for

Of the Begadkephath letters, ? occurs without Dageš in ???????? Ju 8:2; ? in ????????????
Ez 32:30; ? in ??????? Is 11:12 56:8, Ps 147:2 (not in Jer 49:36), supposing that it is the

preformative ?? in the imperf. of verbs),
??????? , ???????, ??????, ???????, ?? ????, ??????,

stroke (§ 14) over the consonant. However, in these cases, we must assume at least a
virtual strengthening of the consonant (Dageš forte implicitum, see § 22 c, end).

(c) In the Gutturals, see § 22 b.

§ 21. The Aspiration of the Tenues.1

The harder sound of the six Begadkephath letters, indicated by a Dageš lene, is to
be regarded, according to the general analogy of languages, as their older and original
pronunciation, from which the softer sound was weakened (§ 6 n and § 13). The
original hard sound is maintained when the letter is initial, and after a consonant, but
when it immediately follows a vowel or Šew? mobile it is softened and aspirated by
their influence, e.g. ????? p?ra?, ??????? yiphr??, ??? k?l, ????? lekh?l. Hence the
Begadkephath take Dageš lene

(1) at the beginning of words: (a) without exception when the preceding word
 al-k?n (therefore), ????? ??? ?? per?? (fruit-
ends with a vowelless consonant, e.g.  ??????
tree); (b) at the beginning of a section, e.g. ?? ??????? Gn 1:1, or at the beginning of a
sentence, or even of a minor division of a sentence after a distinctive accent (§ 15 d),
although the preceding word may end with a vowel. The distinctive accent in such a
 and it
case prevents the vowel from influencing the following tenuis, e.g.
was so, that when, Ju 11:5 (but ???????????? Gn 1:7).

? ??????? ?

Rem. 1. The vowel letters ?, ?, ?, ?, as such, naturally do not close a syllable. In close

??? ???

???? ?????  Ps 68:18), and by ? with Mapp??q; hence e.g. there is Dageš lene in

other hand, syllables are closed by the consonantal ? and ? (except

2. In a number of cases Dageš lene is inserted, although a vowel precedes in close
connexion. This almost always occurs with the prefixes ?? and ??   in the combinations ???, ???
(i.e. when a Begadkephath with Šewâ precedes the same or a kindred aspirate) and ??? (see
Baer, L. Psalmorum, 1880, p. 92, 2 on Ps 23:3); cf. e.g. 1 S 25:1, Is 10:9, Ps 34:2, Jb 19:2; ???
is uncertain; ???, ???, and ???
according to the Dikduke ha-?eeamim, p. 30. Sometimes the Begadkephath letters, even with a
full vowel, take Dageš before aspirant (and even before ? in ??????????? 1 K 12:32); cf. the
instances mentioned above, § 20 e (mostly tenues before ?). In all these cases the object is to
prevent too great an accumulation of aspirates. The LXX, on the other hand, almost always
represent the ?   and ?  , even at the beginning of a syllable, by ? and ?; ??????, ????????,

German in König’s Lehrgeb., i. p. 62).

????????? Jos 15:56 may perhaps be due to the character of the ?.

On ????????, ?? ?????? and similar forms, see § 10 i.

Whether Šewâ be vocal and consequently causes the aspiration of a following tenuis,

depends upon the origin of the particular form. It is almost always vocal

(a) When it has arisen from the weakening of a strong vowel, e.g. ?????? pursue ye (not
??????) from ?????; ??????? (not ???????), because originally m?l?khê, but ??????? from the ground-form
malk.

(b) With the ?   of the pronominal suffixes of the 2nd pers. ?? ??, ??? ??, ??? ??, since Šewâ mobile

is characteristic of these forms (see § 58 f; § 91 b).

Rem. Forms like

?? ???????

§ 22. Peculiarities of the Gutturals.

The four gutturals ?, ?, ?, ?, in consequence of their peculiar pronunciation, have

special characteristics, but ?, as the weakest of these sounds, and sometimes also ?
(which elsewhere as one of the harder gutturals is the opposite of ?), differ in several
respects from the stronger ? and ?.

1. They do not admit of Dageš forte, since, in consequence of a gradual

weakening of the pronunciation (see below, note 2), the strengthening of the gutturals
was hardly audible to the Masoretes. But a distinction must be drawn between (a) the
complete omission of the strengthening, and (b) the mere echo of it, commonly called
half doubling, but better, virtual strengthening.

In the former case, the short vowel before the guttural would stand in an open
syllable, and must accordingly be lengthened or modified.2 For a distinction must
again be drawn between the full lengthening of Patha? into Qame?—mostly before ?
(always under the ? of the article, see § 35), as a rule also before ?, less frequently
before ?, and least often before ?—and the modification of Patha? to Seghôl, mostly
before a guttural with Qame?. In the other case (virtual strengthening) the Dageš is
still omitted, but the strengthening is nevertheless regarded as having taken place, and
the preceding vowel therefore remains short. This virtual strengthening occurs most
frequently with ?, usually with ?, less frequently with ?, and very seldom with ?.
Examples of (a) ?????, ???????, ?????, ?????, ???????? (for yi???bh?); also ?????, ?????, ?????????, ????????
(see more fully on the pointing of the article before ? in § 35).—Of (b)
(from min?û?), ?????, ?????, ?????, &c.—In all these cases of virtual strengthening the
Dageš forte is to be regarded at least as implied (hence called Dageš forte implicitum,
occultum, or delitescens).

????????

, ?????

2. They prefer before them, and sometimes after them (cf. h), a short A-sound,

because this vowel is organically the nearest akin to the gutturals. Hence

2 2 Cf. terra and the French terre, the Gorman Rolle and the French rôle; German
drollig and French drôle. The omission of the strengthening shows a deterioration of
the language. Arabic still admits of the strengthening of gutturals in all cases.

(b) After a heterogeneous long vowel, i.e. after all except Qame?, the hard
gutturals1 (consequently not ?), when standing at the end of the word, require the
insertion of a rapidly uttered ? (Patha? furtivum) between themselves and the vowel.
This Patha? is placed under the guttural, but sounded before it. It is thus merely an
orthographic indication not to neglect the guttural sound in pronunciation, e.g. ????
rûa?, ????, ????, ????? ????, ??????, (when consonantal ? is final it necessarily takes Mapp??q), but
e.g. ?????, &c., since here the rapidly uttered ? is no longer heard.

Iach for ich, &c., in some Swiss dialects of German, is analogous; a furtive Patha? is here

involuntarily intruded before the deep guttural sound. In Arabic the same may be heard in
such words as mes??a?, although it is not expressed in writing. The LXX (and Jerome, cf.
ZAW. iv. 79) write ?, sometimes ?, instead of furtive Patha?, e.g. ???? ???, ?????? ’??????? (also
’??????).

Rem. 1. The guttural may also have an influence upon the following vowel, especially in
??????

 (not p??l) deed. The only exceptions are

??????  (not na?r) a youth,

Segholate forms, e.g.
?????, ?????, ?????, ?????.

2. Where in the present form of the language an ??, whether original or attenuated from
Patha?, would stand before or after a guttural in the first syllable of a word, a Seghôl as being
between ? and ?? is frequently used instead, e.g. ??????? (also ???????), ??????, ???????, ???????, ???????, &c.

On the other hand, the slighter and sharper ?ireq is retained even under gutturals when

the following consonant is sharpened by Dageš forte, e.g.
sharpening is removed, Seghôl is again apt to appear, e.g. ??????? constr. ???????, ??????? constr. ???????.

????? , ?????, ?????; but when this

3. Instead of simple Šewâ mobile, the gutturals take without exception a compound

Šewâ, e.g. ????? ??,

??????? , ?????, ?????, &c.

1 1 Prätorius, Ueber den rückweich. Accent im Hebr., Halle, 1897, p. 17, &c., remarks
that Patha? furtivum has not arisen merely under the influence of the guttural, but is
due to a duplication of the accented syllable, so that e.g. ?? ????,  ?????
pronounced yasîibh, ya?ûudh although the short intermediate vowel was not so
noticeable as before a guttural.
ZAW. ZAW, = Zeitschrift für die alttestamentliche Wissenschaft, ed. by B. Stade,
Giessen, 1881 ff., and since 1907 by K. Marti.

 would also be

4. When a guttural with quiescent Šewâ happens to close a syllable in the middle
of a word, the strongly closed syllable (with quiescent Šewâ) may remain; necessarily
so with ?, ?, and ? at the end of the tone-syllable, e.g.
????????? , but also before the
tone (see examples under i), even with ?.

?? ???????

,

But in the syllable before the tone and further back, the closed syllable is

generally opened artificially by a ?a?eph (as being suited to the guttural) taking the
place of the quiescent Šewâ, and in particular that ?a?eph which repeats the sound of
the preceding vowel, e.g. ??????? (also ???????); ???????? (also ???????); ??????? p?olô (for p?lô).
But when, owing to a flexional change, the strong vowel following the ?a?eph is
weakened into Šewâ mobile, then instead of the ?a?eph its fall vowel is written, e.g.
????????? (from ????????), ?????????, ????????? (from ?????). The original forms, according to § 28 c,
were yamedhû, neremû, p?lekh?. Hence ?????????, &c., are really only different
orthographic forms of ?????????, &c., and would be better transcribed by yaamedhû, &c.

Rem. 1. On the use of simple or compound Šewâ in guttural verbs, see further §§ 62–65.

2. Respecting the choice between the three ?a?ephs, it may be remarked:

(a) ?, ?, ? at the beginning of a syllable prefer ??, but ? prefers ??, e.g. ????? ass, ????? to kill,
????? to say; when farther from the tone syllable, however, the ?? even under ? changes into the
 to you, ????? to eat, but ?????? (akh?l, toneless on
lighter ??, e.g. ????? (poetic for ????) to, but
account of Maqq?ph). Cf. § 27 w. The 1st pets. sing. imperf. Pi?l regularly has ??. Likewise ?? is
naturally found under ? in cases where the ?a?eph arises from a weakening of an original ?
(e.g. ????? lion, ground-form ary), and ?? if there be a weakening of an original u (e.g. ????? a fleet,
????? affliction, cf. § 93 q, z).

???????

??

(b) In the middle of a word after a long vowel, a ?a?eph-Patha? takes the place of a

5. The ?, which in sound approximates to the gutturals (§ 6 g), shares with the

gutturals proper their first, and to a certain extent their second, peculiarity, viz.

(a) The exclusion of the strengthening, instead of which the preceding vowel is

almost always lengthened, e.g. ?????? he has blessed for birrakh, ?????? to bless for
barr?kh.

(b) The preference for ? as a preceding vowel, e.g. ??????? and he saw (from ???????);

????????  both for

????????  and he turned back, and for

????????  and he caused to turn back.

The exceptions to a are ????? m?rr?th, Pr 14:10; ????? kh?rr?th and ???? ?? š?rr?kh, Ez 16:4
(cf. Pr 3:8); ? ????? ?? Ct 5:2; ????????? 1 S 1:6; ?????????? 1 S 10:24, 17:25, 2 K 6:32; exceptions to b
are
 Ju 20:43 (cf. § 20 h); ??????? 1 S 23:28, 2 S 18:16; also on account of ???? (§ 20 c),
Pr 15:1, 20:22, 2 Ch 26:10; and on account of ????? ??? (§ 20 f) 1 S 15:6, Jer 39:12, Ps 52:5,
Hb 3:13, Pr 11:21, Jb 39:9, Ezr 9:6. A kind of virtual strengthening (after ??   for ???) is found in
??????????? Is 14:3. In Samaritan and Arabic this strengthening has been retained throughout, and
the LXX write e.g. ????? for ??? ??.

§ 23. The Feebleness of the Gutturals a and h.

1. The ?, a light and scarcely audible guttural breathing, as a rule entirely loses its
slight consonantal power whenever it stands without a vowel at the end of a syllable.
It then remains (like the German h in roh, geh, nahte) merely as a sign of the
preceding long vowel, e.g. ?????, ?????, ?????? (but when a syllable is added with an
introductory vowel, according to b below, we have, e.g.  ?????????
then stands at the beginning of the syllable, not ????????, ?????????), ?????, ????? (cf.,
however, § 74 a),
&c. (§ 19 l), and even in
orthographic significance.

??????  (see above, § 22 e), the ? only retains an

 (for m??at?),

2. On the other hand, ? is in general retained as a strong consonant whenever it

begins a syllable, e.g. ????, ???????, or when it is protected by a ?a?eph after a short
syllable, e.g. ????????, and finally, when it stands in a closed syllable with quiescent
Šewâ after a preceding Seghôl or Patha?, e.g.
???
in such cases the consonantal power of ? may be entirely lost, viz.

, ??????? näd?r,

???

??????

??????

?

 yad??mû. Even

(a) when it would stand with a long vowel in the middle of a word after Šewâ mobile. The

?????

 two hundred (for me?tháyim), ?????? ?? Ez 25:6 for ?????? ??; ?????? Neh 6:8 for ???????; ???? Jb

long vowel is then occasionally thrown back into the place of the Šewâ, and the ? is only
retained orthographically, as an indication of the etymology, e.g. ?? ????? heads (for re?š??m),
????
31:7, Dn 1:4 for ?????; ?????? for ??????? Is 10:33; ??????? ?ô???m, 1 S 14:33 for ????????? (cf. § 74 h,
and § 75 oo); ??????????? Nu 34:14, from ???????; so always ?????? or ??????? 1 K 14:16, Mi 1:5,
&c., for ???????. Sometimes a still more violent suppression of the ? occurs at the beginning of
a syllable, which then causes a further change in the preceding syllable, e.g. ???????? work for
???????? (as in the Babylonian punctuation), ?????? ???? for ??????? ????; ???? ?? or ????? ?? the left hand,
ground form simâl.

(b) When it originally closed a syllable. In these cases ? is generally (by § 22 m)
pronounced with a ?a?eph, ?? or ??. The preceding short vowel is, however, sometimes
lengthened and retains the following ? only orthographically, e.g.
????  Nu 11:25 for
?????????? (cf. Ju 9:41), and ?????? Jo 2:6 for ????????; ?????? for ????????; ?????????? for ???????????;
but the contraction does not take place in
????
retained, although the consonantal power of ? is entirely lost, in ?????????, &c. (see § 102
m), ?????? Is 41:25, ?????????? Ez 28:16 for ????????????; cf. Dt 24:10, 1 K 11:39, Is 10:13.

 Is 10:11. The short vowel is

??????????

?????

Instead of this ? which has lost its consonantal value, one of the vowel letters ? and ? is
often written according to the nature of the sound, the former with ô and the latter with ô and
??, e.g. ???? buffalo for ?????. At the end of the word ? also is written for ?, ??????? he fills for ??????? Jb
8:21 (see below, l).

3. When ? is only preserved orthographically or as an indication of the etymology

 Jb 32:18 for ????????;

?????
???? ;
(quiescent), it is sometimes entirely dropped (cf. § 19 k), e.g.

Keth??bh for ??? ?????? (cf. Is 37:26); ????? Jb 29:6 for ??????.1 In
 1 K 5:25 (for ???????)
the strengthening of the following consonant by Dageš compensates for the loss of the
?; in
 Ez 20:37, if for ??????? (but read ?????, with Cornill), the preceding vowel is
lengthened; cf. above, c. On ????? for ??????, see § 68 g.

Rem. 1. In Aramaic the ? is much weaker and more liable to change than in Hebrew. In
literary Arabic, on the other hand, it is almost always a firm consonant. According to Arabic
orthography, ? serves also to indicatea long a, whereas in Hebrew it very rarely occurs as a
mere vowel letter after Qame?; as in ???? Ho 10:14 for ??? he rose up; ???? Pr 10:4, 13:23 for
??? poor; but in 2 S 11:1 the Keth??bh ??????????? the messengers, is the true reading; cf. § 7 b.

2. In some cases at the beginning of a word, the ?, instead of a compound Šeuâ, takes the
 girdle for ?????; cf. § 84 a, q, and the analogous cases in §

corresponding full vowel, e.g.  ?????
52 n, § 63 p, § 76 d, § 93 r (????????).

3. An ? is sometimes added at the end of the word to a final û, ??, or ô, e.g. ???????? for ???????

Jos 10:24 (before  !? ), ???? Is 28:12. These examples, however, are not so much instances of
‘Arabic orthography’, as early scribal errors, as in ??????? Je 10:5 for ?? ???????; and in ????? Ps
139:20 for ?? ?????. Cf. also ????? Ec 11:3 (§ 75 s); ?????? for ????? pure; ??? for ?? if; ????? for ???? then
(enclitic); ????? for ???? myriad, Neh 7:66, 71. On ??? and ???? see § 32 k.

4. The ? is stronger and firmer than the ?, and never loses its consonantal sound
(i.e. quiesces) in the middle of a word1 except in the cases noted below, in which it is
completely elided by syncope. On the other hand, at the end of a word it is always a
mere vowel letter, unless expressly marked by Mapp??q as a strong consonant (§ 14 a).
Yet at times the consonantal sound of ? at the end of a word is lost, and its place is
taken by a simple ? or more correctly ??, with R?phè as an indication of its non-
consonantal character, e.g. ???? to her for ???, Zc 5:11, &c. (cf. § 103 g, and §§ 58 g, 91
e); cf. also ??? for ??? (from ????) in proper names like
, &c.—Finally, in very many
cases a complete elision of the consonantal ? takes place by syncope: (a) when its
vowel is thrown back to the place of a preceding Šewâ mobile (see above, c, with ?),
e.g.
????
; ???????? for ??????????; perhaps also ????????
????
????? for ??????? [but see § 35 n],
for ?????????? Ez 27:32. (b) By contraction of the vowels preceding and following the ?,
e.g. ???? (also written ?????) from sûsahu (a+u=ô).—A violent suppression of ?
together with its vowel occurs in ??? (from ?????), &c.

Rem. In connexion with ? and ?, a ? which only marks the vowel ending is occasionally

changed into ? or ? (????= ?????
Aramaic orthography, but especially with ?, e.g. ??? ?? sleep, Ps 127:2 for ??? ??; ????? Jer 23:39
for ?????, &c. Thus it is evident that final ? as a vowel letter has only an orthographical
importance.

divided form ??????????? in the printed texts, Je 46:20.

Philippi, Die Aussprache der semit. Konsonanten ? und ? (mentioned above, § 5 b, note 1),
a thorough investigation of their phonetic value as consonantal, i.e. non-syllabic, vowel-
sounds, not palatal or labial fricatives; cf. also E. Sievers, Metrische Studien, i. 15.

? and ? are, as consonants, so weak, and approach so nearly to the corresponding
vowels u and i, that under certain conditions they very readily merge into them. This
fact is especially important in the formation of those weak stems, in which a ? or ?
occurs as one of the three radical consonants (§ 69 ff., § 85, § 93).

1. The cases in which ? and ? lose their consonantal power, i.e. merge into a vowel,

belong almost exclusively to the middle and end of words; at the beginning they
remain as consonants.1

The instances may be classified under two heads:

(a) When either ? or ? with quiescent Šewâ stands at the end of a syllable

immediately after a homogeneous vowel (u or i). It then merges in the homogeneous
vowel, or more accurately it assumes its vowel-character (? as u, ? as i), and is then
contracted with the preceding vowel into one vowel, necessarily long, but is mostly
retained orthographically as a (quiescent) vowel letter. Thus ? ???? for huwšab; ?????? for
yiyqa?; so also at the end of the word, e.g. ??????? a Hebrew, properly ibr??y, fem. ?????????,
pl. ?????????? (and ????????); ???? Jb 41:25 for ????? (cf. ?????? 1 S 25:18 Keth??bh). On the other
hand, if the preceding vowel he heterogeneous, ? and ? are retained as full consonants
(on the pronunciation see § 8 m), e.g. ??? ?? quiet, ??? the month of May, ??? nation, ?????
revealed. But with a preceding ? the ? and ? are mostly contracted into ô and ê (see
below, f), and at the end of a word they are sometimes rejected (see below, g).

Complete syncope of ? before ?? occurs in ??? island for ?????; ??? ruins for ?????; ???

watering Jb 37:11 for ?????; [?? burning Is 3:24 for ?????, cf. §§ 84a c, e, 93 y].

Thus an initial ?? after the prefixes ??, ??, ??  , ??, which would then be pronounced with ??
(see § 28 a), and also almost always after ?? (see § 102 b), coalesces with the ?? to ??, e.g.
????????? in Judah (for ?????), ????????? and Judah, ?????? as the Nile, ????????? for Judah, ??????
from the hands of.

(b) When ? and ? without a vowel would stand at the end of the word after

quiescent Šewâ, they are either wholly rejected and only orthographically replaced by
? (e.g.
??????  from bikhy, as well as the regularly formed ????? weeping; cf. § 93 x) or
become again vowel letters. In the latter case ? becomes a homogeneous ?ireq, and
also attracts to itself the tone, whilst the preceding vowel becomes Šewâ (e.g.  ??????
piry, properly pary); ? is changed sometimes into a toneless u (e.g.

 from tuhw).

 from

?????

1 1 Or as consonantal vowels (see above), and are then transcribed by P. Haupt,
Philippi, and others, as u(cid:31), i(cid:31), following the practice of Indogermanic philologists. ?
for ?? and, alone is a standing exception, see § 26. 1 and § 104 e. On ?=i at the
beginning of a word, cf. § 47 b, note. According to § 19 a, end, initial ? in Hebrew
almost always becomes ?; always in verbs originally ???, § 69 a. Apart from a few
proper names, initial ? occurs only in ??? hook, ????? child Gn 11:30, 2 S 6:23 Keth?(cid:31)bh
[elsewhere

], and the doubtful ????? Pr 21:8.

??(cid:31)???

Rem. In Syriac, where the weak letters more readily become vowel sounds, a simple i
may stand even at the beginning of words instead of ?? or ??. The LXX also, in accordance with
this, write ????? for ???????, ????? for ???????. Hence may be explained the Syriac usage in
Hebrew of drawing back the vowel i to the preceding consonant, which properly had a simple
vocal Šewâ, e.g. (according to the reading of Ben-Naphtali1) ????????? Jer 25:36 for
Baer), ????????? Ec 2:13 for ?????????, cf. also the examples in § 20 h, note 2; even
???
(in some editions) for
and therefore the 1st peps. was pointed ??????? to avoid confusion. In fact the Babylonian
punctuation always has ?? for ä in the 1st pers.

 Jb 29:21
???? . According to Qim?i (see § 47 b) ??????? was pronounced as iq??l,

????????  (so
??
?????

?????

2. With regard to the choice of the long vowel, in which ? and ? quiesce after such

vocalization and contraction, the following rules may be laid down:

(a) With a short homogeneous vowel ? and ? are contracted into the corresponding

long vowel (û or ??), see above, b.

(b) With short ? they form the diphthongs ô and ê according to § 7 a, e.g. ???????

from ????????; ?? ???? from ?? ??????, &c.2

Rem. The rejection of the half vowels ? and ? (see above, b) occurs especially at the end of

words after a heterogeneous vowel (?), if according to the nature of the form the contraction
appears impossible. So especially in verbs ???, e.g. originally ?????=
=?????, since ? after the
rejection of the ? stands in an open syllable, and consequently must be lengthened to ?. The ?
is simply an orthographic sign of the long vowel. So also ??? ?? for š?law.1 On the origin of
???????, see § 75 e; on ??? as perf. and part. of ???, see § 72 b and g; on ?????, &c., from ???, see § 69
b.—On the weakening of ? and ? to ?, see § 93 x.

§ 25. Unchangeable Vowels.

What vowels in Hebrew are unchangeable, i.e. are not liable to attenuation (to
Šewâ), modification, lengthening, or shortening, can be known with certainty only
from the nature of the grammatical forms, and in some cases by comparison with
Arabic (cf. § 1 m). This hems good especially of the essentially long vowels, i.e. those
long by nature or contraction, as distinguished from those which are only lengthened
rhythmically, i.e. on account of the special laws which in Hebrew regulate the tone
and the formation of syllables. The latter, when a change takes place in the position of
the tone or in the division of syllables, readily become short again, or are reduced to a
mere vocal Šewâ.

??(cid:31)?????

1 1 According to Abulwalid, Ben-Naphtali regarded the Yodh in all such cases as a
vowel letter.
2 2 Instances in which no contraction takes place after ? are, ??????????? 1 Ch 12:2; ?????????
Ho 7:12 (but cf. § 70 b); ? ?????? Ps 5:9 Qerê; the locatives
, &c.—On the
 see § 91 l.—Sometimes both forms are found, as ??????? and ?????;
suffix
??(cid:31)???
cf. ??? living, constr. state ???. Analogous is the contraction of
 (ground-form mawt)
death, constr. ???;
 (ground-form ayn [ain]) eye, constr. ????.
1 1 The Arabic, in such cases, often writes etymologically ?????, but pronounces gal?. So
the LXX ?????? ????, Vulg. Sina; cf. Nestle, ZAW. 1905, p. 362 f. But even in Arabic
??? is written for ??? ?? and pronounced sal?.

1. The essentially long and consequently, as a rule (but cf. § 26 p, § 27 n, o),
unchangeable vowels of the second and third class, ??, ê, û, ô, can often be recognized
by means of the vowel letters which accompany them (? ??, ? ??, ?, ?); e.g. ??????? he does
well, ?????? palace, ????? boundary, ??? voice. The defective writing (§ 8 i) is indeed
common enough, e.g. ?????? and ?????? for ???????; ????? for ?????; ??? for  ??? , but this is merely
an orthographic licence and has no influence on the quantity of the vowel; the û in ?????
is just as necessarily long, as in ?????.

As an exception, a merely tone-long vowel of both these classes is sometimes written

fully, e.g.

?????  for ???????.

??

2. The essentially or naturally long â (Qame? impure),2 unless it has become ô (cf.

§ 9 q), has as a rule in Hebrew no representative among the consonants, while in
Arabic it is regularly indicated by ?; on the few instances of this kind in Hebrew, cf. §
9 b, § 23 g. The naturally long â and the merely tone-long ? therefore can only be
distinguished by an accurate knowledge of the forms.

3. Short vowels in closed syllables (§ 26 b), which are not final, are as a rule
unchangeable, e.g. ??????? garment, ??????? wilderness, ????????? kingdom; similarly, short
vowels in sharpened syllables, i.e. before Dageš forte, e.g. ????? thief.

4. Finally, those long vowels are unchangeable which, owing to the omission of

the strengthening in a guttural or ?, have arisen by lengthening from the
corresponding short vowels, and now stand in an open syllable, e.g. ????? for m?”?n;
?????? for burrakh.

§ 26. Syllable-formation1 and its Influence on the Quantity of Vowels.

Apart from the unchangeable vowels (§ 25), the use of short or long vowels, i.e.

their lengthening, shortening, or change into vocal Šewâ, depends on the theory of
syllable-formation. The initial and final syllables especially require consideration.

1. The initial syllable. A syllable regularly begins with a consonant, or, in the case

of initial ? and ? (cf. note on § 5 b), a consonantal vowel.2 The copula is a standing
exception to this rule. According to the Tiberian pronunciation ?? and is resolved into
the corresponding vowel ? before Šewâ, and the labials, e.g. ??????,
punctuation in the latter cases writes ??, i.e. ?? before a full vowel.

; the Babylonian

????????

2. The final syllable. A syllable may end—

2 2 By vocales impurae the older grammarians meant vowels properly followed by a
vowel letter. Thus ????? kethâbh was regarded as merely by a licence for ??????, &c.
1 1 Cf. C. H. Toy, ‘The Syllable in Hebrew,’ Amer. Journal of Philol., 1884, p. 494
ff.; H. Strack, ‘The Syllables in the Hebrew Language,’ Hebraica, Oct. 1884, p. 73 ff.
2 2 We are not taking account here of the few eases in which initial Yodh is
represented as simple i, by being written ??? or ??, see § 24 e, and especially § 47 b,
note; nor of certain other eases in which ? with an initial vowel has only a graphic
purpose, though it is indispensable in an unpointed text.

(a) With a vowel, and is then called an open or simple syllable, e.g. in

?????????

the first and last are open. See below, e.

(b) With one consonant, and is then called a simple closed or compound syllable,

as the second in ?????, ?????. See below, o, p. Such are also the syllables ending in a
strengthened consonant, as the first in ????? qa?-??l. See below, q.

(c) With two consonants, a doubly closed syllable, as ?? ??? q?š?,

3 3 In opposition to this fundamental law in Hebrew (a long vowel in an open
syllable), the original short vowel is found always in Arabic, and sometimes in the
other Semitic languages, except of course in the case of naturally long vowels. The
above examples are pronounced in Arabia b?(cid:31)k?, q?t?l?, ?(cid:31)n?b. Although it is
certain therefore that in Hebrew also, at an earlier period, short vowels were
pronounced in open syllables, it may still be doubted whether the present
pronunciation is due merely to an artificial practice followed in the solemn recitation
of the O. T. text. On this hypothesis we should have still to explain, e.g. the
undoubtedly very old lengthening of ?(cid:31) and ? in an open syllable into ? and ?.
1 1 That these pretonic vowels are really long is shown by Brockelmann, ZA. xiv. 343
f., from the transcription of Hebrew proper names in the Nestorian (Syriac)
punctuation, and e.g. from the Arabic Ibrâhîm= ???????
the syllable before the tone as a means adopted by the Masoretes to preserve the
pronunciation of the traditional vowels. This explanation of the pretonic vowels as
due to a precaution against their disappearing, is certainly right; as to whether the
precaution can be ascribed to the Masoretes, see the previous note. For the pretonic
vowel the Arabic regularly has a short vowel (l?h?m, y?q?m, &c.), the Aramaic
simply a vocal Šewâ (?????, ?????, ?????, ?????); and even in Hebrew, when the tone is
thrown forward the pretonic vowel almost always becomes Šewâ, see § 27. It would,
however, be incorrect to assume from this that the pretonic vowel has taken the place
of Šewâ only on account of the following tone-syllable. It always arises from an
original short vowel, since such a vowel is mostly lengthened in an open syllable
before the tone, but when the tone is moved forward it becomes Šewâ.

. He regards their lengthening in

?

even when the Nun is not expressly written with Dageš. In cases like ????????? (§ 102 m) Patha?
is retained in the counter-tone after the ? has become quiescent.

(c) Sometimes before the toneless ? ?? local (§ 90 c), e.g.

??????????

 towards the wilderness;

only, however, in the constr, state (1 K 19:15), since the toneless suffix ? ?? does not affect the
character of the form (especially when rapidly pronunced in close connexion); otherwise it is
??????????

.

In all these cases the short vowel is also supported by the tone, either the principal tone of

the word, or (as in h) by the secondary tone in the constr. st., or by the counter-tone with
Metheg, as in ????????? above, g; cf. the effect of the arsis on the short vowel in classical prosody.

(d) In the combinations  ?? ???,  ?? ???,  ?? ???, e.g.

??

?????

 his boy, ???????? he will bind, ??????? his

deed. In all these cases the syllable was at first really closed, and it was only when the
guttural took a ?a?eph that it became in consequence open (but cf. e.g. ??????? and ????????). The
same vowel sequence arises wherever a preposition ??, ??  , ??, or ? copulative is prefixed to an
initial syllable which has a ?a?eph, since the former then takes the vowel contained in the
?a?eph (see § 102 d and § 104 d). To the same category belong also the cases where these
prepositions with ?ireq stand before a consonant with simple Šewâ mobile, e.g. ???????, ???????,
&c.

(e) In forms like ????????? yä?ä-ze-qû (they are strong), ????????? p?? lekh? (thy deed). These
again are cases of the subsequent opening of closed syllables (hence, e.g. ???????? also occurs);
????????? is properly p?lekh?; cf. generally § 22 m, end, and § 28 c.

Such eases as

????????

, ????? (§ 96),

???????

 (§ 67 w) do not come under this head, since

???

they all have ? in a virtually sharpened syllable; nor does the tone-bearing Seghôl in suffixes
(e.g.
???
§ 9 v.

), nor Seghôl for ? before a guttural with Qame? (§ 22 c). On ?? ????? ?? and ?? ???????, see

??????

4. The independent syllables with a firm vowel which have been described above,
are frequently preceded by a single consonant with vocal Šewâ, simple or compound.
Such a consonant with vocal Šewâ never has the value of an independent syllable, but
rather attaches itself so closely to the following syllable that it forms practically one
syllable with it, e.g. ????? (cheek) le???; ????? (sickness) ?ol??; ???????? yilìmedhû. This concerns
especially the prefixes ??, ??, ??  , ??. See § 102.

The Šewâ mobile is no doubt in all such eases weakened from an original full vowel (e.g.

???????? Arab. yaqt?lû, ???? Arab. b??k?, &c.); from this, however, it cannot be inferred that the
Masoretes regarded it as forming a kind of open syllable, for this would be even more directly
opposed to their fundamental law (viz. that a long vowel should stand in an open syllable),
than are the exceptions cited above, f–k. Even the use of Metheg with Šewâ in special cases
(see § 16 f) is no proof of such a view on the part of the Masoretes.

5. Closed syllables ending with one consonant, when without the tone, necessarily
have short vowels, whether at the beginning or at the end of words,1 e.g. ??????? queen,
????????  (wayy?q?m).
??? ???? understanding, ??????? wisdom,

????????  and he turned back,

???????? ,

1 1 In exceptions such as ?????? ?? Gn 4:25 (where š?t is required by the character of the
form, although the closed syllable has lost the tone owing to the following Maqqeph),

A tone-bearing closed syllable may have either a long or short vowel, but if the
latter, it must as a rule be either Patha? or Seghôl.2 The tone-bearing closed penultima
admits, of the long vowels, only the tone-long ?, ?, ?, not the longest ??, ê, ô, û; of the
short vowels, only ?, ?, not ??, ?, ? (but on ?? and ?, see § 29 g). Thus

6. A special kind of closed syllables are the sharpened, i.e. those which end in the

same (strengthened) consonant with which the following syllable begins, e.g.  ?????
m??, ???? k?l-lô. If without the tone, they have, like the rest, short vowels; but, if bearing
the tone, either short vowels as

, or long, as

 ??m-

?????? ,

?????? .

????? ,

???????

On the omission of the strengthening of a consonant at the end of a word, see § 20 l.

7. Syllables ending with two consonants occur only at the end of words, and have

most naturally short vowels, ????????, ?? ??????; but sometimes ?ere, as ??????, ????????, or ?olem,
?? ??? ??????. Cf., however, § 10 i. Usually the harshness of pronunciation is avoided by
the use of a helping vowel (§ 28 e).

§ 27. The Change of the Vowels, especially as regards Quantity.

The changes in sound through which the Hebrew language passed, before it
assumed the form in which we know it from the Masoretic text of the O. T. (see § 2
k), have especially affected its vowel system. A precise knowledge of these vowel
changes, which is indispensable for the understanding of most of the present forms of
the language, is derived partly from the phenomena which the language itself presents
in the laws of derivation and inflexion, partly from the comparison of the kindred
dialects, principally the Arabic. By these two methods, we arrive at the following
facts as regards Hebrew:

1. That in an open syllable the language has frequently retained only a half-vowel
(Šewâ mobile), where there originally stood a full short vowel, e.g. ??????? (ground-form
?g?l?t) a waggon, ??????? (groundform ??d?q?t) righteousness, ??????? (Arab. q?t?l?),
???????? (Arab. j?qatt?l?).

2. That vowels originally short have in the tone-syllable, as also in the open
syllable preceding it, been generally changed into the corresponding tone-long
vowels, ? into ?, ?? into ?, ? into ? (see 9, a–e, k, r). If, however, the tone be shifted or
weakened, these tone-long vowels mostly revert to their original shortness, or,
occasionally, are still further shortened, or reduced to mere Šewâ mobile, or, finally,
are entirely lost through a change in the division of syllables; e.g. ????? (Arab. m???r)
rain, when in close dependence on a following genitive in the construct state),

Metheg is used to guard against a wrong pronunciation; similarly ? is sometimes
retained before Maqqeph, e.g. ??? ?? Gn 2:13; ????? Gn 2:16.
2 2 See § 9 e, f. ?(cid:31) occurs thus only in the particles ???, ???, ???; but these usually (???
always) are rendered toneless by a following Maqqeph. Cf. also such forms as ?? ?????? §
26 r and § 75 q.

becomes ?????; ????? (Arab. ?q??b) heel, dual
????
the original ? of the first syllable to ??) ??????? [on the ?, see § 20 h]; ??????? (Arab. y?qt?l),
plur. ???????? (Arab. y?qt?lû). For instances of complete loss, as in ???????, cf. § 93 m.

, dual construct (with attenuation of

??????

According to § 26, the following details of vowel-change must be observed:

1. The original, or a kindred short vowel reappears—

(a) When a closed syllable loses the tone (§ 26 o). Thus, ??? hand, but ??????????? the
 the son of the king; ??? the whole, but ????????? the

hand of Yahwe; ??? son, but
whole of the people; so also when a tone-bearing closed syllable loses the tone on
taking a suffix, e.g. ????? enemy, but ????????? thy enemy; finally, when the tone recedes,
?????, but

????????  (wayy?q?m); ??????, but

????????? .

????????

?????

(b) To the same category belong cases like

??????  book, but ??????? my book;

??????

holiness, but ? ?????? my holiness. In spite of the helping vowel, ????? and ????? are really
closed syllables with a tone-long vowel; when the syllable loses the tone, the original
?? or ? (properly ?) reappears.

The same is true of syllables with a virtually sharpened final consonant: the
lengthening of original ?? to ? and ? to ? takes place only in a tone-bearing syllable; in
a toneless syllable the ?? or ? (or ?) remains, e.g. ??? mother, but ????? my mother; ???
law, plur. ??????; but ??? strength, ????? (and ?????) my strength.

2. The lengthening of the short vowel to the corresponding long, takes place—

(a) When a closed syllable becomes open by its final consonant being transferred

to a suffix beginning with a vowel, or in general to the following syllable, e.g. ?????,
????|??
before a suffix beginning with Šewâ mobile; e.g. ????????? from ?????, ????????? from ?????.

 primarily from ?????. Similarly ? mostly becomes ? even

 he has killed him;

????|???

(b) When a syllable has become open by complete loss of the strengthening of its

final consonant (a guttural or Rêš), e.g.

??|????  for birrakh, see § 22 c. Cf. also § 20 n.

(c) When a weak consonant (?, ?, ?) following the short vowel quiesces in this

vowel, according to § 23 a, c, d, § 24 f, e.g. ????? for ?????, where the ?, losing its
consonantal value, loses also the power of closing the syllable, and the open syllable
requires a long vowel.

(d) Very frequently through the influence of the pause, i.e. the principal tone in
the last word of a sentence or clause (§ 29 k). Sometimes also through the influence of
the article (§ 35 o).

3. When a word increases at the end and the tone is consequently moved forward,

or when, in the construct state (see § 89), or otherwise in close connexion with the
following word, its tone is weakened, in such cases a full vowel (short or tone-long)
may, by a change in the division of syllables, be weakened to Šewâ mobile, or even be
entirely lost, so that its place is taken by the mere syllable-divider (Šewâ quiescens).
Examples of the first case are, ? ?? name, pl. ??? ??, but ??? ?? my name, ????? ?? their

???????  righteousness, constr. st. ???????; an example of
names, ????? word, constr. st. ?????;
the second case is, ??????? blessing, constr. st. ???????. Whether the vowel is retained or
becomes Šewâ (???, ?????, but ? ??, ??? ??), and which of the two disappears in two
consecutive syllables, depends upon the character of the form in question. In general
the rule is that only those vowels which stand in an open syllable can become Šewâ.

Thus the change into Šewâ takes place in—

??????

???
??????
;
 she will return, plur.

??????
(a) The ? and ? of the first syllable, especially in the inflexion of nouns, e.g.
;
 my heart; but also in the
??????
, and so always, when the originally short

word, plur.
verb,  ??????
vowel of the prefixes of the Imperfect comes to stand in an open syllable which is not
pretonic. On the other hand, an ? lengthened from ? before the tone is retained in the
Perfect consecutive of Qal even in the secondary tone, e.g.  ???????????

, great, fem.
?????

??????
??
??????

 heart,  ??????

; cf. § 49 i.

??

?

(b) The short, or merely tone-long, vowels a, e, o of the ultima, especially in
verbal forms, e.g. ?????, fem. ???????? q??el?; ???????, ???????? yiq?elû; but note also ?????????,
??????????, &c., according to § 47 m and o. The helping vowels are either entirely omitted,
???????  king (ground-form malk), ??????? my king; or, under the influence of a guttural,
e.g.
are weakened to ?a?eph, e.g.
??????  boy, ?????? his boy. If the tone remains unmoved, the
vowel also is retained, notwithstanding the lengthening of the word, e.g.
pausal-form for ????????.

??????

???

Where the tone moves forward two places, the former of the two vowels of a
dissyllabic word may be shortened, and the second changed into Šewâ. Cf. ????? word;

2. In the place of a Patha? we not infrequently find (according to § 9 f) a Seghôl (?, è) as

a modification of ?:

(a) In a closed antepenultima, e.g. in the proper names ????????? and ?????????, where LXX ???-
= ?????, which is certainly the better reading, cf. Ulmer, Die semit. Eigennamen, 1901, p. 12: or

in a closed penultima, e.g. ???????, but also ??????? your hand, for yadekhèm. In all these cases the
character of the surrounding consonants (see § 6 q) has no doubt had an influence.

(b) Regularly before a guttural with Qame? or ?a?eph Qame?, where the
strengthening has been dropped, provided that a lengthening of the Patha? into
Qame? be not necessary, e.g. ?????? his brothers, for ’a??w; ????? false, for ka??š; ?????
governor, constr. st. ?????; ????? coal; ????? the living (with the article, ?? for ??); ????????? Nu
23:19, &c., and so always before ?? and ??, as ?? ????????? the months, see § 35 k. Before ??
and ?? Seghôl generally stands only in the second syllable before the tone, e.g. ?????????
the mountains; ??????? the guilt; immediately before the tone Patha? is lengthened into a
(pretonic) Qame?, e.g. ?????, ?????; but cf. also
consonants ? and ? (cf. § 22 c, q), the lengthening of the Patha? into Qame? almost
always takes place, e.g. ???? the father, pl. ???????; ?????? the head, pl. ?? ????????.

(c) As a modification of the orIginal Patha? in the first class of the segholate forms (§ 93

Arabic pronounced kelb),1 yar? (month), with a helping Patha?,
appears also in the formation of verbs, in cases like
helping Seeghôl, for yagl.

3. The attenuation of ? to ?? is very common in a toneless closed syllable.

(a) In a firmly closed syllable,

combined with singular suffixes, e.g. ??????? my rIghteousness, for ?adq??.

 with the suffix ??; cf. Lv 11:44, Ez 38:23, and § 44 d.

(b) In a loosely-closed syllable, i.e. one followed by an aspirated Begadkephath, as ???????
your blood, for ???????, and so commonly in the st. constr. plur. of segholates from the ground-
form qa?l, e.g. ??????? from ????? (ground-form bagd) a garment. In most cases of this kind the
attenuation is easily intelligible from the nature of the surrounding consonants. It is evident
from a comparison of the dialects, that the attenuation was consistently carried out in a very
large number of noun and verb-forms in Hebrew, as will be shown in the proper places.1

4. Seghôl arises, in addition to the cases mentioned in o and p, also from the weakening of
? of the final syllable in the isolated cases (? ?? for ? ??) in 1 S 28:15 (? see § 48 d), Ps 20:4 (?),
Is 59:5, Pr 24:14 (see § 48 l); for examples of Locative forms in ? ?? see § 90 i end.

6. To the chapter on vowel changes belongs lastly the dissimilation of vowels, i.e. the
change of one vowel into another entirely heterogeneous, in order to prevent two similar, or
closely related vowels, from following one another in the same word.2 Hence ????? for lû lô
(unless). Cf. also ?????? from ???; ?????? from ????; ?????? from ????; ?????? from
?????? ; ?????? from
stem ???; most probably also ????? offspring, ????? porcupine, for ????, ????, see § 68 c, note.—On
the proper names ????? and ??????, which were formerly explained in the same way, see now
Praätorius, ZDMG. 1905, p. 341 f.

§ 28. The Rise of New Vowels and Syllables.

1. According to § 26 m a half-syllable, i.e. a consonant with Šewâ mobile (always
weakened from a short vowel), can only occur in close dependence on a full syllable.
If another half-syllable with simple Šewâ follows, the first takes a full short vowel
again.3 This vowel is almost always ?ireq. In most cases it is probably an attenuation
of an original ?, and never a mere helping vowel. In some instances analogy may have
led to the choice of the ??. Thus, according to § 102 d, the prefixes ??, ??  , ?? before a
consonant with Šewâ mobile become ??, ??  , ??, e.g. ???????, ???????, ???????; before ?? they are
pointed as in ????????? (from bi-yehedû?, according to § 24 c); so too with W?w
copulative, e.g. ????????? for ????? attenuated from ????. The first half-syllable, after the
restoration of the short vowel, sometimes combines with the second to form a firmly
closed syllable, e.g. ??????? Nu 14:3 for l?neph?l, and so almost always in the infin.
constr. after ? (§ 45 g); in isolated cases also with ??  , as ??????? Jer 17:2.

???

2. If a guttural with ?a?eph follows, the original ? of the prefixes is retained
before ?a?eph Patha?, but before ?a?eph Seghol or ?a?eph Qame? it is modified to
the short vowel contained in the ?a?eph. Thus arise the vowel groups  ?? ???,  ?? ???,  ?? ???,
e.g.
?????  and I, ? ??????? as, ???????? to serve, ???????? to eat, ???????? in sickness. On the
Metheg with every such short vowel, see § 16 f, ?. Sometimes here also a fully closed
syllable is formed. In such a case, the prefix takes the short vowel, which would have
belonged to the suppressed ?a?eph, e.g. ??????? for ????????; ??????? Is 47:14 for ???????? (see
§ 67 cc); ??????? but also ????????; and even ??????? Jb 4:2, cf. Gn 32:16. So always in the
Infin. and Imperat. Qal of the verbs ????? to be and  ?????  to live, e.g. ???????? to be, ??????? and
be ye; even with ???, as ????????, on which cf. § 102 b; but ???????? and be, ????????? and live,
have ? instead of ?? under the prefix. For the Metheg, cf. § 16 f, ?.

3. When a ?a?eph in the middle of a word, owing to flexional changes, would

stand before a vocal Šewâ, it is changed into the short vowel, with which it is
compounded. This applies especially to cases in which the ?a?eph stands under a

2 2 Cf. Barth, Die Nominalbildung in den semit. Spr., p. xxix; A. Müller, Theol. Stud.

3 3 Except ?? and, which generally becomes ? before a simple Šewâ, cf. § 104 c.

guttural instead of quiescent Šewâ, as an echo of the preceding short vowel, e.g. ????????
he will stand (for ???????), but plur. ???????? for yaamedhû, and ?????????? for n?häphekhû (they
have turned themselves), ????????? thy work, cf. § 26 k. The syllables are to be divided
y??-medhû, and the second ? is to be regarded exactly as the helping Patha? in
?????? ,
&c.1

4. At the end of words, syllables occur which close with two consonants (§ 10 i, §

26 r), but only when the latter of the two is an emphatic consonant (?, ?) or a tenuis
(viz. ?, ?, ?, ?2), e.g. ?? ???? let him turn aside, ?? ?????? and he caused to drink,
 thou
(fem.) hast said, ???????? and he wept, ???????? and let him have dominion, ?? ?????? and he took
captive.

????????

This harsh ending is elsewhere avoided by the Masora,3 which inserts between the

two final consonants a helping vowel, usually Seghôl, but with medial or final
gutturals a Patha?,1 and after ? a ?ireq, e.g.
 and he revealed, for wayyigl;
it multiply, for yirb;
??????
?? ???????
are, however, to be regarded as exactly like furtive Patha? (§ 22 f, g); they do not
alter the monosyllabic character of the forms, and they disappear before formative
suffixes, e.g.  ??????

??????  let
??????  brook, ground-form na?l;

 house, ground-form bayt. These helping vowels

2 for ?????? ?? thou hast sent;

 holiness, ground-form qudš;

 my holiness,

 home-ward.

5. On the rise of a full vowel in place of a simple Šewâ, under the influence of the

pause, see § 29 m; on initial ?? for ??, see § 23 h.

§ 29. The Tone, its Changes and the Pause.

1. The principal tone rests, according to the Masoretic accentuation (cf. § 15 c), as

,  ???????? —in the
??
,  ?????
a rule on the final syllable, e.g.
last five examples on the formative additions to the stem. Less frequently it rests on
????? ; but a closed penultima can only have
the penultima, as in
), whilst a closed ultima can as a
the tone if the ultima is open (e.g.

1 1 In Ju 16:13 read ????????? not (with Opitius, Hahn and others) ?????.
2 2 With a final ??, the only example is ?????? Pr 30:6, where several MSS. and printed
editions incorrectly have ?? without Dageš. Instead of this masoretic caprice we should
.
no doubt read  (cid:31)?????
3 3 An analogy to this practice of the Masora is found among the modern Beduin, who
pronounce such a helping vowel before h, ?, ?, ?; cf. Spitta, Gramm. des arab.
Vulgärdialektes von Aegypten, Lpz. 1880, § 43 d.
1 1 On the apparent exceptions ? ????, &c., cf. § 22 e; other instances in which ? has
entirely lost its consonantal value, and is only retained orthographically, are ????? sin,
????? valley (also ???), ??? ?? vanity (Jb 15:31 Keth?(cid:31)bh ? ??).
2 2 In this form (§ 65 g) the Dageš lene remains in the final T?w, although a vowel
precedes, in order to point out that the helping Patha? is not to be regarded as a really
full vowel, but merely as an orthographic indication of a very slight sound, to ensure
the correct pronunciation. An analogous case is ?????? yi??d from ????? (§ 75 r).

rule only be without the tone if the penultima is open, e.g.
e.

???????? ,

???????? ; see also below,

A kind of counter-tone or secondary stress, as opposed to the principal tone, is
marked by Metheg (§ 16 c). Words which are closely united by Maqqeph with the
following word (§ 16 a) can at the most have only a secondary tone.

2. The original tone of a word, however, frequently shifts its place in consequence

either of changes in the word itself, or of its close connexion with other words. If the
word is increased at the end, the tone is moved forward (descendit) one or two places
 your words;
according to the length of the addition, e.g.
??????
???????????

?????????

3. On the other hand, the original tone is shifted from the ultima to the penultima

(ascendit):

(a) In many forms of the Imperfect, under the influence of a prefixed W?w

consecutive ( ??·  see § 49 c–e), e.g.
?????????  and he went. Cf. also § 51 n on the impf. Niphal, and § 65 g, end, on the impf.
Piel; on these forms in Pause, when the ? consec. does not take effect, see below, p.

 and he said;

 he will say,

???????  he will go,

????
?

?????

????

??

(b) For rhythmical reasons (as often in other languages), when a monosyllable, or
a word with the tone on the first syllable, follows a word with the tone on the ultima,
in order to avoid the concurrence of two tone-syllables1. This rhythmical retraction of
the tone, however (???? ????? receding, as it is called by the Jewish grammarians), is
only admissible according to a, above, provided that the penultima, which now
receives the tone, is an open syllable (with a long vowel; but see g), whilst the ultima,
which loses the tone, must be either an open syllable with a long vowel, e.g.
?? ???
???
Gn 1:5, 4:17, 27:25, Ex 16:29, Ps 5:11, 104:14, Dn 11:13, or a closed syllable with a
 Gn 3:19, Jb 3:3, 22:28.2 The grave suffixes ????, ???, ????,
short vowel, e.g.
???? are exceptions, as they never lose the tone. Moreover a fair number of instances
occur in which the above conditions are fulfilled, but the tone is not retracted, e.g. esp.
with ?????, and before ?; cf. Qim?i, Mikhlol, ed. Rittenberg (Lyck, 1862), p. 4b, line 13
ff.

1 1 Even Hebrew prose proceeds, according to the accentuation, in a kind of iambic
rhythm. That this was intended by the marking of the tone, can be seen from the use
of Metheg.—Jos. Wijnkoop in Darche hannesigah sive leges de accentus Hebraicae
linguae ascensione, Ludg. Bat. 1881, endeavours to explain, on euphonic and
syntactical grounds, the numerous cases in which the usual retraction of the tone does

described by Baer as ‘error turpie’.—That an unchangeable vowel in a closed final
syllable cannot lose the tone is shown by Prätorius from the duplication of the accent

Although ?ere can remain in a closed ultima which has lost the tone, it is perhaps
not to be regarded in this case (see § 8 b) as a long vowel. At any rate it then always
has, in correct editions, a retarding Methog, no doubt in order to prevent its being
pronounced as Seghôl, e.g.
 Nu 24:22; cf. Nu 17:23, Ju 20:2, Is 66:3, Jer
23:29, Ez 22:25, Ps 37:7, and even with a following furtive Patha? Pr 1:19, 11:26,
&c., although there is no question here of two successive tone-syllables. In other cases
the shortening into Seghôl does take place, e.g.
 who smiteth the anvil, Is
??
41:7, for
 1 K 16:24.—The retraction of the tone even occurs
when a half-syllable with a Šewâ mobile precedes the original tone-syllable, e.g.
?? ??????  Gn 19:5, and frequently;
?????
14:19; as also when the tone-syllable of the second word is preceded by a half-
syllable, e.g.

????? ?? ??  Gn 1:11 (on the Dag. f., cf. § 20 f);

???? ???  Gn 15:7 (cf. § 20 c).

4. Very important changes of the tone and of the vowels are effected by the pause.

By this term is meant the strong stress laid on the tone-syllable in the last word of a
sentence (verse) or clause. It is marked by a great distinctive accent, Sillûq, Athnâ?,
and in the accentuation of the books ????, Ôlè weyôr?d (§ 15 h). Apart from these
principal pauses (the great pause), there are often pausal changes (the lesser pause)
with the lesser distinctives, especially Segolta, Zaqeph qa?on, Rebh??a, and even with
Paš?a, Tiph?a, Gereš, and (Pr 30:4) Pazer.1 The changes are as follows:

1 1 In most cases, probably on account of a following guttural or (at the end of a
sentence) ? (cf. e.g. Ex 21:31, Jer 3:9 [but Ginsb. ??????], Ru 4:4, Ec 11:6 [but Ginsb.
? ????]; before ?? Jer 17:11) [see also § 29 w].
where ? has muna?, are very irregular, but the lengthening here is probably only to
avoid the cacophony šphá(cid:31)? ?t. In the same way ????????? Ez 17:15 (with Mahpakh
before ??) and ????????? Ez 37:8 (with Darga before ??) are to be explained. The four
instances of ???? for ????? apparently require a different explanation; see § 32 c.—The
theory of Olshausen and others that the phenomena of the pause are due entirely to
liturgical considerations, i.e. that it is ‘a convenient way of developing the musical
value of the final accents by means of fuller forms’ in liturgical reading (Sievers,

of Athna?, especially after Ôlè weyored (§ 15 o); cf. Ps 100:8, Pr 30:9, and Qim?i, Mikhlol,

SECOND PART

ETYMOLOGY, OR THE PARTS OF SPEECH

§ 30. Stems and Roots1: Biliteral, Triliteral, and Quadriliteral.

1. Stems in Hebrew, as in the other Semitic languages, have this peculiarity, that

??????

??????

 deep,

by far the majority of them consist of three consonants. On these the meaning
essentially depends, while the various modifications of the idea are expressed rather
by changes in the vowels, e.g. ??? (????? or ?????; the 3rd pers. sing. perf. does not
occur) it was deep,
 depth,
either a verb or a noun, and the language commonly exhihits both together, e.g. ????? he
??????  seed; ????? he was wise, ????? a wise man. For practical purposes,
has sown,
however, it has long been the custom to regard as the stein the 3rd pers. sing. Perf.
Qal (see § 43), since it is one of the simplest forms of the verb, without any formative
additions. Not only are the other forms of the verb referred to this stem, but also the
noun-forms, and the large number of particles derived from nouns; e.g. ????? he was
holy,

?????? , a valley, plain. Such a stem may be

 holiness, ????? holy.

??????

Sometimes the language, as we have it, exhibits only the verbal stem without any

corresponding noun-form, e.g. ????? to stone, ????? to bray; and on the other hand, the
noun sometimes exists without the corresponding verb, e.g.
Since, however, the nominal or verbal stems, which are not now found in Hebrew,
generally occur in one or more of the other Semitic dialects, it may be assumed, as a
rule, that Hebrew, when a living language, also possessed them. Thus, in Arabic, the
verbal stem ?b?n? (to become compact, hard) corresponds to
verb negab (to be dry) to

?????? , and the Aramaic

??????  stone,

??????  south.

?????? .

Rem. 1. The Jewish grammarians call the stem (i.e. the 3rd pers. sing. Perf. Qal)

??????

root. Hence it became customary among Christian grammarians to call the stem radix, and its
three consonants litterae radicales, in contradistinction to the litterae serviles or formative
letters. On the correct use of the term root, see g.

2. Others regard the three stem-consonants as a root, in the sense that, considered as
vowelless and unpronounceable, it represents the common foundation of the verbal and
nominal stems developed from it, just as in the vegetable world, from which the figure is
borrowed, stems grow from the hidden root, e.g.

Verb-stem, ?????? he has reigned.

Noun-stem,

???????  king.

Root: ???, the indeterminate idea of ruling.

For the historical investigation of the language, however, this hypothesis of

unpronounceable roots, with indeterminate meaning, is fruitless. Moreover, the term root, as

1 1 On the questions discussed here compare the bibliography at the head of § 79.

it is generally understood by philologists, cannot be applied to the Semitic triliteral stem (see
f).1

3. The 3rd sing. Perf. Qal, which, according to the above, is usually regarded, both

lexicographically and grammatically, as the ground-form, is generally in Hebrew a
dissyllable, e.g. ?????. The monosyllabic forms have only arisen by contraction (according to
the traditional explanation) from stems which had a weak letter (? or ?) for their middle
consonant, e.g. ??? from q?w?m ; or from stems whose second and third consonants are
identical, e.g. ??? and ????? (but see below, §§ 67, 72). The dissyllabic forms have themselves
no doubt arisen, through a loss of the final vowel, from trisyllables, e.g. ????? from q?t?l?, as it
is in literary Arabic.

2. The law of the triliteral stem is so strictly observed in the formation of verbs
and nouns in Hebrew (and in the Semitic languages generally), that the language has
sometimes adopted artificial methods to preserve at least an appearance of
??????  for the inf. constr. of verbs ???; cf. § 69
triliteralism in monosyllabic stems, e.g.
b. Conversely such nouns, as ?? father, ??? mother, ?? brother, which were formerly
all regarded as original monosyllabic forms (nomina primitiva), may, in some cases at
least, have arisen from mutilation of a triliteral stem.

On the other hand, a large number of triliteral stems really point to a biliteral base,

which may be properly called a root (radix primaria, bilitteralis), since it forms the
starting-point for several triliteral modifications of the same fundamental idea.
Though in themselves unpronounceable, these roots are usually pronounced with ?
between the two consonants, and are represented in writing by the sign (cid:31), e.g. (cid:31) ?? as
the root of ?????, ?????, ???, ????. The reduction of a stem to the underlying root may
generally be accomplished with certainty when the stem exhibits one weak consonant
with two strong ones, or when the second and third consonants are identical. Thus e.g.
the stems ??????, ????, ?????, ????? may all be traced to the idea of striking, breaking, and the
root common to them all is evidently the two strong consonants ?? (dakh). Very
frequently, however, the development of the root into a stem is effected by the
addition of a strong consonant, especially, it seems, a sibilant, liquid or guttural.1
Finally, further modifications of the same root are produced when either a consonant
of the root, or the letter which has been added, changes by phonetic laws into a
kindred letter (see the examples below). Usually such a change of sound is
accompanied by a modification of meaning.

Examples: from the root ?? (no doubt onomatopoetic, i.e. imitating the sound), which
represents the fundamental idea of carving off, cutting in pieces, are derived directly: ??? and
??? to cut, to cut off; the latter also metaph. to decide, to judge (whence ??????, Arab. qâ?i, a
judge); also
?????  to cut off, to shear, ????? to tear, to break, ????? to cut into, ????? to cut off, to
reap. With a dental instead of the sibilant, ??, ??, whence ????? to cut in pieces, to destroy, ?????
to cut down, to kill, ????? to tear off, to pluck off. With the initial letter softened, the root
becomes ??, whence ????? to cut off, and ????? to shave; cf. also ??? Syr. to slay (sacrifice), to
kill. With the greatest softening to ?? and ??; ????? to cut off, to shear; ????? to hew stone; ???, ?????,

1 1 Cf. Philippi, ‘Der Grundstamm des starken Verbums, ’ in Morgenländische
Forschungen, Leipz. 1875, pp. 69–106.
1 1 That all triliteral stems are derived from biliterals (as König, Lehrg. ii. 1, 370; M.
Lambert in Studies in honour of A. Kohut, Berl. 1897, p. 354 ff.) cannot be definitely
proved.

?????, ?????, ????? to cut off, to tear off, eat up; similarly ????? to cut into, ????? to cut off; cf. also ?????, ?????,
?????. Allied to this root also is the series of stems which instead of a palatal begin with a
guttural (?), e.g. ????? to split, cut; cf. also ???, ???, ???, ???, and further ???, ???, ???, ???, ???,
???, ???, ???, ???, ???, ???, ???, ???, ??? in the Lexicon..

The root ?? expresses the sound of humming, which is made with the mouth closed

(µ??); hence ?????, ???, ?????,

 (?????

)????

 Arab. hámhama, to buzz, to hum, to snarl, &c.

As developments from the root ?? cf. the stems ?????, ?????, ?????, ?????, ?????, ?????. Not loss

numerous are the developments of the root ?? (??, ??) and many others.2

Closer investigation of the subject suggests the following observations:

(a) These roots are mere abstractions from stems in actual use, and are themselves

not used. They represent rather the hidden germs (semina) of the stems which appear
in the language. Yet these stems are sometimes so short as to consist simply of the
elements of the root itself, e.g. ??? to be finished, ??? light. The ascertaining of the root
and its meaning, although in many ways very difficult and hazardous, is of great
lexicographical importance. It is a wholly different and much contested question
whether there ever was a period in the development of the Semitic languages when
purely biliteral roots, either isolated and invariable or combined with inflexions,
served for the communication of thought. In such a case it would have to be admitted,
that the language at first expressed extremely few elementary ideas, which were only
gradually extended by additions to denote more delicate shades of meaning. At all
events this process of transformation would belong to a period of the language which
is entirely outside our range. At the most only the gradual multiplication of stems by
means of phonetic change (see below) can be historically proved.

(b) Many of these monosyllabic words are clearly imitations of sounds, and sometimes
coincide with roots of a similar meaning in the Indo-Germanic family of languages (§ 1 h). Of
other roots there is definite evidence that Semitic linguistic consciousness regarded them as
onomatopoetic, whilst the Indo-Germanie instinct fails to recognize in them any imitation of
sound.

(c) Stems with the harder, stronger consonants are in general (§ 6 r) to be regarded as the

older, from which a number of later stems probably arose through softening of the
consonants; cf. ??? and ???, ??? and ???, ??? and ???, ??? and ???, ???; ??? and ????, and the
almost consistent change of initial ? to ?. In other instances, however, the harder stems have
only been adopted at a later period from Aramaic, e.g. ???, Hebr. ???. Finally in many cases
the harder and softer stems may have been in use together from the first, thus often
distinguishing, by a kind of sound-painting, the intensive action from the less intensive; see
above ??? to cut, ??? to shear, &c.

(d) When two consonants are united to form a root they are usually either both emphatic

or both middle-hard or both soft, e.g. ??, ??, ??, ??, ?? never ??, ??, ??, ??, ??. Within (triliteral)
stems the first and second consonants are never identical. The apparent exceptions are either

the Thesaurus and Lexicon of Gesenius, by F. Brown, S. R. Driver, and C. A. Britts,
Oxford, 1906.
2 2 Cf. the interesting examination of the Semitic roots QR, KR, XR, by P. Haupt in
the Amer. Journ. of Sem. Lang., xxiii (1907), p. 241 ff.

due to reduplication of the root, e.g. ??? (Ps 42:5, Is 38:15), Arabic ????, or result from other
causes, cf. e.g. ??? in the Lexicon.. The first and third consonants are very seldom identical
except in what are called concave stems (with middle ? or ?), e.g. ???, ???; note, however, ???,
???, ???, ???, and on ??? Jb 39:30 see § 55 f. The second and third consonants on the other
hand are very frequently identical, see § 67.1

(e) The softening mentioned under l is sometimes so great that strong consonants,

especially in the middle of the stem, actually pass into vowels: cf. § 19 o, and  ???????
if is for ?????????.

?

 Lv 16:8 ff.

(f) Some of the cases in which triliteral stems cannot with certainty be traced back to a

biliteral root, may be due to a combination of two roots—a simple method of forming
expressions to correspond to more complex ideas.

3. Stems of four, or even (in the case of nouns) of five consonants2 are secondary

formations. They arise from an extension of the triliteral stem: (a) by addition of a
fourth stem-consonant; (b) in some eases perhaps by composition and contraction of
two triliteral stems, by which means even quinquiliterals are produced. Stems which
have arisen from reduplication of the biliteral root, or from the mere repetition of one
or two of the three original stem-consonants, e.g. ??????? from ??? or ???,
???, are usually not regarded as quadriliterals or quinqueliterals, but as conjugational
forms (§ 55); so also the few words which are formed with the prefix ?, as
flame from ?????, correspond to the Aramaic conjugation Šaph?l,

.

Rem. on (a). The letters r and l, especially, are inserted between the first and second
radicals, e.g. ?????, ??????? to eat up; ?????? ?? =
??????  sceptre (this insertion of an r is especially
frequent in Aramaic); ????????? hot wind from ????? to be hot. Cf. Aram. ??????? to roll, expanded
from ????? (conjugation Pa?l, corresponding to the Hebrew Pi?l). In Latin there is a similar
expansion of fid, scid, tud, jug into findo, scindo, tundo, jungo. At the end of words the
commonest expansion is by means of ? and ?, e.g. ??????? axe, ??????? garden-land (from
??????? corolla (??????? cup); cf. § 85, xi.

?????? ),

Rem. on (b). Forms such as ?????????? frog,

 meadow-saffron, ????????? shadow of death,1
??????????
were long regarded as compounds, though the explanation of them all was uncertain. Many
words of this class, which earlier scholars attempted to explain from Hebrew sources, have
since proved to be loan-words (§ 1 i), and consequently need no longer be taken into account.

4. A special class of formations, distinct from the fully developed stems of three
or four consonants, are (a) the Interjections (§ 105), which, as being direct imitations
of natural sounds, are independent of the ordinary formative laws; (b) the Pronouns.
Whether these are to be regarded as the mutilated remains of early developed stems,
or as relics of a period of language when the formation of stems followed different

the Thesaurus and Lexicon of Gesenius, by F. Brown, S. R. Driver, and C. A. Britts,

1 1 Consonants which are not found together in roots and stems are called
incompatible. They are chiefly consonants belonging to the same class, e.g. ??
??, ??, ??, ??, ??, ??, ??, ??, ??, ??, &c., or in the reverse order.

, ??, ??,

laws, must remain undecided. At all events, the many peculiarities of their formation2
require special treatment (§ 32 ff.). On the other hand, most of the particles (adverbs,
prepositions, conjunctions) seem to have arisen in Hebrew from fully developed
stems, although in many instances, in consequence of extreme shortening, the
underlying stem is no longer recognizable (see § 99 ff.).

§ 31. Grammatical Structure.

P. Dörwald, ‘Die Formenbildungsgesetze des Hebr.’ (Hilfsbuch für Lehrer des Hebr.),
Berlin, 1897, is recommended for occasional reference.

1. The formation of the parts of speech from the stems (derivation), and their

inflexion, are effected in two ways: (a) internally by changes in the stem itself,
particularly in its vowels: (b) externally by the addition of formative syllables before
or after it. The expression of grammatical relations (e.g. the comparative degree and
some case-relations in Hebrew) periphrastically by means of separate words belongs,
not to etymology, but to syntax.

The external method (b) of formation, by affixing formative syllables, which occurs e.g.
in Egyptian, appears on the whole to be the more ancient. Yet other families of language, and
particularly the Semitic, at a very early period had recourse also to the internal method, and
during their youthful vigour widely developed their power of forming derivatives. But the
continuous decay of this power in the later periods of language made syntactical
circumlocution more and more necessary. The same process may be seen also e.g. in Greek
(including modern Greek), and in Latin with its Romance offshoots.

?

2. Both methods of formation exist together in Hebrew. The internal mode of
formation by means of vowel changes is tolerably extensive (?????, ?????, ?????; ?????, ?????,
&c.). This is accompanied in numerous cases by external formation also (?????????,
????????,  ??????
, &c.), and even these formative additions again are subject to internal
change, e.g. ?????????, ???????. The addition of formative syllables occurs, as in almost all
languages, chiefly in the formation of the persons of the verb, where the meaning of
the affixed syllables is for the most part still perfectly clear (see §§ 44, 47). It is also
employed to distinguish gender and number in the verb and noun. Of case-endings, on
the contrary, only scanty traces remain in Hebrew (see § 90).

and simplest elements of the language (§ 30 s). It must be discussed before the verb,
since it plays an important part in verbal inflexion (§§ 44, 47).

The forms enclosed in parentheses are the less common. A table of these pronouns with

their shortened forms (pronominal suffixes) is given in Paradigm A at the end of this
Grammar.

REMARKS.

First Person.

1. The form ??????? is less frequent than ?????1 The former occurs in Phoenician, Moabite, and

Assyrian, but in no other of the kindred dialects;1 from the latter the suffixes are derived (§
33). The ô most probably results from an obscuring of an original â (cf. Aram. ?????, Arab.
 occurs not only with small disjunctive accents, but even with
’ána). The pausal form  ?????
????
conjunctives; so always in  ? ???

 as I live! also Is 49:18 with Muna?, Ps 119:125 with Merkha

1 1 On the prevalence of ?????? in the earlier Books compare the statistics collected by
Giesebrecht in ZAW. 1881, p. 251 ff., partly contested by Driver in the Journal of
Philology, 1882, vol. xi. p. 222 ff. (but cf. his Introduction, ed. 6, p. 135, line 1 f.), but
thoroughly established by König in Theol. Stud. u. Krit., 1893, pp. 464 ff. and 478,
and in his Einleitung in das A. T., p. 168, &c. In some of the latest books ???? is not
found at all, and hardly at all in the Talmud. [For details see the Lexicon., s. v. ????? and
????? .]
?
1 1 In Phoenician and Moabite (inscription of Mêša, line 1) it is written ???, without
the final ? ??. In Punic it was pronounced anec (Plaut. Poen. 5, 1, 8) or anech (5, 2, 35).
Cf. Schröder, Phöniz. Sprache, p. 143. In Assyrian the corresponding form is anaku,
in old Egyptian anek, Coptic anok, nok.

(which, however, has been altered from De???), and twice in Mal 1:6. In all these cases there is
manifestly a disagreement between the vocalization already established and the special laws
regulating the system of accentuation.

2. The formation of the plural, in this and the other persons, exhibits a certain analogy

with that of the noun, while at the same time (like the pronouns of other languages) it is
characterized by many differences and peculiarities. The short form
suffix is derived occurs only in Jer 42:6 Keth??bh. The form
Nu 32:32, La 3:42;
???

 from which the
)
????  (cf. § 19 h) only in Ex 16:7, 8,
 in pause, Gn 42:11; in Arabic n??nu is the regular form. In the Mišna

 has altogether supplanted the longer forms.

???????

3. The pronoun of the 1st person only is, as a rule in languages, of the common gender,
because the person who is present and speaking needs no further indication of gender, as does
the 2nd person, who is addressed (in Greek, Latin, English, &c., this distinction is also
lacking), and still more the 3rd person who is absent.

Second Person.

4. The forms of the 2nd person ????, ???, ????,

, &c., are contracted from ’ant?, &c.

???????

The kindred languages have retained the n before the ?, e.g. Arab. ’án?, fem. ’ánti, thou; pl.
’ántum, fem. ’antúnna, ye. In Syriac ???, fem. ???? are written, but both are pronounced ’at. In
Western Aramaic ????? is usual for both genders.

??? (without ?) occurs five times, e.g. Ps 6:4, always as Keth??bh, with ???? as Qerê. In three

places ??? appears as a masculine, Nu 11:15, Dt 5:24, Ez 28:14.

The feminine form was originally ???? as in Syriac, Arabic, and Ethiopic. This form is
found seven times as Keth??bh (Ju 17:2, 1 K 14:2, 2 K 4:16, 23, 8:1, Jer 4:30, Ez 36:13) and
appears also in the corresponding personal ending of verbs (see § 44 f), especially, and
necessarily, before suffixes, as
of the imperative and imperfect. The final ?? was, however, gradually dropped in
pronunciation, just as in Syriac (see above, f) it was eventually only written, not pronounced.
The ? therefore finally disappeared (cf. § 10 k), and hence the Masoretes, even in these seven
passages, have pointed the word in the text as ???? to indicate the Qerê ??? (see § 17). The same
final ? ?? appears in the rare (Aramaic) forms of the suffix

, § 59 a [c]; cf. also ?? as the ending of the 2nd fem. sing.

 (§§ 58, 91).

5. The plurals ???? (with the second vowel assimilated to the fem. form) and

????

 (

????

,
)

with the tone on the ultima, only partially correspond to the assumed ground-forms antum?,
fem. antinn?, Arab. á?nt?m (Aram. ????, ??????) and ?ntú?nna (Aram. ?????, ???????). The form ???? is
found only in Ez 34:31 (so Qim?i expressly, others ????);
???????
used as feminine.

 (for which some MSS. have
) only four times, viz. Gn 31:6, Ez 13:11, 20, 34:17; in 13:20 ???? (before a ?  ) is even

???????

Third Person.

6. (a) In ??? and ???? (hû and h??) the ? (corresponding to the Elif of prolongation in Arabic,
cf. § 23 i) might be regarded only as an orthographic addition closing the final long vowel, as

in ???, ??????, &c. The ? is, however, always written in the case of the separate pronouns,1 and
only as a toneless suffix (§ 33 a) does ??? appear as ??, while ???? becomes ??. In Arabic (as in
Syriac) they are written ?? and ?? but pronounced húw? and h??y?, and in Vulgar Arabic even
húwwa and h??yya. This Arabic pronunciation alone would not indeed be decisive, since the
vowel complement might have arisen from the more consonantal pronunciation of the ? and ?;
but the Ethiopic weetû (=hua-tû) for ???, yeet?? (=hia-t??) for ???? (cf. also the Assyrian ya-u-a
for ?????) show that the ? was original and indicated an original vocalic termination of the two
words. According to Philippi (ZDMG. xxviii. 175 and xxix. 371 ff.) ??? arose from a primitive
Semitic ha-va, ???? from ha-ya.

(b) The form ??? also stands in the consonantal text (Keth??bh) of the Pentateuch2 (with the
exception of eleven places) for the fem. ????. In all such cases the Masora, by the punctuation
????  (Qerê perpetuum, see § 17). The old explanation regarded this
????, has indicated the Qerê
phenomenon as an archaism which was incorrectly removed by the Masoretes. This
assumption is, however, clearly untenable, if we consider (1) that no other Semitic language is
without the quite indispensable distinction of gender in the separate pronoun of the 3rd pers.;
(2) that this distinction does occur eleven times in the Pentateuch, and that in Gn 20:5, 38:25,
Nu 5:13, 14 ???? and ???? are found close to one another; (3) that outside the Pentateuch the
distinction is found in the oldest documents, so that the ???? cannot be regarded as having been
subsequently adopted from the Aramaic; (4) that those parts of the book of Joshua which
certainly formed a constituent part of the original sources of the Pentateuch, know nothing of
this epicene use of ???. Consequently there only remains the hypothesis, that the writing of
??? for ??? rests on an orthographical peculiarity which in some recension of the Pentateuch-
text was almost consistently followed, but was afterwards very properly rejected by the
Masoretes. The orthography was, however, peculiar to the Pentateuch-text alone, since it is
unnecessary to follow the Masora in writing ???? for ??? in 1 K 17:15, Is 30:33, Jb 31:11, or
??? for
correct form in the Keth??bh throughout. Levy’s explanation of this strange practice of the
Masoretes is evidently right, viz. that originally ?? was written for both forms (see k, note),
and was almost everywhere, irrespective of gender, expanded into ???. On the whole question
see Driver, Leviticus (in Haupt’s Bible), p. 25 f. In the text Driver always reads ??.

????  in Ps 73:16, Ec 5:8, 1 Ch 29:16. The Samaritan recension of the Pentateuch has the

7. The plural forms

 and
????? have probably been assimilated to
Aram. ?????, ???? (?????, ?????), Syr. henûn (enûn), Arab. húmû (archaic form of hum), and Ethiop.
hômû, an ô or ô is appended, which in Hebrew seems to reappear in the poetical suffixes ???,
??

 (after prefixes ???, ???) are of doubtful origin, but ???,
 which goes back to a form h??nn?. In Western

In some passages

??????  stands for the feminine (Zc 5:10, Ct 6:8, Ru 1:22; cf. the use of the
suffix of the 3rd masc. for the 3rd fem., § 135 o and § 145 t). For the quite anomalous ??????? 2
K 9:18 read ????????? (Jb 32:12).

8. The pronouns of the 3rd person may refer to things as well as persons. On their

meaning as demonstratives see § 136.

1 1 In the inscription of King Mêša (see § 2 d), lines 6 and 27, we find ?? for ???, and
in the inscription of Ešmunazar, line 22, for ????, but in the Zenjirli inscriptions (see §
1 m) both ?? and  ??  occur (Hadad i, l. 29).

§ 33. Pronominal Suffixes.

Brockelmann, Semit. Sprachwiss., p. 100 f.; Grundriss, i. 306 ff. J. Barth, ‘Beiträge zur
Suffixlehre des Nerdsemit., ’ in the Amer. Journ. of Sem. Lang., 1901, p. 193 ff.

1. The independent principal forms of the personal pronoun (the separate
pronoun), given in the preceding section, express only the nominative.1 The
accusative and genitive are expressed by forms, usually shorter, joined to the end of
verbs, nouns, and particles (pronominal suffixes or simply suffixes); e.g. ?? (toneless)
and ? (from ?hû) eum and eius,
?hû contracted into ô)  ???????

???
) lux eius.

 I have killed him (also

 thou hast killed him;  ?????

???????? ),

???????

????????

????????

???

??

??

?

 or (with

The same method is employed in all the other Semitic languages, as well as in the
Egyptian, Persian, Finnish, Tartar, and others; in Greek, Latin, and German we find only
slight traces of the kind, e.g. German, er gab’s for er gab es; Greek, ????? µ?? for ?????
?µ??; Latin, eccum, eccos, &c., in Plautus and Terence for ecce eum, ecce eos.

2. The case which these suffixes represent is—

(a) When joined to verbs, the accusative (cf., however, § 117 x), e.g.

???

????????

 I

?

have killed him.

(b) When affixed to substantives, the genitive (like ????? µ??, pater eius). They

then serve as possessive pronouns, e.g. ???? (?bh-??) my father, ???? his horse, which
may be either equus eius or equus suus.

(c) When joined to particles, either the genitive or accusative, according as the

particles originally expressed the idea of a noun or a verb, e.g. ??????, literally
interstitium mei, between me (cf. mea causa); but ??????? behold me, ecce me.

(d) Where, according to the Indo-Germanic case-system, the dative or ablative of
the pronoun is required, the suffixes in Hebrew are joined to prepositions expressing
those cases (?? sign of the dative, ?? in, ??? from, § 102), e.g. ?? to him (ei) and to himself
(sibi), ?? in him, ????? (usually

) from me.

????????

3. The suffixes of the 2nd person (?? ??, &c.) are all formed with a k-sound, not, like

the separate pronouns of the 2nd person, with a t-sound.

So in all the Semitic languages, in Ethiopic even in the verbal form (qatalka, thou hast

killed=Hebr.

?????????

).

4. The suffix of the verb (the accusative) and the suffix of the noun (the genitive)

coincide in most forms, but some differ, e.g. ???? me, ? ?? my.

Paradigm A at the end of the Grammar gives a table of all the forms of the separate
pronoun and the suffixes; a fuller treatment of the verbal suffix and the mode of attaching it to
the verb will be found in § 58 ff., of the noun-suffix in § 91, of the prepositions with suffixes
in § 103, of adverbs with suffixes § 100 o.

f.

Rem. 1. The feminine form ???? has undoubtedly arisen from ????, by obscuring of an
original â to ô (for ??? = ??? cf. the Arab. hâ-?â, this, masc.; for ? as the feminine ending, § 80),
and the forms ???, ??, both of which are rare,3 are shortened from ????. In Ps 132:12 ?? is used
as a relative, cf. ?? below. In Jer 26:6, Keth??bh, ???????? (with the article and the demonstrative
termination ? ??) is found for ????. The forms ????? and ??? are the plurals of ??? and ???? by usage,
though not etymologically. The form ??? occurs only in the Pentateuch (but not in the
Samaritan text), Gn 19:8, 25, 26:3, 4, &c. (8 times), always with the article, ????? [as well as
?????, ??????? frequently], and in 1 Ch 20:8 without the article [cf. Driver on Dt 4:42].4 Both the
singular and the plural may refer to things as well as persons.

2. In combination with prepositions to denote the oblique case we find ????? to this (cf. for
??, § 102 g), ??????, ?????? to this (fem.),
??????
????????
,
hos, also without ????, even before the verb Ps 75:8, &c. Note also ??? ?????? pretium huius (1 K
21:2), &c.

 to these; ??????? hunc, ???????? hanc,

????????

????

2. The secondary form ?? occurs only in poetic style, and mostly for the relative,
like our that for who [see Lexicon., s. v.]. Like ? ???? (§ 36), it serves for all numbers
and genders.

Rem. 1. This pronoun takes the article (?????, ??????,

????????

, ??????) according to the same rule

as adjectives, see § 126 u; e.g. ????? ??????? this man, but ?????? ??? this is the man.

2. Rarer secondary forms, with strengthened demonstrative force, are ??????? Gn 24:65,

???????

 fem. Ez 36:35; and shortened ?????, sometimes masc., as in Ju 6:20, 1 S 17:26, 2 K

37:19;
23:17, Zc 2:8, Dn 8:16, sometimes fem., 2 K 4:25: cf. 1 S 14:1 [and 20:19 LXX; see
Commentaries and Kittel].

3. The personal pronouns of the 3rd person also often have a demonstrative sense, see §

136.

1 1 In many languages the demonstratives begin with a d-sound (hence called the
demonstrative sound) which, however, sometimes interchanges with a sibilant. Cf.
Aram.  ??? , ???? masc., ???, ???? fem. (this); Sansk. sa, s?, tat; Gothic sa, sô, thata; Germ.
da, der, die, das; and Eng. the, this, that, &c. Cf. J. Barth, ‘Zum semit. Demonstr. ?, ’
in ZDMG. 59, 159 ff., and 633 ff.; Sprachwiss. Untersuchungen zum Semit., Lpz.
1907, p. 30 ff. [See the Lexicon., s. v. ???, and Aram. ??, ??.]
2 2 That ??? may stand for the feminine, cannot be proved either from Ju 16:28 or from
the certainly corrupt passage in Jos 2:17.
3 3 ??? 2 K 6:19, and in seven other places; ?? only in Hos 7:16, Ps 132:12.
4 4 According to Kuenen (cf. above, § 2 n) and Driver, on Lev 18:27 in Haupt’s Bible,
this ??? is due to an error of the punctuators. It goes back to a time when the vowel of
the second syllable was not yet indicated by a vowel letter, and later copyists wrongly
omitted the addition of the ?. In Phoenician also it was written ??, but pronounced ily
according to Plautus, Poen, v, 1, 9.

§ 35. The Article.

J. Barth, ‘Der heb. u. der aram. Artikel, ’ in Sprachwiss. Untersuch. zum Semit., Lpz.
1907, p. 47 ff.

1. The article, which is by nature a kind of demonstrative pronoun, never appears

in Hebrew as an independent word, but always in closest connexion with the word
which is defined by it. It usually takes the form ??, with ? and a strengthening of the
????
next consonant, e.g.
20 m for ???????, ?????????).

 the sun, ??????? the river, ?????????? the Levites (according to §

?????

Rem. With regard to the Dageš in ?? after the article, the rule is, that it is inserted when a ?

or ? follows the ?? e.g. ?????????? the Jews, ?????????? the weary (?????????? La 4:3 Qerê is an exception),
but ???????, ??????????, ???????, &c. Dageš forte also stands after the article in the prefix ??   in certain
nouns and in the participles Pi?l and Pual (see § 52 c) before ?, ? and ?, except when the
guttural (or ?) has under it a short vowel in a sharpened syllable; thus ????????? Ez 22:5, ?????????
the cave, ?????????? Ps 37:1 (cf. Jb 38:40, 1 Ch 4:41); but ??????????? Ps 104:3 (Ec 4:15, 2 Ch 23:12;
before ?? Ps 103:4); ????????????? Is 23:12; ????????????? Jos 6:22. Before letters other than gutturals
this ?? remains without Dageš, according to § 20 m.

2. When the article stands before a guttural, which (according to § 22 b) cannot
properly be strengthened, the following cases arise, according to the character of the
guttural (cf. § 27 q).

(1) In the case of the weakest guttural, ?, and also with ? (§ 22 c and q), the
strengthening is altogether omitted. Consequently, the Patha? of the article (since it
stands in an open syllable) is always lengthened to Qame?; e.g. ???? the father, ???????
the other, ????? the mother, ?????? the man, ????? the light, ??????????? ? ????,
 the foot,
?????? the head, ? ??????? the wicked.

????????

So also ??? ????? Neh 3:13, because syncopated from ??? ?????? (cf. verse 14 and Baer
on the passage); ?????????? (as in Nu 11:4, Ju 9:41, 2 S 23:33, with the ? orthographically
retained), for ??????? Jer 40:4 (cf. ?????? verse 1);
22:5 for ???????(cf. 2 K 8:28).

 Ec 4:14 for ???????; ????????? 2 Ch

???????

??

(2) In the case of the other gutturals either the virtual strengthening takes place (§

22 c)—especially with the stronger sounds ? and ?, less often with ?—or the
strengthening is wholly omitted. In the former case, the Patha? of the article remains,
because the syllable is still regarded as closed; in the second case, the Patha? is either
modified to Seghôl or fully lengthened to Qame?. That is to say:—

A. When the guttural has any other vowel than ? (??) or ? (??), then

(1) before the stronger sounds ? and ? the article regularly remains ??; e.g. ?????
????????

 the force, ????????? the wisdom. Before ?, ? occurs only in
 Is 3:22, ??????????? Is 17:8 [not elsewhere]; before

 the month,

???????

?????

????????
that,
????? Gn 6:19 [not elsewhere],
????????
?, always in

, ?????.

????????

(2) before ? the Patha? is generally lengthened to Qame?, e.g.

 the eye, ??????
 the servant, plur. ???????????; ??????????? 1 K 12:32; also in Gn 10:17 ?????????? is
????????

the city,
the better reading. Exceptions are
 Ex 15:10, ??????????? 2 S 5:6, 8, Is 42:18,
????
Is 24:2, ??????????? Is 65:11,
16:7, Ec 11:7; but ???????? Gn 3:6, Pr 10:26. Cf. Baer on Is 42:18.

????? ??  Ez 22:7, ??????????? Pr 2:13 and

 Pr 2:17, ??????????? 1 S

????????

???????

??????

????

B. When the guttural has ? (??) then

(1) immediately before a tone-bearing ?? or ?? the article is always ??, otherwise it is

??; e.g. ????? the people, ????? the mountain,
mountain; but (according to § 22 c)

???????

????????

???

 (in pause) the eye,

????????

 towards the

 the mountains, ??????? the iniquity.

(2) before ?? the article is invariably ?? without regard to the tone; e.g. ???????? the

wise man,  ??????

 the festival.

C. When the guttural has ?? the article is ?? before ?? e.g. ?? ????????? the months;
?????????? in the waste places (without the article ?????? b??or?bhôth) Ez 33:27, ??????????
Ez 36:35, 38, cf. 2 Ch 27:4; but ?? before ??, as ??????????? the sheaves Ru 2:15.

The gender and number of the noun have no influence on the form of the article.

Rem. 1. The original form of the Hebrew (and the Phoenician) article  ??·  is generally
considered to have been ???, the ? of which (owing to the proclitic nature of the article) has
been invariably assimilated to the following consonant, as in ????? from yilqa?, § 19 d. This
view was supported by the form of the Arabic article ?? (pronounced hal by some modern
Beduin), the ? of which is also assimilated at least before all letters like s and t and before l, n,
and r, e.g. ’al-Qur’ân but ’as-sá?n? (Beduin has-sana)=Hebr. ???????? the year. But Barth (Amer.
Journ. of Sem. Laug., 1896, p. 7 ff.), following Hupfeld and Stade, has shown that the Hebrew
article is to be connected rather with the original Semitic demonstrative h?, 1 cf. Arab. h??a,
Aram. h?d?n, &c. The sharpening of the following consonant is to be explained exactly like
the sharpening after ?? consecutive (§ 49 f; cf. also cases like ?????, ?????, &c., § 102 k), from the
close connexion of the ha with the following word, and the sharpening necessarily involved
the shortening of the vowel.2

The Arabic article is supposed to occur in the Old Testament in ????????? 1 K 10:11, 12 (also

????????? 2 Ch 2:7, 9:10, 11), sandal-wood (?), and in ?????????? hail, ice=?????? (Arab. ?ibs) Ez
13:11, 13, 38:22, but this explanation can hardly be correct. On the other hand, in the proper
name ???????? Gn 10:26 the first syllable is probably ??? God, as suggested by D. H. Müller (see
Lexicon, s. v.) and Nöldeke, Sitzungsber. der Berl. Akad., 1882, p. 1186. ?????? Pr 30:31,
commonly explained as=Arab. al-qaum, the militia, is also quite uncertain.

1 1 An original form han, proposed by Ungnad, ‘Der hebr. Art., ’ in OLZ. x (1907),
col. 210 f., and ZDMG. 1908, p. 80 ff., is open to grave objections.
2 2 In the Li?yanitic inscriptions collected by Euting (ed. by D. H. Müller in
Epigraphische Denkmäler aus Arabien, Wien, 1889) the article is ?, and also in a
North Arabian dialect, according to E. Littmann, Safa-inschriften, p. 2, Rem., and p.
34.

????

?????????

 (so Ps 36:6); ????? for ??????? to the people, ????????? on the mountains, ?? ?????????

2. When the prefixes ??, ??, ??   (§ 102) come before the article, the ? is elided, and its vowel
 in the

is thrown back to the prefix, in the place of the Šewâ (§ 19 k, and § 23 k), e.g.
heaven for
in the months; also in Is 41:2, read ???????? instead of the impossible ????????. Exceptions to this
rule occur almost exclusively in the later Books: Ez 40:25, 47:22, Ec 8:1, Dn 8:16, Neh 9:19,
12:33, 2 Ch 10:7, 25:10, 29:27; cf., however, 1 S 13:21, 2 S 21:20. Elsewhere, e.g. 2 K 7:12,
the Masora requires the elision in the Qerê. A distinction in meaning is observed between
??????? about this time (Gn 39:11, 1 S 9:13, &c.) and ????? first of all (Gn 25:31, &c.). After the
copula ?? (and) elision of the ? does not take place, e.g. ???????.

???????

????

3. The words

??????  earth, ??? mountain, ??? feast, ??? people, ??? bull, always appear after the

???????
article with a long vowel (as in pause);
absol. st. in 2 K 12:10, 2 Ch 24:8, but to be read ????), with the article always ???????.

, ?????, ?????, ?????, ?????; cf. also ????? ark (so in the

§ 36. The Relative Pronoun.

The relative pronoun (cf. § 138) is usually the indeclinable ? ???? (who, which, &c.),

originally a demonstrative pronoun; see further §§ 138 and 155. In the later books,
especially Eccles. and the late Psalms, also Lam. (4 times), Jon. (17), Chron. (twice),
Ezra (once),—and always in the Canticle (cf. also Ju 7:12, 8:26, 2 K 6:11),  ??·
 is used
instead; more rarely  ??·
 Ju 5:7, Ct 1:7 (Jb 19:29?); once  ?? before ? Ju 6:17 (elsewhere
?? before a guttural), before ? even  ?? Ec 3:18, and according to some (e.g. Qim?i) also
in Ec 2:22.3 [See Lexicon, s. v.]

§ 37. The Interrogative and Indefinite Pronouns.

1. The interrogative pronoun is ??? who? (of persons, even before plurals, Gn 33:5,

Is 60:8, 2 K 18:35, and sometimes also of things Gn 33:8, Ju 13:17, Mi 1:5; cf. also
??????? whose daughter? Gn 24:23; ????? to whom? ??????? whom?)—???, ??? (see b) what?
(of things).—??????? which? what?

The form  ???·

,  ?? · , &c. (followed by Dageš forte conjunct.: even in ??, Hb 2:1, &c., against §

20 m) may be explained (like the art.  ??·  § 35 l, and  ??·  in the imperf. consec.) from the rapid
utterance of the interrogative in connexion with the following word. Most probably, however,
the Dageš forte is rather due to the assimilation of an originally audible ? (???, as Olshausen),
which goes back through the intermediate forms math, mat to an original mant: so W. Wright,
Comparative Grammar, Cambridge, 1890, p. 124, partly following Böttcher, Hebräische
Grammatik, § 261. A ground-form mant would most easily explain ??? (what?), used in Ex
16:15 in explanation of ??? manna, while ??? is the regular Aramaic for who. Socin calls
attention to the Arabic mah (in pause with an audible h: Mufa??al, 193, 8). Observe further
that—

(a) In the closest connexion, by means of Maqqeph, ???? takes a following Dageš (§ 20 d),

e.g. ???????? what is it to thee? and even in one word, as ??????? what is it to you? Is 3:15; cf. Ex
4:2, Mal 1:13, and even before a guttural, ??? Ez 8:6 Keth??bh.

3 3 The full form ??? does not occur in Phoenician, but only ?? (= ????·
?), pronounced
asse, esse (also as, es, is, ys, us), or—especially in the later Punic and in the Poenulus
of Plautus—? (sa, si, sy, su). Also in New Hebrew  ??·
 has become the common form.
Cf. Schröder, Phön. Sprache, p. 162 ff. and below, § 155; also Bergsträsser, ‘Das
hebr. Präfix ?, ’ in ZAW. 1909, p. 40 ff.

(b) Before gutturals in close connexion, by means of Maqqeph or (e.g. Ju 14:18, 1 S 20:1)

a conjunctive accent, either ??? is used with a virtual strengthening of the guttural (§ 22 c), so
especially before ?, and, in Gn 31:36, Jb 21:21, before ??—or the doubling is wholly emitted.
In the latter case either (cf. § 35 e–k) ? is fully lengthened to Qames (so always before the ?
, and so ? (Hb 2:18), ? (2 S 18:22, 2 K
?????? ,
of the article, except in Ec 2:12; also before
8:14), ? (Gn 31:22, 2 K 8:13), or modified to Seghôl, especially before ??, ??, and generally
before ??. The omission of the strengthening also takes place as a rule with ?, ?, ?, when they
have not Qame?, and then the form is either ??? or ???, the latter especially before ? or ?, if
Maqqeph follows.

??????

The longer forms ??? and ??? are also used (??? even before letters which are not gutturals)
when not connected by Maqqeph but only by a conjunctive accent. As a rule ??? is then used,
but sometimes ??? when at a greater distance from the principal tone of the sentence, Is 1:5, Ps
4:3. (On ??? in the combinations ?????, ?????, and even

?????? , 1 S 1:8, cf. § 102 k and l.)

(c) In the principal pause ??? is used without exception; also as a rule with the smaller
disjunctives, and almost always before gutturals (??? only in very few cases). On the other
hand, ??? more often stands before letters which are not gutturals, when at a greater distance
from the principal tone of the sentence, e.g. 1 S 4:6, 15:14, 2 K 1:7, Hag 1:9 (see Köhler on
the passage), Ps 10:13, Jb 7:21; cf., however, Pr 31:2, and Delitzsch on the passage.

2. On ??? and ??? as indefinite pronouns in the sense of quicunque, quodcunque, and

as relatives, is qui, id quod, &c., see § 137 c.

CHAPTER II

THE VERB

§ 38. General View

Verbal stems are either original or derived. They are usually divided into—

(a) Verbal stems proper (primitive verbs), which exhibit the stem without any

addition, e.g. ?????? he has reigned.

(b) Verbal derivatives, i.e. secondary verbal stems, derived from the pure stem
(letter a), e.g. ????? to sanctify, ????????? to sanctify oneself, from ????? to be holy. These
are usually called conjugations (§ 39).

(c) Denominatives,1 i.e. verbs derived from nouns (like the Latin causari,
praedari, and Eng. to skin, to stone), or even from particles (see d, end) either in a
primitive or derivative form, e.g. ????, Qal and Pi??l, to pitch a tent, from
 tent;
???? ???? and ????? to take root, and ??? ?? to root out, from ????? root (§ 52 h).

??????

This does not exclude the possibility that, for nouns, from which denominative verbs are

derived, the corresponding (original) verbal stem may still be found either in Hebrew or in the
dialects. The meaning, however, is sufficient to show that the denominatives have come from
the noun, not from the verbal stem, e.g. ??????? a brick (verbal stem ??? to be white), denomin.

§ 39. Ground-form and Derived Stems

Brockelmann, Sem. Sprachwiss., p. 119 ff.; Grundriss, p. 504 ff.

1. The 3rd sing. masc. of the Perfect in the form of the pure stem (i.e. in Qal, see
e) is generally regarded, lexicographically and grammatically, as the ground-form of
the verb (§ 30 a), e.g. ????? he has killed, ????? he was heavy, ????? he was little.2 From
this form the other persons of the Perfect are derived, and the Participle also is
connected with it. ????? or ?????, like the Imperative and Infinitive construct in sound,
may also be regarded as an alternative ground-form, with which the Imperfect (see §
47) is connected.

In verbs ??? (i.e. with ? for their second radical) the stem-form, given both in Lexicon and
Grammar, is not the 3rd sing. masc. Perfect (consisting of two consonants), but the form with
medial ?, which appears in the Imperative and Infinitive; e.g. ??? to return (3rd pers. perf. ? ??):
the same is the case in most stems with medial ?, e.g. ???? to judge.

2. From the pure stem, or Qal, the derivative stems are formed according to an
unvarying analogy, in which the idea of the stem assumes the most varied shades of
meaning, according to the changes in its form (intensive, frequentative, privative,
causative, reflexive, reciprocal; some of them with corresponding passive forms), e.g.
????? to learn, ????? to teach; ??? ?? to lie, ???? ???? to lay; ??? ?? to judge, ??? ???? to contend. In
other languages such formations are regarded as new or derivative verbs, e.g. Germ.
fallen (to fall), fällen (to fell); trinken (to drink), tränken (to drench); Lat. lactere (to
suck, Germ. saugen), lactare (to suckle, Germ. säugen); iac?re (to throw), iac?re (to
lie down); ????µ??, ??????. In Hebrew, however, these formations are incomparably
more regular and systematic than (e.g.) in Greek, Latin, or English; and, since the
time of Reuchlin, they have usually been called conjugations of the primitive form
(among the Jewish grammarians ??????????, i.e. formations, or more correctly species), and
are always treated together in the grammar and lexicon.1

3. The changes in the primitive form consist either in internal modification by
means of vowel-change and strengthening of the middle consonant (?????, ?????; ?????,
?????; cf. to lie, to lay; to fall, to fell), or in the repetition of one or two of the stem-
consonants (???????, ?????????), or finally in the introduction of formative additions (???????),
which may also be accompanied by internal change (????????, ?????????). Cf. § 31 b.

In Aramaic the formation of the conjugations is effected more by formative additions than

by vowel-change. The vocalic distinctions have mostly become obsolete, so that, e.g. the

2 2 For the sake of brevity, however, the meaning in Hebrew-English Lexicons is
usually given in the Infinitive, e.g. ????? to learn, properly he has learnt.
1 1 The term Conjugation thus has an entirely different meaning in Hebrew and Greek
or Latin grammar.

reflexives with the prefix ????, ????, ???? have entirely usurped the place of the passives. On the
other hand, Arabic has preserved great wealth in both methods of formation, while Hebrew in
this, as in other respects, holds the middle place (§ 1 m).

4. Grammarians differ as to the number and arrangement of these conjugations.

The common practice, however, of calling them by the old grammatical terms,
prevents any misunderstanding. The simple form is called Qal (??? light, because it has
no formative additions); the others (???????? heavy, being weighted, as it were, with the
strengthening of consonants or with formative additions) take their names from the
paradigm of ????? he has done, 1 which was used in the earliest Jewish grammatical
works. Several of these have passives which are distinguished from their actives by
more obscure vowels. The common conjugations (including Qal and the passives) are
the seven following, but very few verbs exhibit them all:

Active.

3. Pi??l

1. Qal
2. Niph?al

????? to kill.
??????? to kill oneself (rarely
passive).
????? to kill many, to
massacre.
5. Hiph?îl
???????? to cause to kill.
7. Hithpa??l   ????????? to kill oneself.

Passive.
(Cf. § 52 e.)

4. Pu?al?????.

6. Hoph?al ???????.
[Very rare, Hothpa?al ?????????.]

There are besides several less frequent conjugations, some of which, however, are

more common in the kindred languages, and even in Hebrew (in the weak verb)
regularly take the place of the usual conjugations (§ 55).

In Arabic there is a greater variety of conjugations, and their arrangement is more
appropriate. According to the Arabic method, the Hebrew conjugations would stand thus: 1.
Qal; 2. Pi??l and Pu?al; 3. Pô??l and Pô?al (see § 55 b); 4. Hiph???l and Hoph?al; 5. Hithpa??l
and Hothpa?al; 6. Hithpô??l (see § 55 b); 7. Niph?al; 8. Hithpa??l (see § 54 l); 9. Pi?l?l (see §
55 d). A more satisfactory division would be into three classes: (1) The intensive Pi??l with
the derived and analogous forms Pu?al and Hithpa??l. (2) The causative Hiph???l with its
passive Hoph?al, and the analogous forms (Šaph??l and Tiph??l). (3) The reflexive or passive
Niph?al.

1 1 This paradigm was borrowed from the Arabic grammarians, and, according to
Bacher, probably first adopted throughout by Abulwalîd. It was, however, unsuitable
on account of the guttural, and was, therefore, usually exchanged in later times for
?????, after the example of Moses Qim?i. This verb has the advantage, that all its
conjugations are actually found in the Old Testament. On the other hand, it has the
disadvantage of indistinctness in the pronunciation of some of its forms, e.g. ????????,
?????????. The paradigm of ?????, commonly used since the time of Danz, avoids this
defect, and is especially adapted for the comparative treatment of the Semitic dialects,
inasmuch as it is found with slight change (Arab. and Ethiop. ???) in all of them. It is
true that in Hebrew it occurs only three times in Qal, and even then only in poetic
style (Ps 139:19, Jb 13:15, 24:14); yet it is worth retaining as a model which has been
sanctioned by usage. More serious is the defect, that a number of forms of the
paradigm of ??? leave the beginner in doubt as to whether or not there should be a
Dageš in the Begadkephath letters, and consequently as to the correct division of the
syllables.

§ 40. Tenses. Moods. Flexion

A. Ungnad, ‘Die gegenseitigen Beziehungen der Verbalformen im Grundstamm des
semit. Verbs,’ in ZDMG. 59 (1905), 766 ff., and his ‘Zum hebr. Verbalsystem’, in
Beiträge zur Assyriologie ed. by Fr. Delitzsch and P. Haupt, 1907, p. 55 ff.

1. While the Hebrew verb, owing to these derivative forms or conjugations,
possesses a certain richness and copiousness, it is, on the other hand, poor in the
matter of tenses and moods. The verb has only two tense-forms (Perfect and
Imperfect, see the note on § 47 a), besides an Imperative (but only in the active), two
Infinitives and a Participle. All relations of time, absolute and relative, are expressed
either by these forms (hence a certain diversity in their meaning, § 106 ff.) or by
syntactical combinations. Of moods properly so called (besides the Imperfect
Indicative and Imperative), only the Jussive and Optative are sometimes indicated by
express modifications of the Imperfect-form (§ 48).

2. The inflexion of the Perfect, Imperfect, and Imperative as to persons, differs
from that of the Western languages in having, to a great extent, distinct forms for the
two genders, which correspond to the different forms of the personal pronoun. It is
from the union of the pronoun with the verbal stem that the personal inflexions of
these tenses arise.

The following table will serve for the beginner as a provisional scheme of the
formative syllables (afformatives and preformatives) of the two tenses. The three
stem-consonants of the strong verb are denoted by dots. Cf. § 44 ff. and the
Paradigms.

§ 41. Variations from the Ordinary Form of the Strong Verb.

The same laws which are normally exhibited in stems with strong (unchangeable)

consonants, hold good for all other verbs. Deviations from the model of the strong
verb are only modifications due to the special character or weakness of certain
consonants, viz. :—

(a) When one of the stem-consonants (or radicals) is a guttural. In this case,
however, the variations only occur in the vocalization (according to § 22), not in the
consonants. The guttural verbs (§§ 62–65) are, therefore, only a variety of the strong
verb.

(b) When a stem-consonant (radical) disappears by assimilation (§ 19 b–f), or
when the stem originally, consisted of only two consonants (verbs ???, ???, and ???, as
?????, ???, ???, §§ 66, 67, 72).

(c) When one of the stem-consonants (radicals) is a weak letter. In this case,
through aphaeresis, elision, &c., of the weak consonant, various important deviations
from the regular form occur. Cf. § 68 ff. for these verbs, such as ? ????, ?????, ?????.

Taking the old paradigm ????? as a model, it is usual, following the example of the Jewish

grammarians, to call the first radical of any stem ?, the second ?, and the third ?. Hence the
expressions, verb ??? for a verb whose first radical is ? (primae radicalis [sc. literae] ?); ???
for mediae radicalis ?; ??? for a verb whose second radical is repeated to form a third.

The Strong Verb.

§ 42.

As the formation of the strong verb is the model also for the weak verb, a statement of the

general formative laws should precede the treatment of special cases.

Paradigm B, together with the Table of the personal preformatives and afformatives given
in § 40 c, offers a complete survey of the normal forms. A full explanation of them is given in
the following sections (§§ 43–55), where each point is elucidated on its first occurrence; thus
e.g. the inflexion of the Perfect, the Imperfect and its modifications, will be found under Qal,
&c.

THE PURE STEM, OR QAL.

§ 43. Its Form and Meaning.

The common form of the 3rd sing. masc. of the Perfect Qal is ?????, with ?

(Patha?) in the second syllable, especially in transitive verbs (but see § 44 c). There
is also a form with ? (?ere, originally ??), and another with ? (?olem, originally ?) in
the second syllable, both of which, however, have almost always an intransitive1
meaning, and serve to express states and qualities, e.g. ????? to be heavy, ????? to be
small.

In Paradigm B a verb middle a, a verb middle ?, and a verb middle ? are accordingly
given side by side. The second example ????? is chosen as showing, at the same time, when the
Dageš lene is to be inserted or omitted.

1 1 But cf. such instances as Jer 48:5. In Arabic also, transitive verbs are found with
middle ?(cid:31), corresponding to Hebrew verbs with ? in the second syllable. Hence P.
Haupt (Proc. Amer. Or. Soc., 1894, p. ci f.) prefers to distinguish them as verba
voluntaria (actions which depend on the will of the subject) and involuntaria (actions
or states independent of the will of the subject).

Rem. 1. The vowel of the second syllable is the principal vowel, and hence on it depends

the distinction between the transitive and intransitive meaning. The Qame? of the first
syllable is lengthened from an original ? (cf. Arabic q?t?l?), but it can be retained in Hebrew
only immediately before the tone, or at the most (with an open ultima) in the counter-tone
with Metheg; otherwise, like all the pretonic vowels (?, ?), it becomes Šewâ, e.g.
 2nd
plur. masc. In the Aramaic dialects the vowel of the first syllable is always reduced to Šewâ,
as ?????=Hebr. ?????. The intransitive forms in Arabic are q?t??l?, q?t?l?; in Hebrew (after the
rejection of the final vowel) ?? being in the tone-syllable has been regularly lengthened to ?,
and ? to ?.

????????

??

2. Examples of denominatives in Qal are: ????? to cover with pitch, from ????? pitch ; ????? to
??????  corn; see above, § 38 c.

??????  salt; ??? ?? (usually Hiph.) to buy or sell corn, from

salt, from

§ 44. Flexion of the Perfect of Qal.1

1. The formation of the persons of the Perfect is effected by the addition of certain

forms of the personal pronoun, and marks of the 3rd fem. sing. and 3rd pl. (as
afformatives) to the end of the verbal-stem, which contains the idea of a predicate, and
may be regarded, in meaning if not in form, as a Participle or verbal adjective. For
the 3rd pers. sing. masc. Perfect, the pronominal or subject idea inherent in the finite
verb is sufficient: thus, ????? he has killed,
?????
thou, or a killer thou), a killer wast thou=???? ???; ????? he was fearing, ???????? ye were
fearing=???? ????. The ending of the 1st pers. plur. (???) is also certainly connected with
the termination of
, ??? we (§ 32 b, d). The afformative of the 1st pers. sing. (???)
is to be referred, by an interchange of ?   and ? (cf. § 33 f), to that form of the pronoun
which also underlies ???????, I.2 In the third person ? ?? (originally ? ??, cf. below, f) is the
mark of the feminine, as in a great number of nouns (§ 80 c), and ? is the termination
of the plural; cf., for the latter, the termination of the 3rd and 2nd pers. plur. Imperf.
ûna in Arabic and û (often also ??) in Hebrew, also ûna (in the construct state û) as the
plural termination of masc. nouns in literary Arabic.

Rem. 1. Verbs middle ? in Hebrew (as in Ethiopic, but not in Arabic or Aramaic)
generally change the E-sound in their inflexion into Patha? (frequently so even in the 3rd
sing. masc. Perf.). This tendency to assimilate to the moro common verbs middle a may also

1 1 Cf. Nöldeke, ‘Die Endungen des Perfects’ (Untersuchungen zur semit. Gramm.
ii.), in ZDMG. vol. 38, p. 407 ff., and more fully in Beiträge zur sem. Sprachwiss.,
Strassb. 1904, p. 15 ff.
2 2 According to Nöldeke, l.c., p. 419, the original Semitic termination of the 1st sing.
Perf. was most probably kû; cf. the Ethiopic qatalku, Arabic qataltu.

be explained from the laws of vocalization of the tone-bearing closed penultima, which does
not readily admit of ?ere, and never of ?ireq, of which the ?ere is a lengthening (cf. § 26 p).
On the other hand, ?ere is retained in an open syllable; regularly so in the weak stems ??? (§
74 g), before suffixes (§ 59 i), and in the pausal forms of the strong stem in an open tone-
syllable, e.g.
29 q) in a closed pausal syllable, e.g. ??? ??, Dt 33:12 (out of pause ??? ??, Is 32:16); but

2. In some weak stems middle a, the Patha? under the second radical sometimes, in a
closed toneless syllable, becomes ??, and, in one example, ??. Thus from ?????: ??? ???????? and thou
shalt possess it, Dt 17:14; ??? ???????? Dt 19:1; ??? ???????? Dt 4:1, and frequently; from ????? to bring
forth, to beget;
?? ??; ??????? ?? I have asked him, 1 S 1:20 (Ju 13:6), and three times ??????? ?? 1 S 12:13, 25:5, Jb
21:29. Qim?i already suggests the explanation, that the ?? (?) of these forms of ??? and ??? is
the original vowel, since along with ?? ?? and ????? are also found ??? ?? and ????? (see the
Lexicon). The possibility of this explanation cannot be denied (especially in the case of ?????,
see § 69 s); the ?? in these forms might, however, equally well have arisen from an attenuation
of ? (§ 27 s), such as must in any case be assumed in the other instances. Moreover, it is
worthy of notice that in all the above cases the ?? is favoured by the character of the following
consonant (a sibilant or dental), and in most of them also by the tendency towards
assimilation of the vowels (cf. § 54 k and § 64 f).

3. In verbs middle ?, the ?olem is retained in the tone-syllable, e.g.

????(cid:31)????

 thou didst

 in pause for ??????? they were able; but in a toneless closed syllable the original
 I have prevailed against him, Ps
???

????????

????

???

tremble;
short vowel appears in the form of a Qame? ha?uph;
13:5;  ???????????
?
becomes vocal Šewâ, e.g. ????????, ???????.

 (see § 49 h) then shalt thou be able, Ex 18:23; in a toneless open syllable it

????

?? ??????

4. Rarer forms1 are: Sing. 3rd fem. in ? ?? (as in Arabic, Ethiopic, and Aramaic), e.g. ??????? it
 Is 23:15 (in the Aramaic form, for ????? ??????); from a verb ???, ??? ????, cf.
is gone, Dt 32:36;
§ 72 o. This original feminine ending -ath is regularly retained before suffixes, see § 59 a; and
similarly in stems ???, either in the form ?th (which is frequent also in stems ??? § 74 g), or
with the Patha? weakened to vocal Šewâ before the pleonastic ending ? ??, e.g. ???????? § 75 i. In
Ez 31:5 the Aramaic form ???????? occurs instead of ????????.

2nd masc. ??? for ?? (differing only orthographically), e.g.

treacherously, Mal 2:14; cf. 1 S 15:3, Gn 3:12 (
66 h); Gn 21:23, 2 S 2:26, 2 K 9:3, Is 2:6, Ps 56:9 (so also in Hiphil; 2 K 9:7, Is 37:23, Ps
60:4).

1 1Many of these forms, which are uncommon in Hebrew, are usual in the other

forms.

the corresponding pronoun ???? (????) § 32 h. The ordinary form has rejected the final i, but it
regularly reappears when pronominal suffixes are added (§ 59 a, c).

1st pers. comm. sometimes without Yodh, as

(all in Kethîbh), Ps 16:2, without a Qerê; in 2 K 18:20 also
from Is 36:5. The Qerê requires the ordinary form, to which the vowels of the text properly
belong, whilst the Kethîbh is probably to be regarded as the remains of an earlier orthography,
which omitted vowel-letters even at the end of the word.

doubtful form ????? Is 26:16; on ?? in the Imperf. see § 47 m; on the affixed ? in Jos 10:24, Is
28:12, see § 23 i.

It is very doubtful whether, as in most Semitic languages (see § 47 c, note), the 3rd.fem.
plur. in Hebrew was originally distinguished from the 3rd masc. plur. by the termination ? ??,
as in Biblical Aramaic. Nöldeke (ZDMG. 38 [1884], p. 411) referred doubtfully to the textual

§ 45. The Infinitive.

1. The Infinitive is represented in Hebrew by two forms, a shorter and a longer;
both are, however, strictly speaking, independent nouns (verbal substantives). The
shorter form, the Infinitive construct (in Qal ?????, 1 sometimes incorrectly ?????), is
used in very various ways, sometimes in connexion with pronominal suffixes, or
governing a substantive in the genitive, or with an accusative of the object (§ 115),
sometimes in connexion with prepositions (??????? to kill, § 114 f), and sometimes in
dependence upon substantives as genitive, or upon verbs as accusative of the object.
On the other hand, the use of the longer form, the Infinitive absolute (in Qal ?????,
sometimes also ?????, obscured from original q??âl), is restricted to those cases in
which it emphasizes the abstract verbal idea, without regard to the subject or object of
the action. It stands most frequently as an adverbial accusative with a finite verb of
the same stem (§ 113 h–s).1

The flexibility and versatility of the Infin. constr. and the rigidity and inflexibility

of the Infin. absol. are reflected in their vocalization. The latter has unchangeable
vowels, while the ? of the Infin. constr. may be lost. For ?????, according to § 84a, e,
goes back to the ground-form q???l.

Other forms of the Infin. constr. Qal of the strong verb are—

(a) ?????, e.g. ??? ?? to lie, Gn 34:7; ??? ?? to sink, Ec 12:4; especially with verbs which have ?
in the second syllable of the Imperf.: hence sometimes also with those, whose second or third
radical is a guttural (frequently besides the ordinary form). All the examples (except ??? ??, see
above) occur in the closest connexion with the following word, or with suffixes (see § 61 c).
 (verse 20, in pause ???????) as an Infinitive=????????;

????????

????????

(b) ??????? and, attenuated from it, ???????; ??????? and ??????? (which are feminine forms2 of ?????
and ?????, mostly from intransitive verbs, and sometimes found along with forms having no
feminine ending in use), e.g. ??? ????? to be guilty, Lv 5:26, ??????? to love, ???? ?? to hate; ????????,

1 1 Cf. the analogous forms of the noun, § 93 t.
1 1 The terms absolute and construct are of course not to be understood as implying
that the Infin. constr. ????? forms the construct state (see § 89) of the Infin. absol. (?????
ground-form q??âl). In the Paradigms the Inf. constr., as the principal form, is placed
before the other, under the name of Infinitive simply.
2 2 According to the remark of Elias Levita on Qim?i’s Mikhlol, ed. Rittenb., 14 a,
these feminine forms occur almost exclusively in connexion with the preposition ??.

often in Dt., to fear; ??????? to be old; ?????? to meet (in ???????? § 19 k); ????????? to lie down, Lv
20:16; ??? ?????? to anoint, Ex 29:29; ????????? to wash, Ex 30:18, &c.; ???????? (also a subst.=
uncleanness, like ??????) to be unclean, Lv 15:32; ????????? to approach, Ex 36:2, &c.; cf. Lv
12:4, 5, Dt 11:22, Is 30:19, Ez 21:16, Hag 1:6; also ???????? to be far off, Ez 8:6; ??????? to pity, Ez
16:5; cf. Ho 7:4. On the other hand in ??????? Gn 19:16, the original ? has been modified to ?;
cf. ??????? Is 8:11, &c.

(c) In the Aramaic manner (??????? but cf. also Arab. maqtal) there occur as Infin. Qal:
???? ???? to send, Est 9:19; ??????? to call and ????? to depart, Nu 10:2 (Dt 10:11); ????? to take, 2 Ch
19:7, &c.; ?????? to carry, Nu 4:24, &c. (cf. even ??? ?????? Ez 17:9); also with a feminine ending
???????? to go up, Ezr 7:9, &c.; cf. for these forms (almost all very late) Ryssel, De Elohistae
Pentateuchici sermone, p. 50, and Strack on Nu 4:24. Cf. also ????????? followed by ??, Is 13:19,
Am 4:11, (§ 115 d).

2. A kind of Gerund is formed by the Infin. constr. with the preposition ??; as ???????

ad interficiendum, ??????? ad cadendum (see § 28 a).

The blending of the ?? with the Infin. constr. into a single grammatical form seems to be
indicated by the firmly closed syllable, cf. ??? ???? Gn 34:7; ??????? Ps 118:13, with Dageš lene in

§ 46. The Imperative.

1. The ground-forms of the Imperative, ????? (properly qe??l, which is for an

?????  (see below, c), the same in pronunciation as the forms of the

original q???l), and
Infin. constr. (§ 45), are also the basis for the formation of the Imperfect (§ 47).1 They
represent the second person, and have both fem. and plur. forms. The third person is
supplied by the Imperfect in the Jussive (§ 109 b); and even the second person must
always be expressed by the Jussive, if it be used with a negative, e.g. ?????????? ne
occidas (not ????????). The passives have no Imperative, but it occurs in the reflexives,
as Niphal and Hithpa?l.2

2. The Afformatives of the 2nd sing. fem. and the 2nd plur. masc. and fem. are

identical in every case with those of the Imperfect (§ 47 c). In the same way, the
Imperative of the 2nd sing. masc., in common with the Imperfect, admits of the
lengthening by the ? ?? paragogicum (§ 48 i), as, on the other hand, there are certain
shortened forms of this person analogous to the Jussive (§ 48. 5).

Rem. 1. Instead of the form ????? (sometimes also plene, e.g. ??? ?? Ec 12:13; before
Maqqeph ?????? with Qame? ?a?uph), those verbs which have an a in the final syllable of the

1 1 The Infin. absol., like the Greek Infin., is also sometimes used for the Imperative
(§ 113 bb). Cf. in general, Koch, Der semitische Inf. (Schaffhausen, 1874).
2 2 In Hophal an Imperative is found only twice (Ez 32:19, Jer. 49:8), and closely
approximating in meaning to the reflexive.

Imperf. (i.e. especially verbs middle ?) make their Imperative of the form ?????, e.g. ?????? dress!
?? ????
(Perf. ????? and ?????); ??? ?? lie down! in pause

 1 S 3:5, 6, 9.

2. The first syllable of the sing. fem. and plur. masc. are usually to be pronounced with
Šewâ mobile (q???el??, q???elû, and so ????? ??, &c., without Dageš lene, and even ?? ????? with Metheg,
Ex 12:21; but cf. ??????? Jer 10:17, and with the same phonetic combination ??? ???? Is 47:2; see
analogous cases in § 93 m); less frequently we find an ? instead of the ??, e.g. ??????? rule, Ju
9:10; ?? ???? draw, Ez 32:20; ?????? Jer 2:12 (cf.
????????
22:20 (cf. 1 K 13:7), see § 10 h. This ? arises (see above, a) from a singular ground-form
q???l, not from a retraction of the original ? of the second syllable. We must abandon the
view that the forms with ?? in the first syllable (cf. also ???????,
??????? , ???????, ???????) arise from a
weakening of the characteristic vowel ?. They, or at least some of them, must rather be
regarded with Barth (ZDMG. 1889, p. 182) as analogous to the original ??-imperfects. See
further analogies in §§ 47 i and 48 i; 61 b, 63 n.

§ 47. The Imperfect and its Inflexion.

1. The persons of the Imperfect,1 in contradistinction to those of the Perfect, are
formed by placing abbreviated forms of the personal pronoun (preformatives) before

1 1 On the use of the Semitic Perfect and Imperfect cf. 106 ff. and the literature cited
in § 106. For our present purpose the following account will suffice :—The name
Imperfect is here used in direct contrast to the Perfect, and is to be taken in a wider
sense than in Latin and Greek grammar. The Hebrew (Semitic) Perf. denotes in
general that which is concluded, completed, and past, that which has happened and
has come into effect; but at the same time, also that which is represented as
accomplished, even though it be continued into present time or even be actually still
future. The Imperf. denotes, on the other hand, the beginning, the unfinished, and the
continuing, that which is just happening, which is conceived as in process of coming
to pass, and hence, also, that which is yet future; likewise also that which occurs
repeatedly or in a continuous sequence in the past (Latin Imperf.). It follows from the
above that the once common designation of the Imperf. as a Future emphasizes only
one side of its meaning. In fact, the use of Indo-Germanic tense-names for the Semitic
tenses, which was adopted by the Syrians under the influence of the Greek
grammarians, and after their example by the Arabs, and finally by Jewish scholars,
has involved many misconceptions. The Indo-Germanic scheme of three periods of
time (past, present, and future) is entirely foreign to the Semitic tense-idea, which
regards an occurrence only from the point of view of Completed or incomplete

the stem, or rather before the abstract form of the stem (?????). As, however, the tone is
retained on the characteristic vowel of the Stem-form, or even (as in the 2nd sing. fem.
and the 3rd and 2nd plur. masc.) passes over to the afformatives, the preformatives of
the Imperfect appear in a much more abbreviated form than the afformatives of the
Perfect, only one consonant (?, ?, ?, ? ) remaining in each form. But as this
preformative combined with the stem-form was not always sufficient to express at the
same time differences both of gender and number, the distinction had to be farther
indicated, in several cases, by special afformatives. Cf. the table, § 40 c.

2. The derivation and meaning, both of the preformatives and the afformatives,

can still, in most cases, be recognized.

In the first pers. ???????, plur. ???????, ? is probably connected with ?????, and ?  with
???????
; here no indication of gender or number by a special ending was necessary. As
regards the vocalization, the Arabic points to the ground-forms ?q??l and n?q??l: the ??
of the 1st plur. is, therefore, as in the other preformatives, attenuated from a. The
Seghôl of the 1st sing. is probably to be explained by the preference of the ? for this
sound (cf. § 22 o, but also § 51 p); according to Qim?i, it arises from an endeavour to
avoid the similarity of sound between ??????? (which is the Babylonian punctuation)
and ????????, which, according to this view, was likewise pronounced iq??l.1

The preformative ? of the second persons (???????, ground-form t?q??l, &c.) is,
without doubt, connected with the ? of ????, ????. &c., and the afformative ? ?? of the
2nd fem. sing. ????????? with the i of the original feminine form ???? (see § 32 h). The
afformative ? of the 2nd masc. plur. ???????? (in its more complete form, ??, see m) is the
sign of the plural, as in the 3rd pers., and also in the Perfect (§ 44 a). In the Imperfect,
however, it is restricted in both persons to the masculine,2 while the afformative ???
(also ??) of the 3rd and 2nd plur. fem. is probably connected with
???????
(fem.).

 eae and

??????

 vos

action.—In the formation of the two tenses the chief distinction is that in the Perfect
the verbal stem precedes and the indication of the person is added afterwards for
precision, while in the Imperf. the subject, from which the action proceeds or about
which a condition is predicated, is expressed by a prefixed pronoun.
1 1 Cf. § 24 e. In favour of the above view of Qim?i may be urged the phonetic
orthography ??? (in Pr 18:24 ????), 2 S 14:19 (unless, with Perles, ? ??? is to be read),
Mi 6:10, for ???, and ? ????? 1 Ch 2:13 for ? ???? (as verse 12). Also ?????????? Mi 6:11 is
probably for ???????? = ???????, ???? Is 10:12 for
???????
;
conversely ????? is for ????=??? ?? ????. Similarly, ???? 1 S 14:49 is probably for ?? ???? or
??? ????; in 2 S 23:8 ???? ??? is, according to the LXX, an error for ?????= (cid:31)? ????
Assyrian also the simple i corresponds to the Hebrew ? as the preformative of the
Impf. Qal.
2 2 This is also the proper gender of the plural syllable û, ûn. In Hebrew, indeed, it is
used in the 3rd plur. Perfect for both genders, but in the kindred languages even there
only for the masculine, e.g. in Syriac qe?álû, qe?álûn, with the feminine form qe?álên,
in Western Aram. qe?álû, fem. qe?ál?; in Arab. q?t?lû, fem. q?táln?, Eth. q?t?lû,
q?t?lâ.

Rem. 1. The ? of the second syllable (as in the inf. constr. and imperat.), being lengthened
from an original ? in the tone-syllable, is only tone-long (§ 9 r). Hence it follows that: (a) it is
incorrectly, although somewhat frequently, written plene; (b) before Maqqeph the short vowel
appears as Qame? ?a?uph, e.g. ?????????????? and he wrote there, Jos 8:32 (but cf. also Ex 21:37,
Jos 18:20); (c) it becomes Šewâ before the tone-bearing afformatives ? ?? and ? (see above, e;
but Jerome still heard e.g. iezbuleni for

; cf. ZAW. iv. 83).

????????

????

Quite anomalous are the three examples which, instead of a shortening to Šewâ, exhibit a
long û: ???? ???? ???? Ex 18:26, immediately before the principal pause, but according to Qim?i

2. The ? of the second syllable is to be found almost exclusively with transitive verbs
middle a, like ?????. Intransitives middle a and ? almost always take ? (Patha?)1 in the impf.,
e.g. ?????, ??????? to couch, ??? ??, ??? ???? to lie down (?????, ??????? to learn is also originally intransitive
= to accustom oneself); ?????, ??????? to become great (but cf. ??? ?? and ??? ?? imperf. ??? ???? to dwell
and to inhabit, ????? imperf. ????? to wither); also from verbs middle ?, as ????? to be small, the
imperf. has the form ???????.

Sometimes both forms occur together; those with ? having a transitive, and those with ?
an intransitive meaning, e.g. ??????? he cuts off, ??????? he is cut off, i.e. is short; ????? impf. ?, to
overcome, Ex 17:13; impf. ?, to be overcome, Jb 14:10. More rarely both forms are used
without any distinction, e.g. ??????? and ??????? he bites, ??????? and ??????? he is inclined (but only the
latter with a transitive meaning=he bends, in Jb 40:17). On the a of the impf. of verbs middle
and third guttural, cf. § 64 b; § 65 b. In some verbs first guttural (§ 63 n), ??? (§ 67 p), ??? (§
69 b), and ??? (§ 68 c), and in ????? for yint?n from ????? to give, instead of ? or ? a movable ?ere
(originally ??) is found in the second syllable. A trace of these i-imperfects2 in the ordinary
strong verb is probably to be found in
We call these three forms of the imperfect after their characteristic vowel impf. o, impf. a,
impf. e.

verbs third guttural (§ 65 b), it is to be found in ??? and ???, and in many verbs ??? and

21:18, 22:8, &c. This usually expresses marked emphasis, and consequently occurs
most commonly at the end of sentences (in the principal pause), in which case also the
(pausal) vowel of the second syllable is generally retained. Thus there arise full-
sounding forms such as  ???????

Some of these examples may be partly due to euphonic reasons, e.g. certainly Ex 17:2,

the pause especially which exerted an influence on the restoration of this older and fuller
termination (cf. § 159 c, note), as is manifest from Is 26:11:
may they see and become ashamed. All this applies also to the corresponding forms in the
Imperfect of the derived conjugations.1 In Aramaic and Arabic this earlier ?? (old Arabic ûn?)
is the regular termination; but in some dialects of vulgar Arabic it has also become û.

1 1 It is to be observed that the Chronicles often omit the Nûn, where it is found in the
parallel passage in the Books of Kings; cf. 1 K 8:38, 43 with 2 Ch 6:29, 33; 1 K
12:24, 2 K 11:5 with 2 Ch 11:4, 23:4.

???  Jer 10:5, evidently an error for

?? ???????, caused by the preceding ?????.—In ??? ???? Is 35:1, since ?   follows, the ? is no doubt only
due to dittography.

5. Corresponding to the use of ?? for ? there occurs in the 2nd sing. fem., although much

less frequently, the fuller ending ?? ?? (as in Aram. and Arab.; old Arab. ??n?), also always with
the tone, for ? ??, generally again in the principal pause, and almost in all cases with retention
of the vowel of the penultima; thus ?????????? Ru 2:8, 21, cf. 3:4, 18, 1 S 1:14 (???????? ????), Jer

never allow of the retraction of the tone.

7. On the numerous instances of passive forms in the imperfect, mostly treated as Hophal,

see § 53 u.

§ 48. Shortening and Lengthening of the Imperfect and Imperative. The Jussive and
Cohortative.

1. Certain modifications which take place in the form of the imperfect, and

express invariably, or nearly so, a distinct shade of meaning, serve to some extent as a
compensation for the want of special forms for the Tempora relativa and for certain
moods of the verb.

2. Along with the usual form of the imperfect, there exists also a lengthened form

of it (the cohortative), and a shortened form (the jussive).2 The former occurs (with
few exceptions) only in the 1st person, while the latter is mostly found in the 2nd and
3rd persons, and less frequently in the 1st person. The laws of the tone, however, and
of the formation of syllables in Hebrew, not infrequently precluded the indication of
the jussive by an actual shortening of the form; consequently it often—and, in the
imperfect forms with afformatives, always—coincides with the ordinary imperfect
(indicative) form.

In classical Arabic the difference is almost always evident. That language distinguishes,

besides the indicative y?qt?l?, (a) a subjunctive, y?qt?l?; (b) a jussive, y?qt?l; (c) a double
‘energetic’ mood of the impf., y?qt?l?nn? and y?qt?l?n, in pause y?qt?l?, the last form thus
corresponding to the Hebrew cohortative.

3. The characteristic of the cohortative form is an ? (? ??) affixed to the 1st pers.
sing. or plur., e.g. ????????? from ???????.1 It occurs in almost all conjugations and classes
of the strong and weak verb (except of course in the passives), and this final ? ?? has

2 2 The perfect has only one form, since it cannot be used, like the imperfect, to
express mood-relations (see § 106 p).
1 1 Probably this ? goes back to the syllable an, which in Arabic (see above, Rem. to
b) is used for the formation of the ‘energetic’ mood, and in Hebrew (see the footnote
to § 58 i) often stands before suffixes.

 I will observe, in Piel

the tone wherever the afformatives ? and ? ?? would have it. As before these endings, so
also before the ? ?? cohortative, the movable vowel of the last syllable of the verbal
form becomes Šeewâ, e.g. in Qal

the Keth??bh of these passages, compare the analogous cases ??????, &c., § 47 g.—On
the other hand, an unchangeable vowel in the final syllable is retained as tone-vowel
 I will praise. In pause (as before û and ??), the
before the
vowel which became Šewâ is restored as tone-vowel; thus for the cohortative

The change of

???   into the obtuse ? ?? seems to occur in 1 S 28:15, unless, with Nestle, we

are to assume a conflate reading, ??????????? and ??????????; and with the 3rd pers. Ps 20:4, in a
syllable sharpened by a following Dageš forte conjunct.; cf. similar cases of the change of ? ??
into the obtuse ? ?? in l and in §§ 73 d, 80 i, 90 i. In Ps 20:4, however,
—with suffix—is
probably intended. An ? ?? cohort. is also found with the 3rd pers. in Is 5:19 (twice); Ez 23:20,
and again in verse 16 according to the Qerê, but in both these cases without any effect on the
????????
meaning. Probably another instance occurs in Jb 11:17, although there
 might also, with
Qim?i, be regarded as 2nd masc. For the doubly irregular form
 Dt 33:16 (explained
????
by Olshausen and König as a scribal error, due to a confusion with ????? in verse 14), read
?????
. For ?????????? Jb 22:21 the noun ?????????? thine increase, might be meant, but the Masora
has evidently intended an imperfect with the ending ath, instead of ? ??, before the suffix, on
the analogy of the 3rd sing. fem. perfect, see § 59 a; on ?????? 1 S 25:34, see § 76 h.

?????????

The cohortative expresses the direction of the will to an action and thus denotes

especially self-encouragement (in the 1st plur. an exhortation to others at the same time), a
resolution or a wish, as an optative, &c., see § 108.

4. The general characteristic of the jussive form of the imperfect is rapidity of
pronunciation, combined with a tendency to retract the tone from the final syllable, in
order by that means to express the urgency of the command in the very first syllable.
This tendency has, in certain forms, even caused a material shortening of the
termination of the word, so that the expression of the command appears to be
concentrated on a single syllable. In other cases, however, the jussive is simply
marked by a shortening of the vowel of the second syllable, without its losing the
tone, and very frequently (see above, b) the nature of the form does not admit of any
alteration. It is not impossible, however, that even in such cases the jussive in the
living language was distinguished from the indicative by a change in the place of the
tone.

In the strong verb the jussive differs in form from the indicative only in Hiph??l

(juss. ???????, ind. ????????), and similarly in the weak verb, wherever the imperfect
indicative has ?? in the second syllable, e.g. from ? ???? impf. Hiph. ?? ????, juss. ? ????; from
???, ?????? and ?????; also in Qal of the verbs ??? and  ???
, as ?????, ind. ?????; ?????, ind. ??????; in
all conjugations of verbs ???, so that the rejection (apocope) of the ending ? ?? in Qal
and Hiph. gives rise to monosyllabic forms, with or without a helping vowel under the
?????? ; and in the Pi?l ?????
second radical, e.g. Qal ind.

?????? ; Hiph. ind. ???????, juss.

??????? , juss.

from the indic. ??????? (called apocopated imperfects). But almost all1 the plural forms of
the jussive coincide with those of the indicative, except that the jussive excludes the
fuller ending ??. Neither do the forms of the 2nd sing. fem., as
, ???????, &c.,
admit of any change in the jussive, nor any forms, whether singular or plural, to which
suffixes are attached, e.g.

 as ind. Jer 38:15, as jussive Jer 41:8.

The meaning of the jussive is similar to that of the cohortative, except that in the
jussive the command or wish is limited almost exclusively to the and or 3rd pers. On
special uses of the jussive, e.g. in hypothetical sentences (even in the 1st pers.), see §
109 h.

5. The imperative, in accordance with its other points of connexion with the
imperfect in form and meaning, admits of a similar lengthening (by ? ??, Arab. imper.
energicus, with the ending -?nn? or -?n, in pause -?) and shortening. Thus in Qal of
the strong verb, the lengthened form of ??? ?? guard is ????? ??2 (š?merâ, cf. ??????? q???el??, §
46 d); ?????, ??????? Jer 49:11; ??? ??, ????? ?? lie down; ??? ??, ????? ?? hear, in lesser pause
?? ??????
Dn 9:19; in Niphal ??????????? Gn 21:23. Cf., however, also ??????? sell, Gn 25:31,
notwithstanding the impf. ???????; ??????? Jb 33:5 (cf. ?????? Jer 46:3), but impf. ?????????;
???????? collect, Nu 11:16 (for ???? cf. § 63 l and the plural ??????), but 2nd masc. ?????;
??????? Ps 141:3. Barth (see above, § 47 i note) finds in these forms a trace of old
imperfects in i, cf. § 63 n. On the other hand, ??????? Ps 69:19 (also Imperat. ????? Lv 9:7,
&c.), but impf. ???????. Without ?, we have the form ???? go, Nu 23:13, Ju 19:13, 2 Ch
25:17. The form ????? in pause becomes
????????
Dt 33:23. But also without the pause we find

The shortened imperative is found only in verbs ???, e.g. in Pi?l ??? from ?????. The
shade of meaning conveyed by the imperatives with ? ?? is not always so perceptible as
in the cohortative forms of the imperfect, but the longer form is frequently emphatic,
e.g. ??? rise up,

 up! ??? give, ????? give up!

??????

Rem. The form ????? for ?????, best attested in Pr 24:14 (where it is taken by the Masora as
imperat., not as infin., ?????) is evidently due to the influence of the ? which follows it in close
connexion (so Strack, on the analogy of Jb 31:2); for other examples of this change of a to
Seghol, see above, under d, § 73 d, and § 80 i. On the other hand, it is doubtful whether ????? Ju
9:29 (from ?????) is intended for ?????, and not rather for the common form of the imperative
Pi?l ?????. In favour of the former explanation it may be urged that the imperative
?????) follows immediately after; in favour of the latter, that the ending ? ??, with imperatives of
verbs ???, is not found elsewhere, and also that here no guttural follows (as in Pr 24:14).

§ 49. The Perfect and Imperfect with W?w Consecutive.

1. The use of the two tense-forms, as is shown more fully in the Syntax (§§ 106,
107, cf. above, § 47, note on a), is by no means restricted to the expression of the past
or future. One of the most striking peculiarities in the Hebrew consecution of tenses1
is the phenomenon that, in representing a series of past events, only the first verb
stands in the perfect, and the narration is continued in the imperfect. Conversely, the
representation of a series of future events begins with the imperfect, and is continued
in the perfect. Thus in 2 K 20:1, In those days was Hezekiah sick unto death (perf.),
and Isaiah … came (imperf.) to him, and said (imperf.) to him, &c. On the other
hand, Is 7:17, the Lord shall bring (imperf.) upon thee … days, &c., 7:18, and it shall
come to pass (perf. ???????) in that day …

This progress in the sequence of time, is regularly indicated by a pregnant and
(called w?w consecutive1), which in itself is really only a variety of the ordinary w?w
copulative, but which sometimes (in the imperf.) appears with a different vocalization.
Further, the tenses connected by w?w consecutive sometimes undergo a change in the
tone and consequently are liable also to other variations.

2. The w?w consecutive of the imperfect is (a) pronounced with Patha? and a
Dageš forte in the next letter, as ????????? and he killed; before ? of the 1st pers. sing.
(according to § 22 c) with Qame?, as ?????????? and I killed. Exceptions are, ??????????? Ez
16:10 according to the Dikduke ha-?eamim, § 71; also
Qim?i; but in Ju 6:9 ?????????? should be read according to Baer, and ?????? in both places
in Ju 20:6. Dageš forte is always omitted in the preformative ??, in accordance with §
20 m.

 2 S 1:10 according to

???????????

???

(b) When a shortening of the imperfect form is possible (cf. § 48 g), it takes effect,
as a rule (but cf. § 51 n), after w?w consec., e.g. in Hiphil ????????? (§ 53 n). The tendency

1 1 The other Semitic languages do not exhibit this peculiarity, excepting the
Phoenician, the most closely related to Hebrew, and of course the Moabitish dialect of
the Mêša inscription, which is practically identical with Old Hebrew. It also appears
in the inscription of ??? of Ham?th (cf. Noöldeke, ZA. 1908, p. 379) where we find
??? ????? and I lifted up my hand, ?????? and he answered me, after a perfect of
narration.
1 1 This name best expresses the prevailing syntactical relation, for by w?w
consecutive an action is always represented as the direct, or at least temporal
consequence of a preceding action. Moreover, it is clear from the above examples,
that the w?w consecutive can only be thus used in immediate conjunction with the
verb. As soon as w?w, owing to an insertion (e.g. a negative), is separated from the
verb, the imperfect follows instead of the perfect consecutive, the perfect instead of
the imperfect consecutive. The fact that whole Books (Lev., Num., Josh., Jud., Sam., 2
Kings, Ezek., Ruth, Esth., Neh., 2 Chron.) begin with the imperfect consecutive, and
others (Exod., 1 Kings, Ezra) with w?w copulative, is taken as a sign of their close
connexion with the historical Books now or originally preceding them. Cf., on the
other hand, the independent beginning of Job and Daniel. It is a merely superficial
description to call the w?w consecutive by the old-fashioned name w?w conversive,
on the ground that it always converts the meaning of the respective tenses into its
opposite, i.e. according to the old view, the future into the preterite, and vice versa.

to retract the tone from the final syllable is even stronger after w?w consec. than in the
jussive. The throwing back of the tone on to the penultima (conditional upon its being
an open syllable with a long vowel, § 29 a), further involves the greatest possible
shortening of the vowel of the ultima, since the vowel then comes to stand in a
toneless closed syllable, e.g. ?????, juss.

(??????????, as in Ju 6:9, 1 S 2:28, and often, probably a sort of compensation for the lost
? ); Ju 6:10, 12:3, 2 S 22:24, Ps 3:6, 7:5, 90:10, 119:55, Jb 1:15 ff., 19:20, Ez 7:28,
8:25, 9:3, Neh 2:13, 5:7, 8, 13, 6:11, 13:7–11, 21 f., &c.—Sometimes, as in Ps 3:6,

This  ?·  is in meaning a strengthened w?w copulative, and resembles in pronunciation the
form which is retained in Arabic as the ordinary copula (w?).3 The close connexion of this w?
with the following consonant, caused the latter in Hebrew to take Dageš, especially as ? could
not have been retained in an open syllable. Cf. ?????, ?????,
??????  (for ?????), where the prepositions
?? and ??, and the particle ??  , are closely connected with ??? in the same way (§ 102 k).

The retraction of the tone also occurs in such combinations, as in

??????  (for

??????

 § 102 l).—

The identity of many consecutive forms with jussives of the same conjugation must not
mislead us into supposing an intimate relation between the moods. In the consecutive forms
the shortening of the vowel (and the retraction of the tone) seems rather to be occasioned
solely by the strengthening of the preformative syllable, while in the jussives the shortening
(and retraction) belongs to the character of the form.

3. The counterpart of w?w consecutive of the imperfect is w?w consecutive of the

perfect, by means of which perfects are placed as the sequels in the future to
preceding actions or events regarded as incomplete at the time of speaking, and
therefore in the imperfect, imperative, or even participle. This w?w is in form an
ordinary w?w copulative, and therefore shares its various vocalization (??, ?, ??, as 2 K

1 1 The plural forms in ?? also occur less frequently after w?w consecutive; cf.,
however, ?????????? Ju 8:1, 11:18, Am 6:3, Ez 44:8, Dt 4:11, 5:20. The 2nd fem. sing. in  ??
?? never occurs after w?w consecutive.

unreduced (cf. ?????, i.e. ???????, 4:9 Keth.; Qerê

I will go, Ju 1:3, where it is co-ordinated with another perfect consecutive, which
again is the consecutive to an imperative. See further on this usage in § 112.

As innumerable examples show, the Qame? of the first syllable is retained in the strong

perf. consec. Qal, as formerly before the tone, so now in the secondary tone, and therefore
necessarily takes Metheg. On the other hand, the ? of the second syllable in verbs middle ?
upon losing the tone necessarily becomes ?, e.g.  ???????????

 Ex 18:23.

?

The shifting forward of the tone after the w?w consecutive of the perfect is, however, not
consistently carried out. It is omitred—(a) always in the 1st pers. pl., e.g.
 Gn 34:16; (b)
regularly in Hiphil before the afformatives ? ?? and ?, see § 53 r; and (c) in many cases in verbs
??? and ???, almost always in the 1st sing. of ??? (Jer 29:14), and in ??? if the vowel of the
2nd syllable is ??, Ex 17:6, 26:4, 6, 7, 10 ff., Ju 6:26, &c., except In Qal (only Lv 24:5, before
?) and the 2nd sing. masc. of Hiphil-forms before ?, Nu 20:8, Dt 20:13, 1 S 15:3, 2 K 13:17;
similarly in Pi?l before ?, Ex 25:24, Jer 27:4. On the other hand the tone is generally moved
forward if the second syllable has ê (in ??? Gn 27:10 &c., in ??? Ex 40:4, Jer 33:6, Ez 32:7);
but cf. also

§ 50. The Participle.

1. Qal has both an active participle, called Pô?l from its form (?????), and a

passive, P?ûl (?????).1

P?ûl is generally regarded as a survival of a passive of Qal, which still exists throughout
in Arabic, but has been lost in Hebrew (see, however, § 52 e), just as in Aramaic the passives
of Pi?l and Hiph??l are lost, except in the participles. But instances of the form qu???l are better

1 1 The irregularity in the tone of these perfects manifestly results from following
conflicting theories, not that of Ben Asher alone.
1 1 The constr. st. ????? in the formula ???? ???, the word (properly the whispering) of
the Lord, &c., is always written defectively.

regarded as remnants of the passive participle Qal (see § 52 s), so that ????? must be
considered as an original verbal noun; cf. Barth, Nominalbildung, p. 173 ff.

2. In the intransitive verbs mid. e and mid. o, the form of the participle active of
Qal coincides in form with the 3rd sing. of the perfect, e.g. ? ???? sleeping, from ? ????; ?????
(only orthographically different from the perf. ?????) fearing; cf. the formation of the
participle in Niphal, § 51 a. On the other hand, the participle of verbs mid. a takes the
form ????? (so even from the transitive ??? ?? to hate, part. ????). The ô of these forms has
arisen through an obscuring of the â, and is therefore unchangeable, cf. § 9 q. The
form ????? (with a changeable Qame? in both syllables), which would correspond to the
forms ? ???? and ?????, is only in use as a noun, cf. § 84a f. The formation of the participle
in Pi?l, Hiph??l, and H??thpa?l follows a different method.

3. Participles form their feminine (???????? or

????????

) and their plural like other

nouns (§ 80 e, § 84a r, s, § 94).

Rem. 1. From the above it follows, that the ? of the form ? ???? is lengthened from ?, and
consequently changeable (e.g. fem. ??? ????); and that the ô of ????? on the other hand is obscured
from an unchangeable â.2 In Arabic the verbal adjective of the form q?t??l corresponds to the
form q???l, and the part. qât??l to qô??l. In both cases, therefore, the ? of the second syllable is
lengthened from ??, and is consequently changeable (e.g. ?????, plur. ?????????; ?????, constr. pl.
???????).

??????? Ps 16:5, instead of the form qô??l, is an anomaly; it is possible, however, that ???????
(incorrectly written fully) is intended (cf. ?????? 2 K 8:21), or even the imperfect Hiph??l of ??????.
The form ????? in Is 29:14, 38:5 appears to stand for ?????, but most probably the Masora here
(as certainly in ?????? Ec 1:18) intends the 3rd sing. imperf. Hiph., for which the better form
would be ?????; ?????? 1 Ch 27:30, being a proper name and a foreign word, need not be
considered.—????? (constr. state of ?????), with ? in the second syllable, occurs in Dt 32:28 (cf.
moreover, § 65 d). On

 Is 41:7 (for ?????), see § 29 f.

??????

2. A form like the pass. ptcp. P??l, but not to be confused with it, is sometimes found
from intransitive verbs, to denote an inherent quality, e.g. ???? faithful; ???? desperate, Jer
15:18, &c.; ?????? trustful, Is 26:3, Ps 112:7; ????? strong; ??? ?? drunken, Is 51:21; and even
from transitive verbs, ???? handling, Ct 3:8; ????? mindful, Ps 103:14; ?????? knowing, Is 53:3; cf.

VERBA DERIVATIVA, OR DERIVED CONJUGATIONS.

§ 51. Niphal.1

1. The essential characteristic of this conjugation consists in a prefix2 to the stem.
This exists in two forms: (a) the (probably original) prepositive n?, as in the Hebrew
perfect and participle, although in the strong verb the ? is always attenuated to ??: ???????

2 2 Cf. Vollers, ‘Das QaÆtil-partizipium, ’ in ZA. 1903, p. 312 ff.
1 1 Cf. A. Rieder, De linguae Hebr. verbis, quae vocantur derivata nifal et hitpael,
Gumbinnen (Progr. des Gymn.), 1884, a list of all the strong Niphal forms (81) and
Hithpa?l forms (36) in the Old Testament; and especially M. Lambert, ‘L’emploi du
Nifal en Hébreu, ’ REJ. 41, 196 ff.
2 2 See Philippi in ZDMG. 1886, p. 650, and Barth, ibid. 1894, p. 8 f.

for original n?-q???l, participle ???????, infinitive absolute sometimes ???????; (b) the
(later) proclitic in (as in all the forms of the corresponding Arabic conjugation VII.
inq?t?l?), found in the imperfect ??????? for yinq???l, in the imperative and infinitive
construct, with a secondary ? added, ??????? (for hinq???l), and in the infinitive absolute
??????? The inflexion of Niphal is perfectly analogous to that of Qal.

The features of Niphal are accordingly in the perfect and participle the prefixed Nûn, in
the imperative, infinitive, and imperfect, the Dageš in the first radical. These characteristics
hold good also for the weak verb. In the case of an initial guttural, which, according to § 22 b,
cannot take Dageš forte, the emission of the strengthening invariably causes the lengthening
of the preceding vowel (see § 63 h).

2. As regards its meaning, Niphal bears some resemblance to the Greek middle
voice, in being—(a) primarily reflexive of Qal, e.g. ??????? to thrust oneself (against),
??? ???? to take heed to oneself, ???????????, ??????? to hide oneself, ?????? to redeem
oneself; cf. also ???????? to answer for oneself. Equally characteristic of Niphal is its
frequent use to express emotions which react upon the mind; ????? to trouble oneself,
???????? to sigh (to bemoan oneself, cf. ?????????, lamentari, contristari); as well as to
express actions which the subject allows to happen to himself, or to have an effect
upon himself (Niphal tolerativum), e.g. ????? to search, to inquire, Niph. to allow
oneself to be inquired of, Is 65:1, Ez 14:3, &c.; so the Niph. of ????? to find, ????? to
warn, to correct, Jer 6:8, 31:18, &c.

(b) It expresses reciprocal or mutual action, e.g. ????? to speak, Niph. to speak to
one another; ??? ?? to judge, Niph. to go to law with one another; ????? to counsel, Niph.
to take counsel, cf. the middle and deponent verbs ??????????? (?????), µ???????
(???????), altercari, luctari (????? to strive with one another) proeliari.

(c) It has also, like Hithpa?l (§ 54 f) and the Greek middle, the meaning of the
active, with the addition of to oneself (sibi), for oneself, e.g. ?? ???? to ask (something)
for oneself (1 S 20:6, 28, Neh 13:6), cf. ?????µ?? ?? ?????, ????????? ??????? to put
out on (oneself) a tunic.

(d) In consequence of a looseness of thought at an early period of the language,
Niphal comes finally in many cases to represent the passive1 of Qal, e.g. ????? to bear,
Niph. to be born; ????? to bury, Niph. to be buried. In cases where Qal is intransitive in
meaning, or is not used, Niphal appears also as the passive of Pi?l and Hiph??l, e.g. ?????
to be in honour, Pi?l to honour, Niph. to be honoured (as well as Pual ?????); ????? Pi?l to
conceal, Hiph. to destroy, Niph. passive of either. In such cases Niphal may again
coincide in meaning with Qal (????? Qal and Niph. to be ill) and even take an
accusative.

1 1 Cf. Halfmann, Beitraäge zur Syntax der hebraäischen Sprache, I. Stuück,
Wittenb., 1888, 2. St. 1892 (Gymn.-Programm), statistics of the Niphal (Pual, Hophal,
and q??ûl) forms at different periods of the language, for the purpose of ascertaining
the meaning of Niph. and its relation to the passive; the selection of periods is,
however, very questionable from the standpoint of literary criticism.

Examples of denominatives are, ??????? to be born a male, Ex 34:19 (from ?????; but probably
??????? should here be read); ??????? cordatum fieri, Jb 11:12 (from ????? cor); doubtless also ??????? to
obtain children, Gn 16:2, 30:3.

The older grammarians were decidedly wrong in representing Niphal simply as the
passive of Qal; for Niphal has (as the frequent use of its imperat. shows), in no respect the
character of the other passives, and in Arabic a special conjugation (inq?t?l?) corresponds to
it with a passive of its own. Moreover, the forms mentioned in § 52 e point to a differently
formed passive of Qal.—The form ????????? Is 59:3, La 4:14, is not to be regarded as a passive of
Niphal, but with Koönig and Cheyne as a forma mixta, in the sense that the punctuators
intended to combine two optional readings, ????????, perf. Niph., and ???????, perf. Pual [cf. also
Wright, Compar. Gramm., p. 224]. Although the passive use of Niphal was introduced at an
early period, and became tolerably common, it is nevertheless quite secondary to the reflexive
use.

Rem. 1 The infin. absol. ??????? is connected in form with the perfect, to which it bears the

same relation as ????? to ????? in Qal, the ô in the second syllable being obscured from an
original â. Examples are, ??????? Gn 31:30; ??????? Ju 11:25; ??? ???? 1 S 20:6, 28, all in connexion
with the perfect.

Examples of the form ??????? (in connexion with imperfects) are, ??????? Jer 32:4; ??????? Lv
7:18; once ?????? Ez 14:3, where, perhaps, the subsequent ??????? has led to the substitution of ?
for ?.—Moreover, the form ??????? is not infrequently used also for the infin. absol.,2 e.g. Ex
22:3, Nu 15:31, Dt 4:26, 1 K 20:39. On the other hand, ????????? should simply be read for the
wholly abnormal ?????????, Ps 68:3 (commonly explained as being intended to correspond in
sound with the subsequent ??????? but probably a ‘forma mixta’, combining the readings ?????????
and ???????).

Elision of the ? after prepositions is required by the Masora in

 Pr. 24:17 (for ???????),
???????? Ez 26:15 and ???????? La 2:11; also in verbs ??? Ex 10:3 (????????); 34:24, Dt 31:11, Is 1:12
(????????); in verbs ??? Jb 33:30 (?????). It is, however, extremely doubtful whether the infin. Qal
of the Keth??bh is not rather intended in all these examples; it certainly is so in La 2:11, cf. Ps
61:3.

??????

?? ??

2. Instead of the ?ere in the ultima of the imperfect, Patha? often occurs in pause, e.g.
?????????? Gn 21:8; cf. Ex 31:17, 2 S 12:15 (with final ?); 17:23 (with ?); Jon 1:5 (with ?  ); see §
29 q. In the 2nd and 3rd plur. fem. Patha? predominates, e.g.
only in
 Ru 1:13, from ???, and hence, with loss of the doubling, for
?????????? Is 60:4.—With Nûn paragogicum (see § 47 m) in the 2nd and 3rd plur. masc. are
found, ??????????, ??????????, &c., in pause ??????????, ???????????, &c.; but Jb 19:24 (cf. 24:24) ???????????.

 Is 65:17; ?ere occurs
; cf. even
???????

3. When the imperfect, the infinitive (in ?), or the imperative is followed in close

connexion by a monosyllable, or by a word with the gone on the first syllable, the tone is, as a
rule (but cf. ???? ????????? Gn 32:25), shifted back from the ultima to the penultima, while the
ultima, which thus loses the tone, takes Seghôl instead of ?ere; e.g.
?? ???
??????
?
 (since ???? counts as one syllable) Gn
Gn 25:21; in the imperative, 13:9.—So always
24:6, &c., cf. 1 S 19:2; and even with Patha? in the ultima,
?????????

 Jb 18:4 (but cf.

 Ez 33:12;

?????????? ?

???? ???

?????

????

?????

2 2 But, like ???????, only in connexion with imperfects, except Jer 7:9. Barth is
therefore right in describing (Nominalbildung, p. 74) both forms as later analogous
formations (in addition to the original Semitic ???????), intended to assimilate the
infinitive to the imperfect which it strengthens.

???????? 2 S 21:14). Although in isolated cases (e.g. Gn 32:25, Ezr 8:23) the tone is not thrown
back, in spite of a tone-syllable following, the retraction has become usual in certain forms,
???????
even when the next word begins with a toneless syllable; especially after ? consec., e.g.
Gn 7:23;
 25:3; and always so in the imperative ???????? Ex
??????
23:21, Jb 36:21, and (before Metheg of the counter-tone) Dt 24:8, 2 K 6:9. On the avoidance
of pausal-forms in the imperative (Am 2:12 with Silluq, Zc 2:11 with Athna?), and imperfect
(Pr 24:4, &c.), see § 29 o, and note; on the other hand, always ???????, ???????, &c.

 Nu 21:1 and frequently,

????

????

????

??????

In the imperative, ????????, for ?????????, with the rejection of the initial ?, occurs in Is 43:9,

and in Joel 4:11 in pause
 (cf. ?????? Jer 50:5); but in these examples either the reading or
the explanation is doubtful. The 2nd sing. imperat. of ??? ???? is always (with ? ?? paragogicum)
??? ?????
?????
?

 swear to me, Gn 21:23, &c. (also ??? ??????????? Gn 47:31, 1 S 30:15).

??????

???

4. For the 1st sing. of the imperfect, the form ??????? is as frequent as ???????, e.g. ??????? I shall

be inquired of, Ez 14:3; ????????? I will swear, Gn 21:24; cf. 16:2, Nu 23:15, Ez 20:36, and so
always in the cohortative, e.g. ?????????? I will avenge me, Is 1:24; cf. 1 S 12:7, Ez 26:2, and in
the impf. Niph. of ??? (§ 69 t). The Babylonian punctuation admits only ?? under the
preformative of the 1st person.

§ 52. Pi(cid:31)?l and Pu(cid:31)al.

1. The characteristic of this conjugation consists in the strengthening of the
middle radical. From the simple stem qa?al (cf. § 43 b) the form ????? (cf. the Arabic
conj. II. q?tt?l?) would naturally follow as the perfect of the active (Pi(cid:31)?l). The
Patha? of the first syllable is, however, with one exception (see m), always attenuated
to ?? in the perfect. In the second syllable, ? has been retained in the majority of cases,
so that the conjugation should more correctly be called Pi(cid:31)al; but very frequently1
this ? also is attenuated to ??, which is then regularly lengthened to ?, under the
influence of the tone. Cf. in Aram. ?????; but in Biblical Aramaic almost always ?????.
On the three cases in which ? before a final ? or ? has passed into Seghôl, see below,
l.—Hence, for the 3rd sing. masc. perfect, there arise forms like ?????, ?????, ?????; ?????,
?????, &c.—Before afformatives beginning with a consonant, however, ? is always
retained, thus
qa??âl; constr. ?????), imperfect (???????), imperative (?????), and participle (???????) the
original ? of the first syllable reappears throughout. The vocal Šewâ of the
preformatives is weakened from a short vowel; cf. the Arabic imperfect y?q?tt??l,
participle m?q?tt??l.

, &c. In the infinitives (absol. ?????, obscured from

, ?????????,

?????????

?????

????

The passive (Pu(cid:31)al) is distinguished by the obscure vowel ?, or very rarely ?, in
the first syllable, and ? (in pause ?) always in the second. In Arabic, also, the passives
are formed throughout with ? in the first syllable. The inflexion of both these
conjugations is analogous to that of Qal.

Rem. 1. The preformative ??  , which in the remaining conjugations also is the prefix of the

participle, is probably connected with the interrogative or indefinite (cf. § 37) pronoun ???
quis? quicunque (fem. i.e. neuter, ???); cf. § 85 e.

1 1 So in all verbs which end in Nûn, and in almost all which end in Lamed (Olsh. p.
538). Barth is probably right in supposing (ZDMG. 1894, p. 1 ff.) that the vowels of
the strengthened perfects have been influenced by the imperfect.

2. The Dageš forte, which according to the above is characteristic of the whole of Pi(cid:31)?l
and Pu(cid:31)al, is often omitted (independently of verbs middle guttural, § 64 d) when the middle
radical has Šewâ under it (cf. § 20 m), e.g. ????? ?? for ????? ?? Ez 17:17;
 2 Ch 15:15 (but in
the imperative always ?????? 1 S 28:7, &c.), and so always in ?????? praise. The vocal character
of the Šewâ under the litera dagessanda is sometimes in such cases (according to § 10 h)
expressly emphasized by its taking the form of a ?a?eph, as in ???????? Gn 2:23, with ?? owing to
the influence of the preceding u, cf. ??????? for ??????, &c.; Gn 9:14, Ju 16:16. In the imperfect
and participle the Šewâ under the preformatives (?a?eph-Patha? under ? in the 1st sing.
imperfect) serves at the same time as a characteristic of both conjugations (Gn 26:14 f.).

??????

???

3. According to the convincing suggestion of Boöttcher2 (Ausfuührliches Lehrbuch, § 904

ff. and § 1022), many supposed perfects of Pu(cid:31)al are in reality passives of Qal. He reckons
as such all those perfects, of which the Pi??l (which ought to express the corresponding
active) is either not found at all, or only (as in the case of ?????) with a different meaning, and
which form their imperfect from another conjugation, generally Niph?al. Such perfects are the
qu??al form of the stems ??? (imperfect ???????? Is 1:20), ???, ???, ???, ???, ???, ???, ???, ???,
????. Barth (see below) adds to the list the apparent Pu?al-perfects of ???, ???, ???, ???, ???,
???, ???, ???, ???, and of verbs with middle ? (hence with ? of the first syllable lengthened to
?), ???, ??? Jb 3:3 [???, see § 67 m], ???, ???, ???, ???, ???, ???; also the infinitives absolute
?????? ??  Is 59:13. In these cases there is no need to assume any error on the part of the
punctuators; the sharpening of the second radical may have taken place in order to retain the
characteristic ? of the first syllable (cf. Arab. q?t??l? as passive of q?t?l?), and the a of the
second syllable is in accordance with the vocalization of all the other passives (see § 39 f). Cf.
§ 52 s and § 53 u.

??

2. The fundamental idea of Pi??l, to which all the various shades of meaning in
this conjugation may be referred, is to busy oneself eagerly with the action indicated
by the stem. This intensifying of the idea of the stem, which is outwardly expressed
by the strengthening of the second radical, appears in individual cases as—(a) a
strengthening and repetition of the action (cf. the intensive and iterative nouns with
the middle radical strengthened, § 84b),1 e.g. ????? to laugh, Pi??l to jest, to make sport
(to laugh repeatedly); ?? ?? to ask, Pi??l to beg; hence when an action has reference to
many, e.g. ????? to bury (a person) Gn 23:4, Pi??l to bury (many) 1 K 11:15, and often
so in Syr. and Arab. Other varieties of the intensive and iterative meaning are, e.g. ?????
to open, Pi??l to loose; ????? to count, Pi??l to recount: [cf. ?????, ??????, ??????, ?????, ?????,
?????; ??????, ????????].

The eager pursuit of an action may also consist in urging and causing others to do
the same. Hence Pi??l has also—(b) a causative sense (like Hiph???l), e.g. ????? to learn,
Pi??l to teach. It may often be turned by such phrases as to permit to, to declare or

2 2 As Mayer Lambert observes, the same view was already expressed by Ibn ?anâ?
(see above, § 3 d) in the Kit?b el-luma(cid:31), p. 161. Cf. especially Barth, ‘Das passive
Qal und seine Participien, ’ in the Festschrift zum Jubilaäum Hildesheimer (Berlin,
1890), p. 145 ff.
1 1 Analogous examples, in which the strengthening of a letter has likewise an
intensive force, are such German words as reichen, recken (Eng. to reach, to rack);
streichen (stringo), strecken: cf. Strich (a stroke), Strecke (a stretch); wacker from
wachen; others, in which it has the causative sense, are stechen, stecken; wachen
(watch), wecken (wake); ????? to bring to an end (cf. the stem ???? to end, in ?????,
?????); ?????? to beget, from the stem ???? to come into being (cf. ?????).

hold as (the declarative Pi??l), to help to, e.g. ????? to cause to live, ????? to declare
innocent, ????? to help in child-bearing.

(c) Denominatives (see § 38 b) are frequently formed in this conjugation, and
generally express a being occupied with the object expressed by the noun, either to
form or to make use of it, e.g. ????? to make a nest, to nest (from ???), ????? to throw dust,
to dust (from ?????), ????? to gather the clouds together (from ?????), ??? ?? to divide in three
parts, or to do a thing for the third time (from ?? ??); probably also ????? to speak, from
????? a word. Or again, the denominative may express taking away, injuring, &c., the
object denoted by the noun (privative Pi??l, cf. our to skin, to behead, to bone), e.g.
??? ??, from
the rear of an army, to attack it; ????? to ravish the heart; ?????? to remove the ashes
(
? ?? ), ????? to free from sin (?????), ????? to break any one’s bones (
sense, ????? from
words are clearly denominatives, although the noun from which they are derived is no
longer found, e.g. ????? to stone, to pelt with stones (also used in this sense in Qal), and
to remove stones (from a field), to clear away stones; cf. our to stone, used also in the
sense of taking out the stones from fruit.

?????? ); ????? to lop the boughs, Is 10:33 (from ?????? a bough). Some

 to root out, to extirpate, ????? prop. to injure the tail (?????), hence to rout

?????? ; cf., in the same

??????

???

The meaning of the passive (Pu?al) follows naturally from the above, e.g. ?????

Pi??l to seek, Pu?al to be sought.

In Pi??l the literal, concrete meaning of the verb has sometimes been retained, when Qal
has acquired a figurative sense, e.g. ?????, Pi??l to uncover, Qal to reveal, also to emigrate, i.e.
to make the land bare.

Also with an intransitive sense Pi??l occurs as an intensive form, but only in poetic
language, e.g. ??? in Pi??l to be broken in pieces, Jer 51:56; ????? to tremble, Is 51:13, Pr
28:14; ????? to be drunken, Is 34:5, 7; [????? to be few, Ec 12:3]; but in Is 48:8, 60:11 instead of
the Pi??l of ??? the Niph?al is certainly to be read, with Cheyne.

Rem. 1. The (more frequent) form of the perfect with Patha? in the second syllable

appears especially before Maqqeph (Ec 9:15, 12:9) and in the middle of sentences in
continuous discourse, but at the end of the sentence (in pause) the form with ?ere is more
common. Cf. ????? Is 49:21 with ????? Jos 4:14, Est 3:1; ????? Ez 33:5 with ????? Ec 9:15; ????? 2 K
8:16 with ????? Ps 129:4; but Qame? never appears in this pausal form. The 3rd sing. fem. in
; the 2nd
pause is always of the form
and 1st sing. and 1st plur. of course as
),
?????
????
. In the 3rd sing. perf. ????? to speak, ????? to pardon, and ????? to wash clothes (also ????? Gn
49:11) take Seghôl, but become in pause ?????, ????? (2 S 19:25); the pausal form of ????? does not
occur.

 Mi 1:7; the 3rd plur. always as

Patha? in the first syllable (as in Aramaic and Arabic) occurs only once, Gn 41:51,

he made me forget, to emphasize more clearly the play on the name ????????.

2. In the imperfect (and jussive Ju 16:25), infinitive, and imperative Pi??l (as also in
Hithpa??l) the ?ere in the final syllable, when followed by Maqqeph, is usually shortened into
Seghôl, e.g. ?????????? he seeks for himself, Is 40:20; ????????? sanctify unto me, Ex 13:2. Pausal-
forms with Seghôl instead of ?ere, as ??????? Dt 32:11, ??????? Ho 2:6 (cf. Ex 32:6 in the infinitive,
and Gn 21:9 in the participle), owe their origin to some particular school of Masoretes, and

are wrongly accepted by Baer; cf. the analogous cases in § 75 n and hh. If the final syllable of
the imperfect Pi??l has Patha? (before a guttural or ?), it remains even in pause; cf. § 29 s and
65 e. In the 1st sing. imperfect the e-sound occurs in two words for ?a?eph-Patha?, under the
preformative ?; ??????? Lv 26:33, Ez 5:12, 12:14 and
h).—Before the full plural ending ?? (see § 47 m) the ?ere is retained in pause, e.g.  ???????
58:2 (but Gn 32:20  ???????
???
before Zaqeph qa?on Dt 7:5. Instead of
13:18, in both cases before a sibilant and in pause. Also ????? Ps 55:10 occurs as the 2nd sing.
imperative (probably an intentional imitation of the sound of the preceding ?????) and ????? (for
qarrabh) Ez 37:17.

 Zc 7:14 (in accordance with § 23
 Ps
), cf. 2 K 6:19, Dt 12:3; so before Silluq Ps 58:3, Jb 21:11 and even
 are also found, e.g. Is 3:16,

, forms like

????????????

????????????

??????

??????

???

3. The infinite absolute of Pi??l has sometimes the special form ????? given in the

paradigm, e.g. ????? castigando, Ps 118:18; cf. Ex 21:19, 1 K 19:10 (from a verb ???); Ps 40:2
(from a verb ???); but much more frequently the form of the infinitive construct (?????) is used
instead. The latter has also, in exceptional cases, the form ????? (with ? attenuated to ?? as in the
perfect), e.g. in 1 Ch 8:8 ???? ??; perhaps also (if not a substantive) ????? Jer 44:21; and for the
sake of assonance even for infinitive absolute in 2 S 12:14 (
Dt 32:35 and ????? Jer 5:13 are better regarded as substantives, while ????? Ex 6:28, Nu 3:1, Dt
4:15 (in each case after ?????), Ho 1:2 (after ???????), in all of which places it is considered by
König (after Qim?i) to be infinitive construct, is really perfect of Pi??l.

). On the other hand, ??? ??

??? ?????

?????

The infinitive construct Pi??l, with the fem. ending (cf. § 45 d), occurs in ??????? Lv 26:18;

??????? Ps 147:1; with ? of the fem. before a suffix
form of the Aram. inf. Pa?il (???????), see § 84b e.

????????  Ez 16:52. On the verbal nouns after the

??

Instead of the abnormal ?????????? (so Baer, Is 62:9) as ptcp. Pi?el, read ?????? with ed. Mant.

and Ginsburg.

4. In Pu?al ? is sometimes found instead of ? in the initial syllable, e.g. ?????? dyed red, Ex
25:5, &c., Na 2:4, cf. 3:7 ????? ??; Ez 16:4, Ps 72:20, 80:11. According to Baer’s reading also in
???????? Ps 62:4, and so also Ben Ašer, but Ben Naphtali ????????. It is merely an orthographic
licence when ? is written fully, e.g. ????? Ju 18:29.

5. As infinitive absolute, of Pu?al we find ????? Gn 40:15.—No instance of the inf. constr.

occurs in the strong verb in Pu?al; from ??? with suffix ?????? Ps 132:1.

6. A few examples occur of the participle Pu?al without the preformative (??  ), e.g. ????? Ex

????

???????

 as Mil?êl can only be the perfect. The rejection of the ??   may be

3:2; ????? (for ???????) Ju 13:8; ????? 2 K 2:10; ??????? Is 54:11. These participles are distinguished
from the perfect (as in Niph?al) by the ? of the final syllable. For other examples, see Is 30:24,
Ec 9:12 (where ?? ??????, according to § 20 n, stands for ????? = ???????); but, according to the Masora,
not Ez 26:17, since
favoured by an initial ?  , as in Is 18:2, 7 (but also ?????????); Pr 25:19 (where, however, read
????????
); so also in the participle Pi??l ????? Ex 7:27, 9:2 (always after ???, but cf. also ?????????? Jer
13:10, where, however, ??????????? = ????????????? is to be read, with Brockelmann, Grundriss, p. 264
f.) and ????? Zp 1:14 (and Is 8:1, 3?). Notice, however, Barth’s suggestion (Nominalbildung, p.
273) that, as the active of forms like ????? only occurs in Qal, they are perfect participles of
former passives of Qal (see e), and in Jer 13:10, 23:32, perfect participles of Pi??l.—On ???????
Ez 45:2, see § 65 d.

§ 53. Hiph???l and Hoph?al.

1. The characteristic of the active (Hiph???l) is a prefixed ?? (on its origin see § 55 i)

?????

??????

, &c. After the attenuation of this ? to ??, it ought

in the perfect ?? (with the ? attenuated to ??, as in Pi??l), which forms a closed syllable
with the first consonant of the stem. The second syllable of the perfect had also
originally an ?; cf. the Arabic conj. IV. ’aqt?l?, and in Hebrew the return of the
Patha? in the 2nd and 1st pers.
by rule to have been lengthened to ? in the tone-syllable, as in Aramaic ??????, beside
??????? in Biblical Aramaic. Instead of this, however, it is always replaced in the strong
verb by ??, 1 ? ??, but sometimes written defectively ??; cf. § 9 g. Similarly in the
infinitive construct ????????, and in the imperfect and participle ???????? and ????????, which
are syncopated from ?????????? and ??????????; § 23 k. The corresponding Arabic forms
(juqt??l and muqt??l) point to an original ?? in the second syllable of these forms. In
Hebrew the regular lengthening of this ?? to ? appears in the strong verb at least in the
jussive and in the imperfect consecutive (see n), as also in the imperative of the 2nd
sing. masc. (see m); on
 cf. § 26 p. On the return of the original ? in
the second syllable of the Imperat., Jussive, &c, under the influence of a guttural, cf. §
65 f.

??????

In the passive (Hoph?al) the preformative is pronounced with an obscure vowel,
whilst the second syllable has ? (in pause ?), as its characteristic, thus:—Perf. ??????? or
???????, Imperf. ??????? (syncopated from ?????????) or ???????, Part. ??????? or ??????? (from ?????????);
but the infinitive absolute has the form ???????.

Thus the characteristics of both conjugations are the ? preformative in the perfect,

imperative, and infinitive; in the imperfect and participle Hiph???l, Patha? under the
preformatives, in the Hoph?al ? or ?.

2. The meaning of Hiph???l is primarily, and even more frequently than in Pi??l (§
52 g), causative of Qal, e.g. ????? to go forth, Hiph. to bring forth, to lead forth, to draw
forth; ????? to be holy, Hiph. to sanctify. Under the causative is also included (as in
Pi??l) the declarative sense, e.g. ???????? to pronounce just; ??? ?????? to make one an evil
doer (to pronounce guilty); cf. ???, in Hiph???l, Jb 9:20, to represent as perverse. If
Qal has already a transitive meaning, Hiph???l then takes two accusatives (see § 117
cc). In some verbs, Pi??l and Hiph???l occur side by side in the same sense, e.g. ????
periit, Pi??l and Hiph???l, perdidit; as a rule, however, only one of these two
conjugations is in use, or else they differ from one another in meaning, e.g. ?????
gravem esse, Pi??l to honour, Hiph???l to bring to honour, also to make heavy. Verbs
which are intransitive in Qal simply become transitive in Hiph???l, e.g. ????? to bow
oneself, Hiph. to bow, to bend.

Among the ideas expressed by the causative and transitive are included, moreover,

according to the Hebrew point of view (and that of the Semitic languages in general,
especially Arabic), a series of actions and ideas, which we have to express by periphrasis, in
order to understand their being represented by the Hiph???l-form. To these inwardly transitive
or intensive Hiph???ls belong: (a) Hiph???l stems which express the obtaining or receiving of a

1 1 This ?(cid:31) may have been transferred originally from the imperfects of verbs ???, as a
convenient means of distinction between the indicative and jussive, to the imperfect of
the strong verb and afterwards to the whole of Hiph??(cid:31)l; so Stade, Philippi,
Praetorius, ZAW. 1883, p. 52 f.

concrete or abstract quality. (In the following examples the Qal stems are given, for the sake
of brevity, with the addition of the meaning which—often together with other meanings—
belongs to the Hiph???l.) Thus ???, ???, ???, ??? to be bright, to shine (to give forth brightness);
opposed to ???? to become dark; ???, ???, ??? to be strong (to develop strength), ??? to be
weak; ???? to be long (to acquire length); ??? to be high; ??? to be in tumult, ??? to cry out, ???,
??? to make a noise, to exult; ??? to sprout (to put forth shoots), cf. ??? to bloom, ???, ??? to
overflow; ???, ???, ???, ??? to be silent (silentium facere, Pliny); ??? to be sweet; ??? to
have success; ??? to be low; ??? to become red, ??? to become white.

(b) Stems which express in Hiph???l the entering into a certain condition and, further, the

being in the same: ??? to become firm, to trust in; ??? to become stinking; ??? to become
boiling, to boil over; ??? to become ill; ??? to come to want; ??? to become hot; ??? to
become dry, to become ashamed; ??? to attain superiority; ??? to become familiar; ???, ??? to
become awake; ??? to become hard; ???,  ???  to become quiet (to keep quiet); ??? to be
astonished. The Hiph???l forms of some verbs of motion constitute a variety of this class: ??? to
draw near; ??? to come near; ??? to withdraw far off (all these three are besides used as
causatives); ??? to come before.

(c) Stems which express action in some particular direction: ??? to err; ??? to flatter (to

act smoothly); ??? to act well, to do good; ??? to act foolishly, ??? to act wisely; ??? to act
craftily; ??? to act submissively; ???, ??? to act wickedly, godlessly; ???, ??? to act corruptly,
abominably; ??? to act peacefully, to be at peace, to be submissive.

Further, there are in Hiph???l a considerable number of denominatives which express the
bringing out, the producing of a thing, and so are properly regarded as causatives,1 e.g. ??? to
set over the treasury, Neh 13:13 (unless ??????????? is to be read, as in Neh 7:2); ??? to bring forth
a firstborn; ??? to cause to rain; ??? to produce seed; ??? (Hiph???l ???????) to go to the right, cf.
?????? ???? to go to the left; ??? to get or to have hoofs; ??? to get or to have horns; ??? to produce
abortion; ??? to become snow-white; ??? to grow fat; ??? to put forth roots, &c.; so also
according to the ordinary acceptation
???
?????????
?
stinking or stench, with retention of the ? prosthetic, § 19 m (but see below, p).

 Is 19:6, they have become stinking, from ???????

Of a different kind are the denominatives from: ??? (scarcely to prick up the ears, but) to
 to move the tongue, to slander, and the German äugeln (to

act with the ears, to hear; cf.  ???
make eyes), füsseln, näseln, schwänzeln; ??? to sell corn; ??? to set out early (to lead the
back [of the camel, &c.]?); opposed to ?????????.

3. The meaning of Hoph?al is (a) primarily that of a passive of Hiph???l, e.g. ????? ????
proiecit, ???? ???? or ???? ???? proiectus est; (b) sometimes equivalent to a passive of Qal, as
????? to avenge, Hoph. to be avenged (but see below, u).

Rem. 1. The ?? of the 3rd sing. masc. perf. Hiph???l remains, without exception, in the 3rd

fem. (in the tone-syllable). That it was, however, only lengthened from a short vowel, and
consequently is changeable, is proved by the forms of the imperative and imperfect where ?
(or, under the influence of gutturals, ?) takes its place. In an open syllable the ?? is retained
almost throughout; only in very isolated instances has it been weakened to Šewâ (see n and o).

1 1 The same ideas are also paraphrased by the verb ? ???? (to make), e.g. to make fat,
for, to produce fat upon his body, Jb 15:27; to make fruit, to make branches, for, to
put forth, to yield, Jb 14:9, Ho 8:7, cf. the Lat. corpus, robur, sobolem, divitias facere,
and the Ital. far corpo, far forze, far frutto.

2. The infinitive absolute commonly has ?ere without Yodh, e.g. ??????? Ju 17:3; less
frequently it takes ? ??, e.g. ???? ???? Am 9:8; cf. Dt 15:14, Is 59:4, Jer 3:15, 23:32, 44:25, Jb
34:35, Ec 10:10. With ? instead of ? (probably a mere scribal error, not an Aramaism) we find
???? ??? Jer 25:3. Rare exceptions, where the form with ?ere stands for the infinitive construct,
are, e.g. Dt 32:8 (Sam; ??????????; read perhaps ?????????), Jer 44:19, 25, Pr 25:2, Jb 13:3 (?); on the
other hand, for ? ?????? Dt 26:12 (which looks like an infinitive Hiph???l with elision of the ?, for
?? ?????????) the right reading is simply ????????, since elsewhere the Pi??l alone occurs with the
meaning to tithe; for ? ?????? Neh 10:39 perhaps the inf. Qal (??????) was intended, as in 1 S 8:15,
17 (=to take the tithe). At the same time it is doubtful whether the present punctuation does
not arise from a conflation of two different readings, the Qal and the Pi??l.

Instead of the ordinary form of the infinitive construct ???????? the form ???????? sometimes
occurs, e.g. ???? ???? to destroy, Dt 7:24, 28:48; cf. Lv 14:46, Jos 11:14, Jer 50:34, 51:33 and
??????? for ??????? Lv 14:43 from ?????; scarcely, however, Lv 7:35 (see § 155 l), 2 S 22:1 (Ps
18:1), 1 K 11:16 (after ???), and in the passages so explained by König (i. 276) where ???? ????
appears after prepositions1; [cf. Driver on Dt 3:3, 4:15, 7:24, 28:55].

With ? in the second syllable there occurs ??????????? Ez 21:29 (cf. the substantival infin.
????????
 1 S 15:23).—In the Aram. manner ????? ?????? is found in Ez 24:26 (as a construct form)
for the infinitive Hiph???l (cf. the infinitive Hithpa?el, Dn 11:23). On the elision of the ? after
prefixes, see q.

3. In the imperative the ?? is retained throughout in the open syllable, according to i, and

?????

 Ps 118:25, as in ed. Mant., Jabl;, Baer, not

consequently also before suffixes (see § 61 g) and ? ?? paragogic, e.g.
??? ????
tone at the end only ?????????? ibid. v. 25b. On the other hand, in the 2nd sing. masc. the original ??
(cf. Arabic ’áqt??l) is lengthened to ?, e.g. ??? ???? make fat, and becomes Seeghôl before
Maqqeph, e.g. ??????????? Jb 22:21.—The form ???????? for ??????? appears anomalously a few times:
Ps 94:1, Is 43:8, Jer 17:18 (cf. § 69 v and § 72 y); elsewhere the Masora has preferred the
 is required by the Qerê for
punctuation ????????, e.g. 2 K 8:6; cf. Ps 142:5.—In La 5:1
????.

 as Ginsb. and Kittel; with the

4. In the imperfect Hiph???l the shorter form with ?ere prevails for the jussive in the 3rd
 make not great, Ob 12; ??????? let Him cut off!

masc. and fem. and 2nd masc. sing., e.g.
?????
Ps 12:4; even incorrectly ?????? Ex 19:3 and ?????? Ec 10:20; cf. also ???????? Ex 22:4, where the
jussive form is to be explained according to § 109 h, and ???????? Jb 39:26 before the principal
pause. Similarly, after ? consec., e.g. ????????? and He divided, Gn 1:4. On the other hand, ?? is
almost always retained in the 1st sing., e.g. ???? ?????? Am 2:9 (but generally without ?, as ?????????
Ez 39:23 f., &c.); cf. § 49 e and § 74 l, but also § 72 aa; in 1st plur. only in Neh 4:3; in the 3rd
sing. Ps 105:28. With ? in the principal pause ??????? Ru 2:14, and in the lesser pause, Gn 49:4;
before a sibilant (see § 29 q) ??????? Ju 6:19; in the lesser pause ??????? La 3:5. Before Maqqeph the
?ere becomes Seghôl, e.g. ????????????? Ju 19:4. In the plural again, and before suffixes, ?? remains
in the forms
 Ju 18:22.
The only exceptions, where the ?? is weakened to Šewâ, are ?????????? Jer 9:2; ?????????? 1 S 14:22,
31:2, 1 Ch 10:2; ????????? Jer 11:15; ?????????? Neh 13:13, if it is Hiph???l of ???, but probably ??????????
is to be read, as in 7:2; perhaps also ???????? Jb 19:3 (according to others, imperfect Qal). The
same weakening occurs also in the imperfect in 3rd and and masc. sing. before suffixes, 1 S
17:25, 1 K 20:33, Ps 65:10, and in Jb 9:20, unless the form be Pi??l=??? ??????????, since the Hiph???l
is not found elsewhere. It is hardly likely that in these isolated examples we have a trace of

, even in the jussive and after ? consecutive, e.g.

Robertson Smith in the Journ. of Philol., xvi. p. 72 f.

the ground-form, yaqt??l, or an Aramaism. More probably they are due partly to a
misunderstanding of the defective writing, which is found, by a purely orthographic licence,
in numerous other cases (even in 3rd sing.
 Is 44:28), and partly are intended, as formae
?? ????
mixtae, to combine the forms of Qal and Hiph???l. Instead of the firmly closed syllable, the
Masora requires in Gn 1:11 ? ???????, with euphonic Ga?ya (see § 16 h).

??

??????

5. In the participle,

 Ps 135:7 appears to be traceable to the ground-form, maqt?l; yet
the ?ere may also possibly be explained by the retraction of the tone. The Masora appears to
require the weakening of the vowel to Šewâ (see above, n) in ?????????? Zc 3:7 (probably,
however, ??????????? should be read), also in ?????????? Jer 29:8, ?????????? 2 Ch 28:23 (but as ?
precedes, and accordingly dittography may well have taken place, the participle Qal is
probably to be read in both places; the reading of the text is perhaps again intended to
combine Qal and Hiph???l, see above, n), and in the Qerê ?????????? 1 Ch 15:24 &c. (where the
Keth??bh ?????????????? is better).—The fem. is ordinarily pointed as

6. In the perfect there occur occasionally such forms as

????

???????

 1 S 25:7; cf. Gn 41:28, 2 K

17:11, Jer 29:1, Mi 6:3, Jb 16:7; with the original ? in the first syllable  ???????????
 Na 3:5.—In
???????????1 I have stained, Is 63:3, ? stands at the beginning instead of ?, cf. above, k, on ???? ???.
On the other hand,
 Is 19:6 (see above, g) is a mere error of the scribe, who had the
Aramaic form in mind and corrected it by prefixing ?.

???????????

7. In the imperfect and participle the characteristic ? is regularly elided after the
preformatives, thus ????????, ????????; but it is retained in the infinitive after prepositions, e.g.
??????????. The exceptions are in the imperfect, ??? ?????? He will save for ??? ???? 1 S 17:47, Ps 116:6
(in pause); ??????? He will praise for ????? Neh 11:17, Ps 28:7, 45:18 (cf. the proper name ???????
?????????
Jer 37:3, for which 38:1 ????? [and ??????? Ps 81:6); [?????????? (§ 70 d) Is 52:5,
Jb 13:9] and  ?????????

??????? or ?????????.

 Ez 46:22; in the infinitive (where, however, as in Niph?al, § 51 l, the

8. With regard to the tone it is to be observed that the afformatives ? and ? ?? in Hiph???l
have not the tone, even in the perfect with waw consecutive (except in Ex 26:33 before ?, Lv
15:29 before ?, to avoid a hiatus); but the plural ending ?? (see § 47 m) always has the tone,
???
e.g.  ???????

 Dt 1:17.

9. The passive (Hoph?al) has ? instead of Qame? ?a?uph in the first syllable (???????), in the
strong verb less frequently in the perfect and infinitive, but generally in the participle, through
the influence of the initial ?   (but cf. ??? ???? Pr 25:26); e.g. ??? ???? Ez 32:32 (beside ????? ???? 32:19);
???? ???? impf. ???? ????, part. ???? ???? 2 S 20:21 (beside ?????? ???? Is 14:19)

 Ez 16:4; in the partic.

???????????

?????  (perfect Pi??l) is to be read, and the ? is only an

indication of the change of the perfect into the imperfect, as also previously, by a
change of punctuation, ??????? and ????? (instead of  ???????
of past. Jewish exegesis applied these Edomoracles to the Roman (i.e. Christian)
empire. So G. Moore in Theol. Literaturzeitung, 1887, col. 292.

 and ?????) are made future instead

?

Hoph. without elision of the ?: ??????????? Ez 46:22; on the other hand, verbs ??? always have ?
(in a sharpened syllable): ?????, ????? (cf. § 9 n).

10. The infinitive absolute has in Hoph?al (as in Hiph???l) ?ere in the last syllable, e.g.
??????? and ???????? Ez 16:4; ????? Jos 9:24. An infinitive construct does not occur in the strong verb.

11. With regard to the imperative Hoph?al, see above, § 46 a, note.

12. According to Böttcher (Ausführliches Lehrbuch, § 906) and Barth (see above, § 52 e)
a number of supposed imperfects Hoph?al are, in fact, imperfects of the passive of Qal. As in
the case of the perfects passive of Qal (see above, § 52 e) the question is again of verbs of
which neither the corresponding causative (i.e. here the Hiph???l), nor the other tense of the
same conjugation (i.e. here the perfect Hoph?al) is found; so with ????? (for ???????, cf. yuqt?l? as
imperfect Qal in Arabic) and ?????, from ????? and ?????; ????? from ????? (cf. § 66 g); ???? Nu 22:6
from ????; ????? from ?????;  ?????
 Jb 19:23 from ???; ????? &c. from
19:12 from ???; ????? Lev 11:35 from ???; the verbs ???:
???; the verb ???: ????? from ???; the verbs ???:
?????? ???
??
&c., § 73 f. In point of fact it would be very strange, especially in the case of ????? and ?????, that
of these frequently used verbs, amongst all the forms of Hiph???l and Hoph?al, only the
imperfect Hoph?al should have been preserved. A passive of Qal is also indicated in the
Tellel-Amarna letters, according to Knudtzon, by a number of imperfect forms, which are
undoubtedly due to Canaanite influence, cf. Beitr. zur Assyriologie, iv. 410.

 Ho 10:14 (cf. Is 33:1) from ??? ??; Barth adds the verbs ???: ????? Ez

, ? ????, ? ???? from ????, ?? ?? and ?? ??. On

§ 54. Hithpa??l.

1. The Hithpa??l1 is connected with Pi??l, being formed by prefixing to the Pi??l-
stem (qa???l, qa??al) the syllable ???? (Western Aramaic ????, but in Biblical Aramaic ????;
Syr. ’et2). Like the preformative

 of Niph?al, ???? has also a reflexive force.

)????  )?

2. The ? of the prefix in this conjugation, as also in Hothpa?al (see h), Hithpô?l,
Hithpa?l?l and Hithpalpel (§ 55), under certain circumstances, suffers the following
changes:

(a) When the stem begins with one of the harder sibilants ?, ?  , or ?, the ? and the
sibilant change places (cf. on this metathesis, § 19 n), and at the same time the ? after
a ?   becomes the corresponding emphatic ?: thus ????? ???? to take heed to oneself, for
??? ??????; ????????? to become burdensome, for ?????????; ????????? to justify oneself, from ?????.
??????????
The only exception is in Jer 49:3,
successive t-sounds.

, to avoid the cacophony of three

??????

(b) When the stem begins with a d- or t-sound (?, ?, ?), the ? of the preformative is

assimilated to it (§ 19 d), e.g. ??????? speaking, conversing; ??????? to be crushed, ??????? to
purify oneself, ??????? to defile oneself, ??????? to act uprightly. (An exception occurs in Ju
19:22.) The assimilation of the ? occurs also with ?  and ?  , e.g. ??????? to prophesy, as
well as ????????? (cf. Nu 24:7, Ez 5:13, Dn 11:14); ???????? Nu 21:27 (cf. Is 54:14, Ps 59:5);
??????? Pr 26:26; with ? Ec 7:16 with ? Is 33:10.

1 1 A. Stein, Der Stamm des Hithpael im Hebr. pt. 1, Schwerin, 1893, gives
alphabetical statistics of the 1151 forms.
2 2 So also in Hebrew ????????? 2 Ch 20:35; cf. Ps 76:6 (?????? ????).

Rem. Metathesis would likewise be expected, as in the cases under b, when ? and ? come
together, as well as a change of ? to ?. Instead of this, in the only instance of the kind (?????? Is
1:16) the ? is assimilated to the ?, —unless indeed

, imperative Niph?al of ???, is intended.

???????

3. As in form, so also in meaning, Hithpa??l is primarily (a) reflexive of Pi?l, e.g.

???????? to gird oneself, ????????? to sanctify oneself. Although in these examples the
intensive meaning is not distinctly marked, it is so in other cases, e.g. ????????? to how
oneself revengeful (Niph. simply to take revenge), and in the numerous instances
where the Hithpa??l expresses to make oneself that which is predicated by the stem, to
conduct oneself as such, to show oneself, to imagine oneself, to affect to be of a
certain character. E.g. ????????? to make oneself great, to act proudly; ????????? to show
oneself wise, crafty; ????????? to pretend to be ill; ?????????? to make, i.e. to feign oneself
rich; ????? ???? Nu 16:13, to make oneself a prince; ????????? 1 S 18:10, to act in an excited
manner like a prophet, to rave. The meaning of Hithpa??l sometimes coincides with
that of Qal, both forms being in use together, e.g. ???? to mourn, in Qal only in poetic
style, in Hithpa??l in prose. On the accusative after Hithpa??l (regarded as a transitive
verb), see § 117 w.

(b) It expresses reciprocal action, like Niph?al, § 51 d, e.g. ???????? to look upon one

another, Gn 42:1; cf. Ps 41:8; —but

(c) It moro often indicates an action less directly affecting the subject, and
describes it as performed with regard to or for oneself, in one’s own special interest
(cf. Niph?al, § 51 e). Hithpa??l in such cases readily takes an accusative, e.g. ????????? Ex
32:3 and ????????? Ex 33:6 to tear off from oneself; ?????????? exuit sibi (vestem), ?????????
solvit sibi (vincula);
accusative, ?????????? to walk about for oneself (ambulare); ????????? sibi intercedere (see
Delitzsch on Is 1:15); ????????? to draw a line for oneself, Job 13:27; on Is 14:2, see § 57,
note.

?????  Jos 9:12, to take (something) as one’s provision; without an

????

(d) Only seldom is it passive, e.g. ?????????? ???? Pr 31:30 she shall be praised; ????? ????
to be forgotten, Ec 8:10, where the reflexive sense (to bring oneself into oblivion) has
altogether disappeared. Cf. Niph?al, § 51 f.

The passive form Hothpa?al is found only in the few following examples: ??????? to be

defiled, Dt 24:4; infinitive ??????? to be washed, Lv 13:55, 56;
treated as if it were the afformative of the fem. plur.) it is made fat, Is 34:6. On ???????????, see l.

???????? ??  (for ??? ????????, the ??? being

Denominatives with a reflexive meaning are ????????? to embrace Judaism, from

???????
)
Judah; ????????? to provision oneself for a journey, from ?????? provision for a journey (see § 72
m).

?????

 (

Rem. 1. As in Pi??l, so in Hithpa??l, the perfect very frequently (in stems ending in ?, ?, ?  ,

?) has retained the original Patha? in the final syllable (while in the ordinary form it is
attenuated, as in Pi??l, to ?? and then lengthened to ?), e.g. ???????? Dt 4:21, &c.; cf. 2 Ch 13:7,
15:8; with ?? consecutive Is 8:21; so also in the imperfect and imperative, e.g. ????????? Ec 7:16;
cf. Dt 9:8, 18, 1 S 3:10, 2 S 10:12, 1 K 11:9, Is 55:2, 58:14, 64:11, Ps 55:2; ????????? 1 K 20:22,
Ps 37:4, Est 5:10; ??????????? 1 S 13:12.—In Lv 11:44, 20:7 and Ez 38:23, ?? takes the place of ?
in the final syllable of the stem before ? (cf. § 44 d), and in the last passage before ?. In the
perfect, imperfect (with the exception of Ec 7:16), and imperative of Hithpa??l (as well as of
Hithpô??l, Hithpa?l?l, Hithpalp?l, § 55) the original ? always returns in pause as Qame?, e.g.

 Ps 93:1; ???????? Ez 7:27; ?????????? Jb 18:8; ??????????? 38:30;

?????????
?
74 b.—The ? also appears before the fuller ending ?? in the plural of the imperfect (cf. § 47 m)
in Ps 12:9, Jb 96, 16:10.—Like the Pi(cid:31)?l
 (§ 52 n), forms occur in Hithpa(cid:31)?l like
 Zc 6:7; cf. Am 8:13, and so in Hithpo(cid:31)?l, Jer 49:3, Am 9:13; with ? only in La
??????
4:1.—In the Aramaic manner an infinitive Hithpa(cid:31)?l ??????????? occurs in Dn 11:23 (cf. the
Hiph(cid:31)??l inf. ????? ???? in Ez 24:26).

??

?

2. As instances of the reflexive ????????? (connected with Pi(cid:31)?l) a few reflexive forms of the

verb ????? (to examine) are also probably to be reckoned. Instead of a Patha? in a sharpened
syllable after the first radical, these take Qame? in an open syllable, e.g. ??????????? Ju 20:15, 17,
imperfect ????????? 20:15, 21:9. The corresponding passive form ??????????? also occurs four times,
Nu 1:47, 2:33, 26:62, 1 K 20:27. According to others, these forms are rather reflexives of Qal,
in the sense of to present oneself for review, to be reviewed, like the Aramaic Ithpe(cid:31)?l
(Western Aramaic ?????????, Syr. ?????????) and the Ethiopic taqatela, Arab. iqtatala, the last with
the t always placed after the first radical (cf. above, b); but they are more correctly explained,
with König, as Hithpa(cid:31)?l forms, the doubling of the ? being abnormally omitted.—Such a
reflexive of Qal, with the ? transposed, occurs in ????? (on the analogy of O.T. Hebrew to be
pronounced ?????????) in the inscription of the Moabite king Mêša(cid:31), with the meaning of the
O.T. Niph(cid:31)al ??????? to fight, to wage war: see the inscription, lines 11, 15, 19, and 32; in the
first two places in the imperfect with w?w consecutive ????????????; in line 19 in the infinitive with
suffix, ??? ?????????????? in his fighting against me.

§ 55. Less Common Conjugations.

Of the less common conjugations (§ 39 g) some may be classed with Pi(cid:31)?l, others

with Hiph(cid:31)??l. To the former belong those which arise from the lengthening of the
vowel or the repetition of one or even two radicals, in fact, from an internal
modification or development of the stem; to the latter belong those which are formed
by prefixing a consonant, like the ? of Hiph(cid:31)??l. Amongst the conjugations analogous
to Pi(cid:31)?l are included the passive forms distinguished by their vowels, as well as the
reflexives with the prefix ????, on the analogy of Hithpa(cid:31)?l.

The following conjugations are related to Pi(cid:31)?l, as regards their inflexion and

partly in their meaning:

1. Pô(cid:31)?l ?????, passive Pô(cid:31)al ?????, reflexive Hithpô(cid:31)?l ?????????, corresponding to the

Arabic conj. III. qât?l?, pass. qût?l?, and conj. VI. reflexive t?qât?l?; imperfect ???????,
participle ???????, imperfect passive ??????? &c. Hence it appears that in Hebrew the ô of the first
syllable is in all the forms obscured from â, while the passive form is distinguished simply by
the a-sound in the second syllable. In the strong verb these conjugations are rather rare.
Examples: participle ?????????? mine adversary, who would contend with me, Jb 9:15; ??? ???????
(denominative from ????? the tongue) slandering (as if intent on injuring with the tongue) Ps
101:5 Keth. (The Qeré requires ??? ?????? mel?šn?? as Na 1:3 ????????);
????  they have poured out, Ps
77:18 (if not rather Pu(cid:31)al);
 should be read);
?????
????
?
??????? Ho 13:3; ????? to take root, passive ?????, denominative from
root out); in Hithpô(cid:31)?l
????????
?????? and ?????????.

?????

???????

????

???

Po(cid:31)el proper (as distinguished from the corresponding conjugations of verbs ??? § 67 l

and ??? § 72 m, which take the place of the ordinary causative Pi(cid:31)?l) expresses an aim or

endeavour to perform the action, especially with hostile intent, and is hence called, by Ewald,
the stem expressing aim (Zielstamm), endeavour (Suche-stamm) or attack (Angriffs-stamm);
cf. the examples given above from Jb 9:15, Ps 101:5, and ????? 1 S 18:9 Qerê (probably for
???????, cf. § 52 s; § 55 f: seeking to cast an evil eye).

With ????? is connected the formation of quadriliterals by the insertion of a consonant

between the first and second radicals (§ 30 p, § 56).

2. Pa(cid:31)l?l, generally with the ? attenuated to ?=Pi(cid:31)l?l1 (Pi(cid:31)lal), ??????? and ???????; the ? in

the final syllable also arises from ?, and this again from ?; passive Pu(cid:31)lal ???????, reflexive
Hithpa(cid:31)l?l ???????????, like the Arabic conjugations IX. iqt?ll? and XI. iqtâll?, the former used of
permanent, the latter of accidental or changing conditions, e.g. of colours; cf. ?????? ?? to be at
rest, ???????? to be green, passive ??????? to be withered, all of them found only in the perfect and
with no corresponding Qal form. (For the barbarous form
; for
??????? Ez 28:23, which has manifestly arisen only from confusion with the following ???, read
?????). These forms are more common in verbs ???, where they take the place of Pi(cid:31)?l and
Hithpa(cid:31)?l (§ 72 m). Cf. also § 75 kk.

3. Pe(cid:31)al(cid:31)al:  ????????

 with repetition of the last two radicals, used of movements repeated
in quick succession; e.g. ????????? to go about quickly, to palpitate (of the heart) Ps 38:11, from
????? to go about; passive ????????? to be in a ferment, to be heated, to be red, Jb 16:16, La 1:20,
2:11. Probably this is also the explanation of ??????? (denom. from ?????????? a trumpet, but only
in the participle, 1 Ch 15:24 &c. Keth.) for ?????????, by absorption of the first ?, lengthening of
? in the open syllable, and subsequent obscuring of ? to ô. On the other hand, for the
meaningless  ??? ??????
??????????) read ??????, and for the equally meaningless
. In both these
cases a scribal error (dittography) has been perpetuated by the punctuation, which did not
venture to alter the Keth??bh. On the employment of Pe(cid:31)al(cid:31)al in the formation of nouns, cf. §
84b n. Closely related to this form is—

 Ho 4:18 (which could only be referred to this conjugation if it stood for

4. Pilp?l (pass. P?lpal), with a strengthening of the two essential radicals in stems ???,
???, and ???, e.g. ??????? to roll, from ???=?????; reflexive ??????????? to roll oneself down; ??????? from ???,
passive ???????; cf. also ?????? (so Baer and Ginsb. after Qim?i; others ??????) Is 14:23, and with ?
in both syllables owing to the influence of ?, ??????? from ??? Nu 24:17 (cf. however, in the
parallel passage, Jer 48:45 ???????) and Is 22:5, in the participle; ? ???? ?? Is 17:11 to hedge in, acc.
to others make to grow. Probably to this form also belongs ??????????, the emended reading of Jb
39:30 instead of the impossible ????????; also ??????? Is 27:8, if that form is to be referred to an
infinitive ???????; perhaps also ???? ?? Ez 39:2 for ????. This form also commonly expresses
rapidly repeated movement, which all languages incline to indicate by a repetition of the
sound,1 e.g. ??????? to chirp; cf. in the Lexicon the nouns derived from ?????, ???, and ?????.

As Hithpalpel we find ??? ?????? ???? Na 2:5; ????????????? Est 4:4; ????????????? Dn 8:7, 11:11. Of the
same form is ??????? Is 38:15, if contracted from ??????????? or ?????? from the root ?? or ??), and
also ???????????? tarry ye, Is 29:9 (but read probably ????????),  ????????????
?
is to be derived from ?????, and not Hithpa(cid:31)el from ???????.

1 1 Cf. Lat. tinnio, tintinno, our tick-tack, ding-dong, and the German wirrwarr,
klingklang. The repetition of the radical in verbs ??? also produces this effect; as in
????? to lick, ????? to pound, ????? to trip along. The same thing is expressed also by
diminutive forms, as in Latin by the termination -illo, e.g. cantillo, in German by -eln,
-ern, e.g. flimmern, trillern, tröpfeln, to trickle.

Only examples more or less doubtful can be adduced of—

??????? to interpret, whence also in Hebrew the passive participle ????????? Ezr 4:7.

6. Šaph(cid:31)?l: ????? ??, frequent in Syriac, e.g. ????? ?? from ??? to flame; whence in Hebrew

 flame. Perhaps of the same form is ????? ?? a snail (unless it be from the stem ???), and

???? ??????
????????? ?? hollow strakes, cf. § 85, No. 50. This conjugation is perhaps the original of Hiph(cid:31)??l,
in which case the ?, by a phonetic change which may be exemplified elsewhere, is weakened
from a sibilant.

Forms of which only isolated examples occur are:—

7. ???????, passive ???????; as ????????? peeled off, like scales, Ex 16:14, from ?????, ? ???? to peel, to

scale.

8. ???????, in ???????? a rain-storm, from ?????.

9. ????????? (regularly in Mishnic Hebrew3) a form compounded of Niph(cid:31)al and Hithpa(cid:31)?l;
 that they may be taught, Ez 23:48; ??????? probably an error for ????????? to be

????

as ?????????? for
forgiven, Dt 21:8. On ?????? ???? Pr 27:15, see § 75 x.

§ 56. Quadriliterals.

On the origin of these altogether secondary formations cf. § 30 p. While

quadriliteral nouns are tolerably numerous, only the following examples of the verb
occur:

????

??????????

(a) On the analogy of Pi(cid:31)?l: ???????, imperfect

 he doth ravage it, Ps 80:14 from
?????, cf. ?????. Passive ???????? to grow fresh again, Jb 33:25. Participle ????????? girt, clothed (cf.
Aramaic ????? to bind), 1 Ch 15:27. It is usual also to include among the quadriliterals ? ?????? Jb
26:9, as a perfect of Aramaic form with Patha? not attenuated. It is more correctly, however,
regarded, with Delitzsch, as the infinitive absolute of a Pi(cid:31)lel formation, from ????? to spread
out, with euphonic change of the first ? to ?, and the second to ?. Moreover, the reading ? ??????
also is very well attested, and is adopted by Beer in the text of Job; cf. the Rem. on p. 48 of
his edition.

(b) On the analogy of Hiph(cid:31)??l: ?????? ????, by syncope ????? ???? and ???? ???? to turn to the left

STRONG VERB WITH PRONOMINAL SUFFIXES.1

2 2 The existence of a Taph(cid:31)?l is contested on good grounds by Barth,
Nominalbildung, p. 279.
3 3 [See Segal, Mišnaic Hebrew, Oxf. 1909, p. 30 ff.]

§ 57.

The accusative of the personal pronoun, depending on an active verb,2 may be
expressed (1) by a separate word, ??? the accusative sign (before a suffix ???, ???) with
the pronominal suffix, e.g. ???? ????? he has killed him; or (2) by a mere suffix,
or ?????? he has killed him. The latter is the usual method (§ 33), and we are here
concerned with it alone.3 Neither of these methods, however, is employed when the
accusative of the pronoun is reflexive. In that case a reflexive verb is used, viz.
Niph(cid:31)al or Hithpa(cid:31)?l (§§ 51 and 54), e.g. ????????? he sanctified himself, not ??????,
which could only mean he sanctified him.4

?????????

Two points must be specially considered here: the form of the suffix itself (§ 58),

and the form which the verb takes when suffixes are added to it (§§ 59–61).

§ 58. The Pronominal Suffixes of the Verb.

Cf. the statistics collected by H. Petri, Das Verbum mit Suffixen im Hebr., part ii, in the
?????? ??????, Leipzig, 1890. W. Diehl, Das Pronomen pers. suff. … des Hebr., Giessen,
1895. J. Barth, ‘Beitraäge zur Suffixlehre des Nordsem., ’ AJSL. xvii (1901), p. 205 f.

1 1 This subject of the verbal suffixes is treated here in connexion with the strong
verb, in order that both the forms of the suffixes and the general laws which regulate
their union with verbal forms may be clearly seen. The rules which relate to the union
of the suffixes with weak verbs will be given under the several classes of those verbs.
2 2 An accusative suffix occurs with Niph(cid:31)al in Ps 109:3 (since ??????? is used in the
sense of to attack), and according to some, in Is 44:21; with Hithpa(cid:31)?l Is 14:2 (?????????
to appropriate somebody to oneself as a possession); cf. above, § 54 f, and § 117 w.
3 3 On the cases where ??? is necessary, see § 117 e.
4 4 The exceptions in Jer 7:19, Ez 34:2, 8, 10 are only apparent. In all these instances
the sharp antithesis between ????? (themselves) and another object could only be
expressed by retaining the same verb; also in Ex 5:19 ????? after an active verb serves
to emphasize the idea of themselves.

2. That these suffixes are connected with the corresponding forms of the personal

pronoun (§ 32) is for the most part self-evident, and only a few of them require
elucidation.

The suffixes ???, ??, ??, ?? (and ??, when a long vowel in an open syllable precedes)
never have the tone, which always rests on the preceding syllable; on the other hand,
??? and ??? always take the tone.

In the 3rd pers. masc.

??

???

, by contraction of a and u after the rejection of the

weak ?, frequently gives rise to ô (§ 23 k), ordinarily written ?, much less frequently
?? (see § 7 c). In the feminine, the suffix ?? should be pronounced with a preceding a
(cf. below, f, note), as
, however, it
was simply pronounced ? ??, with the rejection of the final vowel, and with Mappiq,
since the ? is consonantal; but the weakening to ? ?? is also found, see below, g.

, on the analogy of ?hû; instead of

?????

 or

3. The variety of the suffix-forms is occasioned chiefly by the fact that they are
modified differently according to the form and tense of the verb to which they are
attached. For almost every suffix three forms may be distinguished:

(a) One beginning with a consonant, as

 ?)???(
,
??
??
These are attached to verbal forms which end with a vowel, e.g.
???
????????
;
???????
which by absorption of the ? we also get ??????????, pronounced qe?alt??u; cf. § 8 m.

, ? (only after ??),

(b) A second and third with what are called connecting vowels1 (

???  ), used
with verbal forms ending with a consonant (for exceptions, see § 59 g and § 60 e).

???
???

???

,

1 1 According to Diehl (see above), p. 61, ??? occurs only once with the perfect (see §
59 e), 7 times with the imperfect, but never in pre-exilic passages, whereas the accus.
??????? occurs 40 times in Jer. and 36 times in Ezek.—??? occurs only once as a verbal
suffix (Dt 32:26, unless, with Kahan, Infinitive u. Participien, p. 13, ????????? from ????
is to be read), while the forms ??? (2nd f. pl.) and ? ?? and ??? (3rd f. pl.), added by Qim?i,
never occur.
1 1 We have kept the term connecting vowel, although it is rather a superficial
description, and moreover these vowels are of various origin. The connective a is
most probably the remains of the old verbal termination, like the i in the 2nd pers.
. Observe e.g. the Hebrew form qe??l-ani in connexion with the
fem. sing.
Arabic qatala-ni, contrasted with Hebrew qe??lat-ni and Arabic qatalat-ni. König
accordingly prefers the expression ‘vocalic ending of the stem’, instead of ‘connecting
syllable’. The connective ?, aŒ¬, as Prätorius (ZDMG. 55, 267 ff.) and Barth (ibid. p.
205 f.) show by reference to the Syriac connective ai in the imperf. of the strong verb,
is originally due to the analogy of verbs ??? (??????? = ???????? from me?ain?(cid:31)), in which the
final ê was used as a connecting vowel first of the imperat., then of the impf. (besides
many forms with a, § 60 d), and of the infin. and participle.

????????(cid:31)???

??????????

?????????

, ??????? (on

This connecting vowel is a with the forms of the perfect, e.g.
????????, the ordinary form of the 3rd masc. perf. with the 2nd fem. suffix, cf. below, g);
and e (less frequently a) with the forms of the imperfect and imperative, e.g.
,
????????
???????; also with the infinitive and participles, when these do not take noun-suffixes (cf.
§ 61 a and h). The form ? also belongs to the suffixes of the perfect, since it has arisen
from
?ewâ, which has arisen from an original short vowel, thus ?? ??, ??? ??, e.g. ?????????
(qe??lekh?), or when the final consonant of the verb is a guttural, ?? ??, e.g. ??????? ??. In
pause, the original short vowel (?) reappears as Seghôl with the tone
g). On the appending of suffixes to the final ?? of the imperfect (§ 47 m), see § 60 e.

 (cf., however, § 60 d). With ??, ???, the connecting sound is only a vocal

83:12]. On the age of these forms, see § 91 l 3; on ? ?? and ? ?? as suffixes of the 3rd fem. plur.

only an error for ???? ??????.

2. From a comparison of these verbal suffixes with the noun-suffixes (§ 91) we find that
(a) there is a greater variety of forms amongst the verbal than amongst the noun-suffixes, the
forms and relations of the verb itself being more various;—(b) the verbal suffix, where it
differs from that of the noun, is longer; cf. e.g.
 (me) with ? ?? (my). The reason is
???
that the pronominal object is less closely connected with the verb than the possessive pronoun
(the genitive) is with the noun; consequently the former can also be expressed by a separate
word (?? in ?????, &c.).

4. A verbal form with a suffix gains additional strength, and sometimes intentional
emphasis, when, instead of the mere connecting vowel, a special connecting-syllable2
(?n)3 is inserted between the suffix and the verbal stem. Since, however, this syllable

1 1 Thus in Ps 2 ??? occurs five times [four times attached to a noun or preposition, §§
91 f, 103 c], and ? ?? only twice.
2 2 It is, however, a question whether, instead of a connecting syllable, we should not
assume a special verbal form, analogous to the Arabic energetic mood (see l, at the
end) and probably also appearing in the Hebrew cohortative (see the footnote on § 48
c).—As M. Lambert has shown in REJ. 1903, p. 178 ff. (‘De l’emploi des suffixes
pronominaux …’), the suffixes of the 3rd pers. with the impf. without waw in prose
are
2nd and 3rd pers. always
.
always
3 3 According to Barth ‘n-haltige Suffixe’ in Sprachwiss. Untersuchungen, Lpz. 1907,
p. 1 ff., the connecting element, as in Aramaic, was originally in, which in Hebrew
became en in a closed tone-syllable.

bearing Seghôl. This is called the Nûn energicum4 (less suitably demonstrativum or
epentheticum), and occurs principally (see, however, Dt 32:10 bis) in pausal forms of
 Jer 22:24;
the imperfect, e.g. ?????????????? he will bless him (Ps. 72:15, cf. Jer 5:22),
 he will honour me (Ps 50:23) is unusual; rarely in the perfect, Dt 24:13 ?????????.
?????
On examples like
 Gn 30:6, cf. § 26 g, § 59 f. In far the greatest number of cases,
however, this Nûn is assimilated to the following consonant (? , ?  ), or the latter is lost
in pronunciation (so ?), and the Nûn consequently sharpened. Hence we get the
following series of suffix-forms:—

Rem. The uncontracted forms with Nûn are rare, and occur only in poetic or elevated
style (Ex 15:2, Dt 32:10 [bis], Jer 5:22, 22:24); they are never found in the 3rd fem. sing. and
1st plur. On the other hand, the contracted forms are tolerably frequent, even in prose. An
??
example of

???????
In Ez 4:12 the Masora requires

 as 1st plur. occurs perhaps in Jb 31:15 [but read ?? ?? and cf. § 72 cc], hardly in
 behold us, Gn 44:16, 50:18, Nu 14:40 for ?????? (instead of ??????; see § 20 m).—

, without Dageš in the Nûn.

??????????

That the forms with Nûn energicum are intended to give greater emphasis to the verbal

form is seen from their special frequency in pause. Apart from the verb, however, Nûn
energicum occurs also in the union of suffixes with certain particles (§ 100 o).

This Nûn is frequent in Western Aramaic. In Arabic the corresponding forms are the two

energetic moods (see § 48 b) ending in an and anna, which are used in connexion with
suffixes (e.g. yaqtulan-ka or yaqtulanna-ka) as well as without them.

§ 59. The Perfect with Pronominal Suffixes.

1. The endings (afformatives) of the perfect occasionally vary somewhat from the

ordinary form, when connected with pronominal suffixes; viz.:—

(a) In the 3rd sing. fem. the original feminine ending ? ?? or ? ?? is used for ? ??.

4 4 So König, Lehrgeb., i. p. 226.
1 1 On ?? = ?? ?? Nu 23:13, see § 67 o.

(b) In the 2nd sing. masc. besides ?? we find ?, to which the connecting vowel is

directly attached, but the only clear instances of this are with

???
???

.2

?????
(c) In the 2nd sing. fem. ???, the original form of ??, appears; cf. ????,
44 g. This form can be distinguished from the 1st pers. only by the context.

?????

, § 32 f; §

(d) 2nd plur. masc. ?? for ???. The only examples are Nu 20:5, 21:5, Zc 7:5. The
fem. ????????? never occurs with suffixes; probably it had the same form as the masculine.

We exhibit first the forms of the perfect Hiph(cid:31)??l, as used in connexion with
suffixes, since here no further changes take place in the stem itself, except as regards
the tone (see c).

Singular.

3. m. ????????
3. f. ??????????
2. m. ??????????, ?????????
2. f. ???????????, ?????????
1. c. ???????????

3. c. ?????????

2. m. ??????????

1. c. ??????????

Plural.

The beginner should first practise connecting the suffixes with these Hiph(cid:31)??l forms and

then go on to unite them to the Perfect Qal (see d).

2. The addition of the suffix generally causes the tone to be thrown forward
towards the end of the word, since it would otherwise fall, in some cases, on the ante-
penultima; with the heavy suffixes (see e) the tone is even transferred to the suffix
itself. Considerations of tone, especially in the Perfect Qal, occasion certain vowel
changes: (a) the Qame? of the first syllable, no longer standing before the tone,
always becomes vocal Šewâ; (b) the original Patha? of the second syllable, which in
the 3rd sing. fem. and 3rd plur. had become Šewâ, reappears before the suffix, and, in
an open syllable before the tone, is lengthened to Qame?; similarly original ?? (as in the
3rd sing. masc. without a suffix) is lengthened to ?, e.g.

 1 S 18:22, Pr 19:7.

?????????

The forms of the perfect of Qal consequently appear as follows:—

Singular.

3. m. ?????
3. f. ??????? (???????, see g)
2. m. ???????? (???????, see h)
2. f. ????????? (???????, see h)
1. c. ?????????

3. c. ??????

2. m. ????????

1. c. ????????

Plural.

The connexion of these forms with all the suffixes is shown in Paradigm C. It will
be seen there also, how the ?ere in the Perfect Pi(cid:31)?l changes sometimes into Seghôl,
and sometimes into vocal Šewâ.

2 2 On the ? as an original element of the verbal form, see § 58 f, note.

Rem. 1. The suffixes of the 2nd and 3rd pers. plur. ??? and ???, since they end in a

consonant and also always have the tone, are distinguished as heavy suffixes (suffixa gravia)
from the rest, which are called light suffixes. Compare the connexion of these (and of the
corresponding feminine forms ??? and ???) with the noun, § 91. With a perfect ??? alone occurs,
Ps 118:26. The form ????? which is usually given as the connective form of the 3rd sing. masc.
before ??? and ??? is only formed by analogy, and is without example in the O.T.

2. In the 3rd sing. masc.

?????????

 (especially in verbs ???; in the strong verb only in Jer

3. The 3rd sing. fem. ??????? (=????????) has the twofold peculiarity that (a) the ending ath
always takes the tone,1 and consequently is joined to those suffixes which form a syllable of
themselves (???, ??, ??, ??, ??), without a connecting vowel, contrary to the general rule, § 58 f; (b)
before the other suffixes the connecting vowel is indeed employed, but the tone is drawn back
to the penultima, so that they are pronounced with shortened vowels, viz.
 it
???????????
 she loves thee, Ru 4:15, cf. Is 47:10;
burns them, Is 47:14, Jos 2:6, Ho 2:14, Ps 48:7. For
 &c., in pause ????? ??? is found,
Jer 8:21, Ps 69:10, and ???? ??? Ct 8:5; and also without the pause for the sake of the assonance
 (e.g. Ru 4:15) has arisen, through
???????????, she was in travail with thee, ibid. The form

Mapp??q in the ?, which is consequently always a more vowel-letter.

4. In the 2nd sing. masc. the form ???????? is mostly used, and the suffixes have, therefore,
 thou hast cast us off, thou hast broken us down, Ps

no connecting vowel, e.g.
60:3; but with the suff. of the 1st sing. the form
however, with Qame?, e.g.
????????
17:3 with Merekha.—In the 2nd sing. fem. ????— is also written defectively,
 1 S 19:17,
Ju 11:35, Jer 15:10, Ct 4:9. Occasionally the suffix is appended to the ordinary form ? ??, viz.
 thou (fem.) dost adjure us, Ct 5:9, Jos 2:17, 20; cf. Jer 2:27, and, quite abnormally,
???
?????? ????
with ?ere

Is 8:11

????????
 is probably intended as an imperfect.

 Ps 22:2; Ju 1:15 (with Zaqeph qa?on); but cf. also

15:16,

the tone (§ 44 e).

?????

???????????

 Ct 8:5 is an exception. ??? would probably even here have the tone (see e);

1 1
but no example of the kind occurs in the O.T. In Is 51:2 the imperfect is used instead
of the perfect with a suffix.

§ 60. Imperfect with Pronominal Suffixes.

In those forms of the imperfect Qal, which have no afformatives, the vowel ? of
the second syllable mostly becomes ?? (simple Šewâ mobile), sometimes ??; thus in the
principal pause, Nu 35:20, Is 27:3, 62:2, Jer 31:33, Ez 35:6, Ho 10:10; before the
principal pause, Ps 119:33; before a secondary pause, Ez 17:23; even before a
conjunctive accent, Jos 23:5. Before ?? ??, ??? ??, however, it is shortened to Qame?
?a?uph, e.g. ?????? ???? (but in pause
 or
??????? ????, &c. Instead of
??????
before suffixes in three places: Jer 2:19, Jb 19:15, Ct 1:6.

, the form ????????1 is used for the 2nd and 3rd fem. plur.

; with Nûn energicum, see §58 i),

???

Rem. 1. ?????????? Ps 94:20 is an anomalous form for ?????????? (cf. the analogous ???????? §67 n) and

?? ?????????? (so Baer; others ?? ?????????) Gn 32:18 for ?? ?????????. To the same category as ?????????? belong
also, according to the usual explanation, ?????????? (from
), Ex 20:5, 23:24, Dt 5:9, and
??????? Dt 13:3. As a matter of fact, the explanation of these forms as imperfects of Qal appears
to be required by the last of these passages; yet why has the retraction of the ? taken place
only in these examples (beside numerous forms like
)? Could the Masora in the two
Decalogues and in Ex 23:24 (on the analogy of which Dt 13:3 was then wrongly pointed)
have intended an imperfect Hoph(cid:31)al with the suffix, meaning thou shalt not allow thyself to
be brought to worship them?

?????????

?????

???

????

Verbs which have a in the second syllable of the imperfect, and imperative, Qal (to which

class especially verba tertiae and mediae gutturalis belong, § 64 and § 65) do not, as a rule,
change the Patha? of the imperfect (nor of the imperative, see § 61 g) into Šewâ before
suffixes; but the Patha?, coming to stand in an open syllable before the tone, is lengthened to
Qame?, e.g.
 Ps 145:18; but ???????? Jer 23:6,
 3:5; ????? ?????? Jos 8:3;
is probably a forma mixta combining the readings ???????? and ????????, cf. § 74 e.

gender of

??????  is probably to be regarded, with König, as a clumsy correction of

????????(cid:31)?????

.

4. In Pi(cid:31)?l, Pô(cid:31)?l, and Po(cid:31)l?l, the ?ere of the final syllable, like the ? in Qal, becomes
vocal Šewâ; but before the suffixes ?? ?? and ??? ?? it is shortened to Seghôl, e.g. ?????????? Dt 30:4, Ps
34:12, Is 51:2. With a final guttural, however, ??????? ???? Gn 32:27; also in Pr 4:8, where with
Qim?i
?????
??????
1:15, 52:12; so in Po(cid:31)l?l, Is 25:1, Ps 30:2, 37:34, 145:1, and probably also in Qal ????????? 1 S
15:6; cf. § 68 h.

 Dt 32:7. Less frequently ?ere is sharpened to ?ireq, e.g. ?????????? Jb 16:5, cf. Ex 31:13, Is

 is to be read. ? is retained in the tone-syllable; an analogous case in Hiph(cid:31)??l is

???????????

5. In Hiph(cid:31)??l the ?? remains, e.g.

 Jb 10:11 (after w?w consecutive it is often
written defectively, e.g. ? ?????????? Gn 3:21 and ofton); but cf. above, f, Dt 32:7. Forms like
????

 thou enrichest it, Ps 65:10, 1 S 17:25, are rare. Cf. § 53 n.

?????????

?? ??????

????

6. Instead of the suffix of the 3rd plur. fem. (?), the suffix of the 3rd plur. masc. (?) is
affixed to the afformative ?, to avoid a confusion with the personal ending ??; cf. ??????????? Gn
26:15 (previously also with a perf. ???????); Gn 26:18, 33:13, Ex 2:17 (where ??? ??????? occurs
 is for ????????, a neglect of gender
immediately after); 39:18, 20, 1 S 6:10 (where also
which can only be explained by § 135 o).—For ?????????? Zc 11:5 read perhaps ?????????? with M.
Lambert.

§ 61. Infinitive, Imperative and Participle with Pronominal Suffixes.

????

????????

 to inquire of me, Jer 37:7. As a rule

1. The infinitive construct of an active verb may be construed with an accusative,
and therefore can also take a verbal suffix, i.e. the accusative of the personal pronoun.
The only undoubted instances of the kind, however, in the O. T. are infinitives with
the verbal suffix of the 1st pers. sing., e.g.
the infinitive (as a noun) takes noun-suffixes (in the genitive, which may be either
subjective or objective, cf. § 115 c), e.g. ??????? my passing by; ?????? his reigning, see §
115 a and e. The infinitive Qal, then, usually has the form q??l, retaining the original
short vowel under the first radical (on the probable ground-form q???l, see § 46 a).
The resulting syllable as a rule allows a following Begadkephath to be spirant, e.g.
???????? in his writing, Jer 45:1; cf., however, ??????? Gn 19:21; ?????? (so ed. Mant.; others
??????) Ex 12:27; ??????? 1 Ch 4:10; before ?? ?? and ??? ?? also the syllable is completely
 Gn 27:42), unless the
closed, e.g. ????????? Ex 23:16, Lv 23:39 (but in pause  ?????????
vowel be retained in the second syllable; see d. With the form ????? generally, compare
 (before a suffix ????? or ?????), § 84a a; § 93 q.
the closely allied nouns of the form

???

??????

Rem. 1. The infin. of verbs which have ? in the last syllable of the imperfect of Qal,
sometimes takes the form qi?l before suffixes, e.g. ???????? Ex 21:8; ??????? Am 2:6 (but ??????? Ex
21:8) ?????? 2 S 1:10 (but ?????? 1 S 29:3), ???? ??? Zc 3:1, ????? ?? Lv 26:26, Ez 30:18 &c. According
to Barth (see above, § 47 i with the note) these forms with i in the first syllable point to
former i-imperfects.

Infinitives of the form ????? (§ 45 c) in verbs middle or third guttural (but cf. also ????? ?? Gn

19:33, 35—elsewhere ?????? ?? and ???? ??) before suffixes sometimes take the form qa?l, as ??????
Jon 1:15 (and, with the syllable loosely closed. ??????? Ju 13:25), ???????? and ???????? Ez 25:6;
sometimes qi?l, with the a attenuated to i, especially in verbs third guttural; as ????????, ???????,
 (1 Ch 12:17) and
???
???
???????, ??????, ???????, ???????—Contrary to § 58 f
. On ????? my following Ps 38:21 (but Qerê
??
???
 and
found with the infinitive instead of
???????), cf. the analogous examples in § 46 e.

 (Ex 14:11) are sometimes

??

???

???

???

2. With the suffixes ?? ?? and ??? ??, contrary to the analogy of the correspending nouns,
forms occur like ???????? thy eating, Gn 2:17; ????????? Gn 3:5; ???????? (others ?????????) Ob11, i.e. with ?
shortened in the same way as in the imperfect, see § 60. But the analogy of the nouns is
followed in such forms as ????????? your harvesting, Lv 19:9, 23:22 (with retention of the
original ?), and ????????? (read m??sekhèm) your despising, Is 30:12; cf. Dt 20:2; on ????????????
Gn 32:20 (for ???????), see § 74 h.—Very unusual are the infinitive suffixes of the 2nd sing.
masc. with ? energicum (on the analogy of suffixes with the imperfect, § 58 i), as
 Dt
4:36, cf. 23:5, Jb 33:32, all in principal pause.

??????

???

Examples of the infinitive Niph(cid:31)al with suffixes are, ?????????? Ex 14:18; ???????????? Dt 28:20

(in pause, ????????????? verse 24); ?????????? Ps 37:33; ???????????? Ez 21:29; ??????????? Dt 7:23. In the
infinitive of Pi(cid:31)?l (as also in the imperfect, see § 60 f) the ? before the suff. ?? ??, ??? ?? becomes
Seghôl, e.g.
infinitive Pô(cid:31)?l, ????? ????? occurs (with a for ? or ??) Am 5:11, but probably ????????, with
Wellhausen, is the right reading; the correction ? has crept into the text alongside of the
corrigendum ?.

 Ex 4:10, and with a sharpening to ?? ??? ??????? Is 1:15 (see § 60 f). In the

?????????

2. The leading form of the imperative Qal before suffixes (?????) is due probably
(see § 46 d) to the retention of the original short vowel of the first syllable (ground-
form q???l). In the imperative also ? is not followed by Dageš lene, e.g. ??????? k?thb?m
(not k?thb?m), &c.1 As in the imperfect (§ 60 d) and infinitive (see above, c), so also
in the imperative, suffixes are found united to the stem by an a-sound; e.g. ??????? Is
30:8; cf. 2 S 12:28.—The forms ???????, ??????, which are not exhibited in Paradigm C,
undergo no change. Instead of
imperfect.

, the masc. form (??????) is used, as in the

??????????

In verbs which form the imperative with a, like ??? ?? (to which class belong

??????????

 send me, Is 6:8,

especially verbs middle and third guttural, §§ 64 and 65), this a retains its place when
pronominal suffixes are added, but, since it then stands in an open syllable, is, as a
mattter of course, lengthened to Qame? (just as in imperfects Qal in a, § 60 c), e.g.
???? ??????
??? ???
??????
(so ed. Mant., Baer, Ginsb., instead of the ordinary reading
with Margolis, AJSL. xix, p. 45 ff., from an original ????????, as

original
suffixes is not the 2nd sing. masc. ???????, but ???????? (with ?? on account of the open

3. Like the infinitives, the participles can also be united with either verbal or
noun-suffixes; see § 116 f. In both cases the vowel of the participles is shortened or
becomes Šewâ before the suffix, as in the corresponding noun-forms, e.g. from the
form ?????: ????????, ???????, &c.; but before Šewâ mobile ?????????, &c., or with the original ??,
????????? Ex 23:4, &c., ????????? 2 K 22:20 (coinciding in form with the 1st sing. imperfect
Qal, 1 S 15:6; cf. § 68 h); with a middle guttural (????????), ????????; with a third guttural,
????????? Is 43:1, but ?????????, ??????? ???? Jer 28:16, cf. § 65 d. The form ???????, with suffix

§ 62. Verbs with Gutturals.

Brockelmann, Grundriss, p. 584 ff.

Verbs which have a guttural for one of the three radicals differ in their inflexion

from the ordinary strong verb, according to the general rules in § 22. These
differences do not affect the consonantal part of the stem, and it is, therefore, more
correct to regard the guttural verbs as a subdivision of the strong verb. At the most,
only the entire omission of the strengthening in some of the verbs middle guttural (as
well as in the imperfect Niph(cid:31)al of verbs first guttural) can be regarded as a real
weakness (§§ 63 h, 64 e). On the other hand, some original elements have been
preserved in guttural stems, which have degenerated in the ordinary strong verb; e.g.
the ? of the initial syllable in the imperfect Qal, as in ???????, which elsewhere is
attenuated to ??, ???????.—In guttural verbs ? and ? are only taken into consideration
when they are actual consonants, and not vowel-letters like the ? in some verbs ??? (§
68), in a few ??? (§ 73 g), and in most ??? (§ 74). In all these cases, however, the ?
was at least originally a full consonant, while the ? in verbs ??? was never anything
but a vowel letter, cf. § 75. The really consonantal ? at the end of the word is marked
by Mapp??q.—Verbs containing a ? also, according to § 22 q, 22 r, share some of the
peculiarities of the guttural verbs. For more convenient treatment, the cases will be
distinguished, according as the guttural is the first, second, or third radical. (Cf. the
Paradigms D, E, F, in which only those conjugations are omitted which are wholly
regular.)

§ 63. Verbs First Guttural, e.g. ????? to stand.

In this class the deviations from the ordinary strong verb may be referred to the

following cases:—

1. Instead of a simple Šewâ mobile, the initial guttural takes a compound Šewâ
(?a?eph, § 10 f, § 22 l). Thus the infinitives ?????, ????? to eat, and the perfects, 2nd
plur. masc. ?????????, ????????? from ????? to be inclined, correspond to the forms ????? and
?????????; also ?????? to
according to § 22 o.

, and so always with initial ?? before a suffix for an original ?,

??????

2. When a preformative is placed before an initial guttural, either the two may
form a closed syllable, or the vowel of the preformative is repeated as a ?a?eph under
the guttural. If the vowel of the preformative was originally a, two methods of
formation may again be distinguished, according as this a remains or passes into
Seghôl.

Examples: (a) of firmly closed syllables after the original vowel of the

preformative (always with ? in the second syllable, except ????????? Ez 23:5, ??????? &c.
from ????? to adorn oneself, and ???????; but cf. e): ???????, ???????, ???????, ????????, ??????? Jer 9:3

(probably to distinguish it from the name ????????, just as in Jer 10:19, &c., the
participle fem. Niph(cid:31)al of ????? is ??????? to distinguish it from ????????), &c., and so
generally in the imperfect Qal of stems beginning with ?, although sometimes parallel
forms exist, which repeat the ? as a ?a?eph, e.g. ????????, &c. The same form appears
also in the imperfect Hiph(cid:31)??l ????????, &c. Very rarely the original ? is retained in a
closed syllable under the preformative ?  of the perfect Niph(cid:31)al:
S 19:2, Jos 2:16; also the infinitive absolute ??????? Est 8:8, ??????? 1 Ch 5:20, and the
participle fem. ??????? (see above), plur. ????????? Pr 27:6. In these forms the original ? is
commonly kept under the preformative and is followed by ?a?eph-Patha?; thus in the
perfect of some verbs ???, e.g. ? ???????, &c.; in the infinitive absolute, ????????? Est 9:1; in
the participle ????????, Ps 89:8, &c.

 Gn 31:27; cf. 1

????

??????

(b) Of the corresponding ?a?eph after the original vowel: ??????? (but ???????? Jb 5:18

in pause), ???????, ????????, ????????, and so almost always with ? and often with ? in the
imperfects of Qal and Hiph(cid:31)??l; in Hoph(cid:31)al, ????????, ????????; but cf. also
??????? Ez 16:4.

?????????

 Is 42:22,

The ? of the preformative before a guttural almost always (§ 22 i, cf. § 27 p)

becomes Seghôl (cf., however, q). This Seghôl again appears sometimes

(c) in a closed syllable, e.g. ???????, ???????, ???????, ? ??????, always with ? in the second
syllable, corresponding to the imperfects of verbs ???, with original ?? in the first and ?
in the second syllable, § 67 n, and also to the imperfects of verbs ???, § 72 h; but cf.
also ???????, ???????, and ???????; in Niph., e.g. ????????; ?????? Am 6:6, &c.; in Hiph. ????????, ????????
2 K 4:7 &c.: sometimes

(d) followed by ?a?eph-Seghôl, e.g. ????????, ????????, ????????, ??????? in imperfect Qal;

????????? Hiph(cid:31)??l; ???????? Niph(cid:31)al.

Rem. With regard to the above examples the following points may also be noted: (1) The
forms with a firmly closed syllable (called the hard combination) frequently occur in the same
verb with forms containing a loosely closed syllable (the soft combination). (2) In the 1st
sing. imperfect Qal the preformative ? invariably takes Seghôl, whether in a firmly or loosely
closed syllable, e.g. ??????? (with the cohortative ? ????????), ??????? (in pause), &c. In Jb 32:17 ???????
must unquestionably be Hiph(cid:31)??l, since elsewhere the pointing is always ??????. Cohortatives
like ????????? Gn 27:41 and ???????? Jb 16:6, are explained by the next remark. (3) The shifting of
the tone towards the end frequently causes the Patha? of the preformative to change into
Seghôl, and vice versa, e.g. ? ???????, but ??? ??????? 3rd sing. fem.; ????????, but ?????????; ?????????, but with
w?w consecutive  ?????????????
generally a change of the stronger ?a?eph-Seghôl group ( ?? ???) into the lighter ?a?eph-Patha?
group takes place whenever the tone is moved one place toward the end (cf. § 27 v).

, &c.; so ?????????? Gn 8:3 the plur. of ?????????, cf. Gn 11:8; and thus

?

3. When in forms like ????????, ????????, the vowel of the final syllabl becomes a vocal

Šewâ in consequence of the addition of an afformative (?, ? ??, ? ??) or suffix, the
compound Šewâ of the guttural is changed into the corresponding short vowel, e.g.
????????, plur. ????????? (ya-(cid:31)a-me-dhû as an equivalent for ya(cid:31)-me-dhû); ?????????? she is
forsaken. But even in these forms the hard combination frequently occurs, e.g. ????????
they take as a pledge (cf. in the sing. ???????, also ????????); ???????? (also ?????????) they are
strong. Cf. m and, in general, § 22 m, § 28 c.

4. In the infinitive, imperative, and imperfect Niph(cid:31)al, where the first radical
should by rule be strengthened (???????, ???????), the strengthening is always omitted, and
the vowel of the preformative lengthened to ?ere; ???????? for yi(cid:31)(cid:31)?m?d, 1 &c. Cf. § 22
c—For ? ???????? Ex 25:31 (according to Dillmann, to prevent the pronunciation ? ???????,
which the LXX and Samaritan follow) read ? ???????.

REMARKS

On Qal.

??

??????  Is 5:24; ???????? Ec 3:8. Sometimes, however, ?a?eph-Patha? is found as well,

1. In verbs ??? the infinitive construct and imperative take ?a?eph-Seghôl in the first
syllable (according to § 22 o), e.g. ????? gird thou, Jb 38:3, ????? love thou, Ho 3:1, ????? seize
thou, Ex 4:4 (on ???? bake ye, Ex 16:23, see § 76 d); ????? to eat; infinitive with a prefix ????????,
????????,
e.g. infinitive ????? 1 K 6:6; ????? ???????? Nu 26:10 (before a suffix ????????, ????????, ?????????, ????????? § 61
d); cf. Dt 7:20, 12:23, Ez 25:8, Ps 102:5, Pr 25:7 (??????????), Jb 34:18, always in close
connexion with the following word. With a firmly closed syllable after ? cf. ??????? Is 30:2;

(Hiph(cid:31)il), adopted by Moore in Haupt’s Bible. According to Qim?i, Olshausen, and others,
the Masora intended a perfect Hoph(cid:31)al with syncope of the preformative after the ?
interrogative =
But since the Hiph(cid:31)il and Hoph(cid:31)al of ????? nowhere occur, it is difficult to believe that such
. But the Qame?
was the intention of the Masora. We should expect the perfect Qal,
under the ?, falling between the tone and counter-tone, was naturally less emphasized than in
, without the ? interrogative. Consequently it was weakened, not to simple Šewâ, but to
?????
??, in order to represent the sound of the Qame? (likewise pronounced as å) at least in a
shortened form. The Seghôl of the ? interrogative is explained, in any case, from § 100 n (cf.
the similar pointing of the article, e.g. in ?? ?????????, § 35 k). For the accusative after ?????, instead
of the usual ???, Jb 3:17 affords sufficient evidence.

Also in the other forms of the imperative the guttural not infrequently influences the
vowel, causing a change of ?? (on this ?? cf. § 48 i) into Seghôl, e.g. ??????? gather thou, Nu 11:16;
??????? set in order, Jb 33:5; ??? ???? strip off, Is 47:2 (on this irregular Dageš cf. § 46 d), especially
when the second radical is also a guttural, e.g. ??????? Am 5:15, Ps 31:24; cf. Zc 8:19;
????  Ct

such nouns as ?????, ?????, § 93 t.—On ?????????? Ps 94:20 for ????????? (according to Qim?i, and others,
rather Pu(cid:31)al) cf. § 60 b.

??????? Ps 58:5 and ??????? to deal subtilly, 1 S 23:22, Pr 15:5, 19:25, may be explained with
Barth (ZDMG. 1889, p. 179) as i-imperfects (see above, § 47 i),—the latter for the purpose of
distinction from the causative ????????? Ps 83:4.—Instead of the unintelligible form ???????????? (so
ed. Mant.; Baer and Ginsb. as in 24:3) 1 Ch 23:6 and ???????? 24:3 (partly analogous to ?????????? §

Pi(cid:31)?l (???????), can only be understood as a development of ???????? (cf. § 64 h on ????????, and §69
x on ????????? Ex 9:23, Ps 73:9). Path? has taken the place of ?a?eph-Patha?, but as a mere
helping-vowel (as in

5. In the verbs ????? to be, and ????? to live, the guttural hardly ever affects the

addition of preformatives; thus imperfect Qal ???????? and ???????, Niph(cid:31)al ????????); but in the
perfect Hiph(cid:31)??l ???????? (2nd plur. ???????????? Jos 2:13, and even without w?w consecutive,
Ju 8:19). Initial ? always has ?a?eph-Seghôl instead of vocal ?ewâ; ?????, ?????, ??????? 1 S
25:7, ???????? (except ????? be thou! fem. Gn 24:60). The 2nd sing. fem. imperative of ????? is
????? live thou, Ez 16:6; the infinitive, with suffix, ??????? Jos 5:8. After the prefixes ??, ??,
??  , ??, ??   (=???) both ? and ? retain the simple Šewâ (§ 28 b) and the prefix takes ??, as
elsewhere before strong consonants with Šewâ; hence in the perfect Qal ???????????,

imperative ???????, infinitive ???????, ???????? &c. (cf. §16 f, ?). The only exception is the 2nd
sing. masc. of the imperative after w?w; ???????? Gn 12:2, &c., ???????? Gn 20:7.

§ 64. Verbs Middle Guttural, e.g. ??? ?? to slaughter.

The slight deviations from the ordinary inflexion are confined chiefly to the

following1:—

1. When the guttural would stand at the beginning of a syllable with simple Šewâ,

it necessarily takes a ?a?eph, and almost always ?a?eph-Patha?, e.g. perfect ????? ??,
imperfect ???? ????, imperative Niph(cid:31)al ??????????. In the imperative Qal, before the
afformatives ?? and û, the original Patha? is retained in the first syllable, and is
followed by ?a?eph-Patha?, thus, ????????, ???????, &c.; in ?????? the preference of the ? for
Seghôl (but cf. also
6:22, even ?? remains before a hard guttural.

???????  Jer 13:21) has caused the change from ? to ?; in ????? ?? Jb

???

So in the infinitive Qal fem., e.g. ??????? to love, ???????? to pine; and in the infinitive with a
suffix ?????????? Is 9:6; the doubtful form ?????? ?? Ho 5:2, is better explained as infinitive Pi(cid:31)?l (=
?????? ??).

2. Since the preference of the gutturals for the a-sound has less influence on the
following than on the preceding vowel, not only is ?olem retained after the middle
guttural in the infinitive Qal ??? ?? (with the fem. ending and retraction and shortening
of the o ??????? and ???????? cf. § 45 b), but generally also the ?ere in the imperfect
Niph(cid:31)al and Pi(cid:31)?l, e.g. ??????? he fights, ??????? he comforts, and even the more feeble
Seghôl after w?w consecutive in such forms as
 Gn 41:8 (cf., however,
??
 1 K 12:6, &c.). But in the imperative and imperfect Qal, the final syllable,
through the influence of the guttural, mostly takes Patha?, even in transitive verbs,
e.g. ??? ??, ??? ????; ?????, ???????; ?????, ???????; with suffixes (according to § 60 c), imperative

With ? in the imperative Qal, the only instances are ????? 2 S 13:17; ????? Ex 4:4, 2

 Neh 7:3; without the pause ?????? Ct 2:15); ?????? Ju 19:8.2
2nd plur. masc. in pause
????????  for ????????, Nu 23:7, is an example of the same kind, see § 63 p. Just as
Finally
rare are the imperfects in ? of verbs middle guttural, as ???????, ????????, ??????? Lv 5:15,
Nu 5:27 (but ????????? 2 Ch 26:16); cf. ????? ?????? Ez 16:33; ???????? Jb 35:6. Also in the perfect
Pi(cid:31)?l, Patha? occurs somewhat more frequently than in the strong verb, e.g. ????? to
comfort (cf., however, ?????, ?????, ?????, ??? ??); but ? and ? always have ? in 3rd sing.—On
the infinitive with suffixes, cf. § 61 b.

3. In Pi(cid:31)?l, Pu(cid:31)al, and Hithpa(cid:31)?l, the Dageš forte being inadmissible in the

middle radical, the preceding vowel, especially before ?, ? and ?, nevertheless,

1 1 Hoph(cid:31)al, which is not exhibited in the paradigm, follows the analogy of Qal;
Hiph(cid:31)?(cid:31)l is regular.
2 2 Also Ju 19:5 (where Qim?i would read se(cid:31)?d), read se(cid:31)?d, and on the use of the
conjunctive accent (here Darga) as a substitute for Metheg, at. § 9 u (c) and § 16 b.

generally remains short, and the guttural is consequently to be regarded as, at least,
virtually strengthened, cf. §22 c; e.g. Pi(cid:31)?l ??? ??, ??????? Jos 14:1, ??????????? 1 K 14:10, ?????
Ex 10:13 (cf., however, ????? Gn 34:19;
?????????
participle ???????, &c.; in verbs ???, e.g. ?????), infinitive ??? ??, Pu(cid:31)al ????? (but cf. ???? Ps
36:13 from ?????, also the unusual position of the tone in
perfect Hithpa(cid:31)?l

 Ex 15:13, but in the imperfect and

1 Ez 21:18, and in the

????????

?????

?

The complete omission of the strengthening, and a consequent lengthening of the

preceding vowel, occurs invariably only with ? (????? Ez 16:4 is an exception;
also occurs, Ju 6:28), e g. ?????? (in pause ??????), imperfect ????????, Pu(cid:31)al
occurs regularly in the stems ?????, ?????, ?????, ?????, and in the Hithpa(cid:31)?l of ???, ???, and
???; on the other hand, ? is virtually strengthened in the perfects, ????? (once in the
imperfect, Jer 29:23) to commit adultery, ????? to despise (in the participle, Nu 14:23, Is
60:14, Jer 23:17; according to Baer, but not ed. Mant., or Ginsb., even in the imperfect
??????? Ps 74:10), ????? to abhor La 2:7 (also

????

Rem. 1. In the verb ?? ?? to ask, to beg, some forms of the perfect Qal appear to be based

upon a secondary form middle e, which is ?ere when the vowel of the ? stands in an open
 Ps 137:3; but in a closed syllable, even without a
??? ???
syllable, cf. ??????? ?? Gn 32:18, Ju 4:20;
????
suffix, ??????? ?? 1 S 12:13, 25:5, Jb 21:29;
 Ju 13:6, 1 S 1:20. Cf., however, similar cases
???
?????? ??
?
of attenuation of an original ?, § 69 s, and especially § 44 d. In the first three examples, if
explained on that analogy, the ?? attenuated from ? would have been lengthened to ? (before
the tone); in the next three ?? would have been modified to ?. Also in the Hiph(cid:31)il-form
???

 1 S 1:28 the ?? is merely attenuated from ?.

?????? ????
?

2. In Pi(cid:31)?l and Hithpa(cid:31)?l the lengthening of the vowel before the guttural causes the
tone to be thrown back upon the penultima, and consequently the ?ere of the ultima to be
shortened to Seghôl. Thus (a) before monosyllables, according to § 29 e, e.g.
 to
minister there, Dt 17:12, even in the case of a guttural which is virtually strengthened, Gn
39:14, Jb 8:18 (see § 29 g). (b) after w?w consecutive, e.g.
frequently,

3. The following are a few rarer anomalies; in the imperfect Qal ???????? Gn 21:6 (elsewhere

Pi(cid:31)?l ??????? Ju 5:28 (perhaps primarily for ???????; according to Gn 34:19 ??????? would be
?????
expected), and similarly
???????
?
above, § 52 n); finally, in the imperative Hiph(cid:31)??l ??????? Jb 13:21 and ??????? Ps 69:24, in both
cases probably influenced by the closing consonant, and by the preference for Path? in pause
(according to § 29 q); without the pause ??????? Pr 4:24, &c.; but also ??????? Jo 4:11.

4. As infinitive Hithpa(cid:31)?l with a suffix we find ? ?????????? Ezr 8:1, &c., with a firmly closed

syllable, also the participle ?? ?????????? Neh 7:64; Baer, however, reads in all these cases, on
good authority, ? ??????????? &c.—The quite meaningless Keth??bh ?????? Ez 9:8 (for which the

??(cid:31)???  is explained by Abulwal?(cid:31)d as the 3rd pers. perfect Pu(cid:31)al, but by Qim?i as a

 Is 44:13 (also

Qerê requires the equally unintelligible ?? ???????) evidently combines two different readings, viz.
?? ?????? (part. Niph.) and ??????????? (imperf. consec.); cf. König, Lehrgebäude, i. p. 266 f.—In
???
 in the same verse) an imperfect Pô(cid:31)?l appears to be intended
by the Masora with an irregular shortening of the ô for ?????????; cf. § 55 b ??? ?????? Ps 101:5 Qerê;
on the other hand Qim?i, with whom Delitzsch agrees, explains the form as Pi(cid:31)?l, with an
irregular ?? for ??, as in the reading ????????? Ru 2:2, 7; cf. § 10 h.

?????????

???

5. A few examples in which ?, as middle radical, entirely loses its consonantal value and

quiesces in a vowel, will be found in § 73 g.

§ 65. Verbs Third Guttural, e.g. ??? ?? to send.1

1. According to § 22 d, when the last syllable has a vowel incompatible with the

guttural (i.e. not an a-sound), two possibilities present themselves, viz. either the
regular vowel remains, and the guttural then takes furtive Patha?, or Patha? (in pause
Qame?) takes its place. More particularly it is to be remarked that—

(a) The unchangeable vowels ? ??, ?, ? (§ 25 b) are always retained, even under such

circumstances; hence inf. abs. Qal ???? ??, part. pass. ???? ??, Hiph. ????? ????, imperf. ????? ????,
part. ????? ????. So also the less firm ? in the inf. constr. ??? ?? is almost always retained:
cf., however, ??? ??, in close connexion with a substantive, Is 58:9, and ???? Nu 20:3.
Examples of the infinitive with suffixes are ?????????? Gn 35:1; ???????? Nu 35:19; ????????? Lv
18:23, &c.

(b) The imperfect and imperative Qal almost always have ? in the second syllable,

sometimes, no doubt, due simply to the influence of the guttural (for a tone-long ?,
originally ?), but sometimes as being the original vowel, thus ??? ????, ??? ??, &c.; with
suffixes

, see § 60 c.

????

???? ??????
,
???? ????

Exceptions, in the imperfect ????? Jer 5:7, Keth. (??????? Qerê); in the imperative ?????? Gn

43:16. On such cases as ??? ?????? Is 27:4, cf. § 10 h.

(c) Where ?ere would be the regular vowel of the final syllable, both forms (with
?a and ?) are sometimes in use; the choice of one or the other is decided by the special
circumstances of the tone, i.e.:—

Rem. 1. In the absolute state of the participle Qal, Pi(cid:31)?l and Hithpa(cid:31)?l, the forms ??????

(with suff. ????????, but ?????????), ???? ???? (with suff. ?????? ????), and ?????? ???? are used exclusively; except
in verbs ??? where we find, in close connexion, also
????? Is 42:5, 44:24, ????? Ps 136:6, ????? Lv 11:7, all with the tone on the last syllable.—The
part. Pu(cid:31)al is ??????? Ez 45:2 according to the best authorities (Kittel ???????).

?????  Ps 94:9, ????? Is 51:15, Jer 31:35,

2. Similarly, in the imperf. and inf. Niph(cid:31)al, and in the perf. inf. and imperf. Pi(cid:31)?l the
(probably more original) form with ? commonly occurs in the body of the sentence, and the
fuller form with ?a in pause (and even with the lesser distinctives, e.g. with Dehi Ps 86:4 in the
imperative Pi(cid:31)?l; with ?iph?a 1 K 12:32 in the infinitive Pi(cid:31)?l; Jer 4:31 imperfect
Hithpa(cid:31)?l; Jer 16:6 imperfect Niph(cid:31)al), cf. e.g. ??????? Nu 27:4, with ????????? 36:3; ?????????? Dt 1:34,
even with retraction of the tone in the inf. abs. Niph(cid:31)al ???????? Nu 30:3 (elsewhere ????????? Jer

????? to be high, ????? to be astonished, ????? (only in Hithpalpel) to delay.

devour Hb 1:13, Nu 4:20 with
absolute Pi(cid:31)??l has the from ???? ?? Dt 22:7, 1 K 11:22; the infinitive construct, on the other
hand, when without the pause is always as ??? ?? except ???? ???? Ex 10:4.— ???????? Hb 1:16 has ?,
though not in pause, and even ?????????? 2 K 16:4, 2 Ch 28:4; but a in pause in the imperative
Niph(cid:31)al
 Ez 21:11; jussive Pi(cid:31)?l ?????? Ps 40:18; cf. § 52 n. An example of ? in the
imperative Pi(cid:31)?l under the influence of a final ? is ?????? Jb 36:2, in the imperfect Niph(cid:31)al
?????????? Nu 17:13, &c.—In ???????? Jb 14:9 (cf. Ps 92:14, Pr 14:11), Barth (see above, § 63 n) finds
an i-imperfect of Qal, since the intransitive meaning is only found in Qal.

3. In the 2nd sing. masc. of the imperative, and in the forms of the jussive and imperfect
consecutive of Hiph(cid:31)??l which end in gutturals, a alone occurs, e.g. ??????? prosper thou, ??????? let
him make to trust, ????????? and he made to grow (so in Hithpalpel ???????????, &c., Hb 2:3); even in
pause
perhaps to be emended into ???? ????? (=??? ??????).—In the infinitive absolute ?ere remains, e.g. ????????

ordinary strong form remains when not connected with suffixes, e.g.
?????

Rem. The soft combination with compound Šewâ occurs only in the 1st plur. perfect with

suffixes, since in these forms the tone is thrown one place farther forward, e.g.
know thee, Ho 8:2 (cf. Gn 26:29, Ps 44:18, 132:6). Before the suffixes ?? and ???, the guttural
must have ??, e.g. ??????? ???? I will send thee, 1 S 16:1; ??????? ??????? Gn 31:27;

The Weak Verb.1

§ 66. Verbs Primae Radicalis Nûn (???), e.g. ????? to approach

Brockelmann, Semit. Sprachwiss., p. 138 ff.; Grundriss, p. 595 ff.

The weakness of initial ?  consists chiefly in its suffering aphaeresis in the
infinitive construct and imperative in some of these verbs (cf. § 19 h). On the other
hand, the assimilation of the ?  (see below) cannot properly be regarded as weakness,
since the triliteral character of the stem is still preserved by the strengthening of the
second consonant. The special points to be noticed are—

1. The aphaeresis of the Nûn (a) in the infinitive construct. This occurs only
(though not necessarily) in those verbs which have a in the second syllable of the
imperfect. Thus from the stem ???, imperfect ?????, infinitive properly ???, but always

1 1 Cf. the summary, § 41.

???? ?? 2; with suffix ?? ????

lengthened by the feminine termination ? to the segholate form
Gn 33:3; with the concurrence of a guttural ????? to touch, imperfect ?????, infinitive
(also ??????, see below); ????? to plant, infinitive
????? to give, see especially h and i. On the other hand, aphaeresis does not take place in
verbs which have ? in the imperfect, e.g. ????? to fall, imperfect ?????, infinitive ?????, with
suffix ??????, also ??????; ??????? Nu 6:2, &c.; cf., moreover, ???????? Gn 20:6, &c., ??????? Ex
19:12 (even ???????? Jb 6:7; cf. Jer 1:10); with suffix ???????? Lv 15:23. Also ???????? Is 51:16
(but

??????  (also ??????, see below); on the verb

 Ec 3:2); ???? Is 1:14, 18:3; with suffix ??? ?????? Ps 28:2 (elsewhere ??? ??, cf. § 74

????????

??

(b) In the imperative. Here the Nûn is always dropped in verbs with a in the
imperfect, e.g. ???, imperative ??? (more frequently with paragogic ?, ? ????; before
Maqqeph also ???? Gn 19:9), plur. ????, &c. Parallel with these there are the curious
?? ??  Ru 2:14 (with retarding Metheg in the second syllable, and also
forms with ?,
nasog a?or, according to § 29 e, before  ?????
), 1 S 14:38
(before ?????) and 2 Ch 29:31; in all these cases without the pause. With Nûn retained,
as if in a strong verb, ????? drive, 2 K 4:24 (imperfect ???????, without assimilation of the
Nûn), ???????? 2 K 19:29, Is 37:30, Jer 29:5, 28; cf. also the verbs ???, which are at the
same time ???; ????? Ez 32:18, ????? Ex 32:34, ????? Ex 8:1, &c.; the verb ???, ? ???? Ps 10:12
(usually ? ??); cf. § 76 b. But, as in the infinitive, the aphaeresis never takes place in
verbs which have ? in the imperfect, e.g. ?????, ?????, &c.

??  Jos 3:9 (before

) and

?????

??

2. When, through the addition of a preformative, Nûn stands at the end of a
syllable, it is readily assimilated to the second radical (§ 19 c); thus in the imperfect
Qal, 1 e.g. ????? for yinp?l, he will fall;
??????  for yingaš; ????? for yint?n, he will give (on
this single example of an imperfect with original i in the second syllable, cf. h)2; also
in the perfect Niph(cid:31)al ????? for ningaš; throughout Hiph(cid:31)??l (??????, &c.) and Hoph(cid:31)al
(which in these verbs always has Qibbu?, in a sharpened syllable, cf. § 9 n) ?????.

The other forms are all quite regular, e.g. the perfect, infinitive absolute and

participle Qal, all Pi(cid:31)?l, Pu(cid:31)al, &c.

In Paradigm H, only those conjugations are given which differ from the regular

form.

The characteristic of these verbs in all forms with a preformative is Dageš following it in

the second radical. Such forms, however, are also found in certain verbs ??? (§ 71), and even
in verbs ??? (§ 67). The infinitive
resemble the corresponding forms of verbs ??? (§ 69).—On ?????, ???, and
see g.—In ????? (imperfect Niph(cid:31)al of ???), and in similar forms of verbs ??? (§ 72), the full
writing of the ô indicates, as a rule, that they are not to be regarded as imperfects Qal of ?????,

???? ??  and the imperative ???, also ???? (Gn 19:9) and ???,

?????? , from ????? to take,

2 2The law allowing the addition of the feminine termination to the unlengthened
form, instead of a lengthening of the vowel, is suitably called by Barth ‘the law of
compensation’ (Nominalbildung, p. xiii).
1 1 Cf. Mayer Lambert, ‘Le futur qal des verbes ???, ???, ???’, in the REJ. xxvii, 136 ff.
2 2An imperfect in a (?????) is given in the Paradigm, simply because it is the actual
form in use in this verb.

&c.—Also ????? (Ps 139:8) is not to be derived from ???, but stands for ??????? (with a
sharpening of the ? as compensation for the loss of the ?), from ????? to ascend, see § 19 f, and
Kautzsch, Gramm. des Bibl.-Aram., § 44. Similarly the Hiph(cid:31)il-forms ???????? Ez 39:9, ??????? Is
44:15, and the Niph(cid:31)al ???????? Ps 78:21 are most probably from a stem ????, not ????.

Rem. 1. The instances are comparatively few in which the forms retain their Nûn before a

???

??????

firm consonant, e.g. ?????, imperfect ??????? Jer 3:5 (elsewhere ?????); also from ????? the pausal
form is always
 (without the pause ?????? Pr 20:28); similarly in Is 29:1, 58:3, Ps 61:8,
68:3 (where, however, ??????? is intended), 140:2, 5, Pr 2:11, Jb 40:24, the retention of the Nûn
is always connected with the pause. In Niph(cid:31)al this never occurs (except in the irregular inf.
????????? Ps 68:3, cf. § 51 k), in Hiph(cid:31)??l and Hoph(cid:31)al very seldom; e.g. ??????????? Ez 22:20, ????????
Ju 20:31; for ??????? Nu 5:22 read ???????, according to § 53 q. On the other hand, the Nûn is
regularly retained in all verbs, of which the Second radical is a guttural, e.g. ??????? he will
possess, although there are rare cases like ????? (also ???????) he will descend, Jer 21:13 (even
Pr 17:10; without apparent reason accented as Mil(cid:31)?l), plur.
???????  Jb 21:13 (cf. § 20 i; the
Masora, however, probably regards ????? and
????? for ??????? he has grieved.

???????  as imperfect Niph(cid:31)al from ?????); Niph(cid:31)al

??????

2. The ? of ????? to take is treated like the Nûn of verbs ??? (§ 19 d). Hence imperfect Qal
?????, cohortative (§ 20 m) ???????, imperative ???, in pause and before suffixes ??? (on ?????????? Gn
48:9, see § 61 g), paragogic form ?????; ?????, &c. (but cf. also ????? Ex 29:1, Ez 37:16, Pr 20:16,
??????? 1 K 17:11, perhaps a mistake for ????? ???, cf. LXX and Lucian); infinitive construct
(once ????? 2 K 12:9, cf. § 93 h); with ??,
imperfect ?????; Niph(cid:31)al, however, is always ???????.—The meaningless form ??? Ez 17:5 is a
mistake; for the equally meaningless ????? Ho 11:3 read ??????????.

; with suffix ???????; Hoph(cid:31)al (cf., however, § 53 u)

????????

??????

3. The verb ????? to give, mentioned above in d, is the only example of a verb ??? with
imperfect in ? (????? for yint?n; ??????1 only in Ju 16:5, elsewhere before Maqqeph ??????, &c.), and a
corresponding imperative ??? or (very frequently) ????? (but in Ps 8:2 the very strange reading
????? is no doubt simply meant by the Masora to suggest ????????); before Maqqeph ????, fem. ?????,
&c. Moreover, this very common verb has the peculiarity that its final Nûn, as a weak nasal,
is also assimilated;
compensation for the assimilated Nûn (cf. § 44 g); Niph(cid:31)al perfect ??????? Lv 26:25, Ezr 9:7.

In the infinitive construct Qal the ground-form tint is not lengthened to tèneth (as

??????

from ?????), but contracted to titt, which is then correctly lengthened to ???, with the omission of
Dageš forte in the final consonant, see § 20 l; but with suffixes ?????, ????, &c.; before Maqqeph
with the prefix ?? = ???????, e.g. Ex 5:21, and even when closely connected by other means, e.g.
Gn 15:7. However, the strong formation of the infinitive construct also occurs in ????? Nu
20:21 and ?????? Gn 38:9; cf. § 69 m, note 2. On the other hand, for ??????? 1 K 6:19 read either
?????? or simply ?????, just as the Qerê, 1 K 17:14, requires ??? for ???.

In other stems, the ?  is retained as the third redical, e.g.

1 1P. Haupt on Ju 16:5 in his Bible, compares the form of the Assyrian imperfect
iddan or ittan (besides inádin, inámdin) from nadânu = ???. But could this one
passage be the only trace left in Hebrew of an imperf. in a from ????

Brockelmann, Semit. Sprachwiss., p. 155 ff.; Grundriss, p. 632 ff. B. Harper, ‘The
Participial formations of the Geminate Verbs’ in ZAW. 1910, pp. 42 ff., 99 ff., 201 ff.
(also dealing with the regular verb).

1. A large number of Semitic stems have verbal forms with only two radicals, as
well as forms in which the stem has been made triliteral by a repetition of the second
radical, hence called verbs ???. Forms with two radicals were formerly explained as
being due to contraction from original forms with three radicals. It is more correct to
regard them as representing the original stem (with two radicals), and the forms with
the second radical repeated as subsequently developed from the monosyllabic stem.1
The appearance of a general contraction of triliteral stems is due to the fact that in
biliteral forms the second radical regularly receives Dageš forte before afformatives,
except in the cases noted in § 22 b and q. This points, however, not to an actual
doubling, but merely to a strengthening of the consonant, giving more body to the
monosyllabic stem, and making it approximate more to the character of triliteral
forms.

The development of biliteral to triliteral stems (???) generally takes place in the
3rd sing. masc. and fem. and 3rd plur. perfect Qal of transitive verbs, or at any rate of
verbs expressing an activity, e.g. ?????, ????????, ???????: ????? Gn 33:5 (but with suffix
,
????????
ver. 11); sometimes with an evident distinction between transitive and intransitive
forms, as ????? to make strait, ??? to be in a strait; see further details, including the
exceptions, in aa. The development of the stem takes place (a) necessarily whenever
the strengthening of the 2nd radical is required by the character of the form (e.g. ?????,
??? ??), and (b) as a rule, whenever the 2nd radical is followed or preceded by an
essentially long vowel, as, in Qal, ?????, ?????, in Pô(cid:31)l and Pô(cid:31)al, ?????, ?????.

2. The biliteral stem always (except in Hiph(cid:31)??l and the imperfect Niph(cid:31)al, see
below) takes the vowel which would have been required between the second and third
radical of the ordinary strong form, or which stood in the ground-form, since that
vowel is characteristic of the form (§ 43 b), e.g. ??? answering to ?????,
??????  to the
ground-form q???l?t,

?????  to the ground-form q???lû; infinitive, ??? to ?????.

3. The insertion of Dageš forte (mentioned under a), for the purpose of

strengthening the second radical, never takes place (see § 20 l) in the final consonant
of the word, e.g. ???, ???, not ????, ???; but it appears again on the addition of
,
,
afformatives or suffixes, e.g.  ?????

, &c.

?????

????

????

4. When the afformative begins with a consonant (? , ?), and hence the strongly
pronounced second radical would properly come at the end of a closed syllable, a
separating vowel is inserted between the stem-syllable and the afformative. In the
perfect this vowel is ?, in the imperative and imperfect ? ??, e.g.

???
,

, imperfect

???????

????

1 1 So (partly following Ewald and Boöttcher) A. Müller, ZDMG. xxxiii. p. 698 ff.;
Stade, Lehrbuch, § 385 b, c; Nöldeke, and more recently Wellhausen, ‘Ueber einige
Arten schwacher Verba im Hebr.’ (Skizzen u. Vorarb. vi. 250 ff.). Against Böttcher
see M. Lambert, REJ. xxxv. 330 ff., and Brockelmann, as above.

 (for sabb-t?, sabb-nû, tas?bb-n?). The artificial opening of the syllable by this

???????????
means is merely intended to make the strengthening of the second radical audible.1

The perfect

????  (for

???

????

) Nu 17:28, Ps 64:7 (Jer 44:18 ??????? with Silluq), owing to

omission of the separating vowel, approximates, if the text is right, to the form of verbs ???
(cf.

????  from ???).

???

5. Since the preformatives of the imperfect Qal, of the perfect Niph(cid:31)al, and of
Hiph(cid:31)??l and Hoph(cid:31)al throughout, before a monosyllabic stem form an open syllable,
they take a long vowel before the tone (according to § 27 e), e.g. imperfect Hiph(cid:31)??l
????? for y?-s?b, imperative ????? for y?-s?b, &c. Where the preformatives in the strong
verb have ??, either the original ? (from which the ?? was attenuated) is retained and
lengthened, e.g. ????? in imperfect Qal for y?-s?b, or the ?? itself is lengthened to ?, e.g.
????? perfect Hiph(cid:31)??l for h??-s?b (see further under h). The vowel thus lengthened can
be maintained, however, only before the tone (except the û of the Hoph(cid:31)al, ????? for
h?-s?b); when the tone is thrown forward it becomes Šewâ, according to § 27 k (under
? and ? compound Šewâ), e.g. ?????, but
???????????
perfect ?????????, &c.

; imperfect Hiph(cid:31)??l ?????, but

;
???????????

Besides the ordinary form of the imperfects, there is another (common in Aramaic), in

???????

?????????

 Nu 14:35, &c. (in pause

 1 S 2:9; ??????? Jb
 occurs (cf. § 10 h) in Nu 23:25; Imperfect Hiph(cid:31)??l ?????, Hoph(cid:31)al

which the imperfect Qal is pronounced ????? or ?????, the first radical, not the second, being
strengthened by Dageš forte, cf. ?????? 1 K 9:8, ??????? Gn 24:26; with a in the second syllable,
??????  Lv 11:7, ????? Is 17:4, ???????? Is 2:9, &c., ????? Am 5:13 and frequently, ???????? Dt 9:21, &c.,
????? (turn intrans.) 1 S 5:8, &c., ??????? Lv 24:11, ????? Ez 47:12, &c., ????? (with Dageš forte
???????
implicitum) 1 K 1:1; in the plural,
?????, ?????? (unless these forms are rather to be referred to Niph(cid:31)al, like
24:24); with suffix
?????, &c. The vowel of the preformative (which before Dageš is, of course, short) follows the
analogy of the ordinary strong form (cf. also u and y). The same method is then extended to
forms with afformatives or suffixes, so that even before these additions the second radical is
 and they bowed the head; ???????? and they
not strengthened, e.g.  ???????
???
 Ju
beat down, Dt 1:44 (from ?????); ???????? Dt 32:8; ?????? Ex 15:16, Jb 29:21 (cf., however,

??

Rem. According to the prevailing view, this strengthening of the first radical is merely

intended to give the bi-literal stem at least a tri-literal appearance. (Possibly aided by the
analogy of verbs ???, as P. Haupt has suggested to me in conversation.) But cf. Kautzsch, ‘Die
sog. aramaisierenden Formen der Verba ??? im Hebr.’ in Oriental. Studien zum 70.
Geburtstag Th. Nöldekes, 1906, p. 771 ff. It is there shown (1) that the sharpening of the 1st
radical often serves to emphasize a particular meaning (cf. ?????, but

, ????? and ?????, ?????,

??????

???

1 1 Of all the explanations of these separating vowels the most satisfactory is that of
Rödiger, who, both for the perfect and imperfect (Ewald and Stade, for the imperfect
 as formed
at least), points to the analogy of verbs ???. We must, however, regard  (cid:31)??????
on the analogy not of
?azauta), while ?????????? follows the analogy of ??????????. [See also Wright, Comp. Gr.,
229 f.]

, but (with P. Haupt) of a form  (cid:31)???

 (= g?laut?, cf. Arab.

????(cid:31)???

???

and ?????, ?????? and ? ????), and elsewhere no doubt to dissimilate the vowels (as ?????, ????? never
?????, ????? &c.): (2) that the sharpening of the 1st radical often appears to be occasioned by the
nature of the first letter of the stem, especially when it is a sibilant. Whether the masoretic
pronunciation is based on an early tradition, or the Masora has arbitrarily adopted aramaizing
forms to attain the above objects, must be left undecided.

6. The original vowel is retained, see f, (a) in the preformative of the imperfect

Qal ????? for y?-s?b (cf. §§ 47 b, 63 b, and for verbs ??? § 72); (b) in the perfect
Niph(cid:31)al ????? for n?-s?b (§ 51 a); (c) in Hoph(cid:31)al ?????, with irregular lengthening (no
doubt on the analogy of verbs ???) for h?s?b from h?-sab, imperfect ????? from y?-sab,
&c.

On the other hand, an already attenuated vowel (i) underlies the intransitive

imperfects Qal with ? in the second syllable (probably for the sake of dissimilating the
two vowels), e.g. ????? for y??-m?r (see p); and in the preformative of Hiph(cid:31)??l ????? from
h??-s?b (ground-form ???????, § 53 a), as well as of the participle ????? (ground-form ???????),
on the analogy of the perfect. In the second syllable of the Perf. the underlying vowel
is ??, attenuated from an original ?, which in the strong verb is abnormally lengthened
to ?? (§ 53 a). The lengthened from ?? is, of course, only tone-long, and hence when
without the tone and before Dageš forte we have e.g.
original ? in the second syllable, cf. v.

in the strong verb) pass to the afformatives ? ??, ? and ? ?? (2nd sing. fem. imperfect); e.g.

the tone is moved forward to these vowels (or to the final syllable, cf. ee), e.g.
???????????
, &c.; except before the endings ??? and ??? in the perfect, which always bear the
tone. This shifting of the tone naturally causes the shortening of the merely tone-long
vowels ? and ? to ?? and ? (or ?, see n), hence
cases in which the vowel of the preformative becomes Šewâ, see above, f

8. In several verbs ???, instead of Pi(cid:31)?l, Pu(cid:31)al and Hithpa(cid:31)?l, the less frequent

conjugation Pô(cid:31)?l, with its passive and reflexive, occurs (most probably on the
analogy of the corresponding forms of verbs ???, cf. § 72 m), generally with the same
meaning,1 e.g. ????? to ill-treat, passive ?????, reflexive ????????? (from ?????; cf. the
Hithpô(cid:31)?l from ????? and ????? Is 24:19 f.); in a few verbs also Pilp?l (§ 55 f) is found,
e.g. ??????? to roll, Hithpalp?l ??????????? to roll oneself (from ?????); imperative with suffix
?????????? exalt her, Pr 4:8; ? ????? ?? to comfort, to delight in; passive ? ????? ?? to be caressed
(from ??? ??). These forms cannot appear in a biliteral form any more than Pi(cid:31)?l,

1 1 Sometimes both Pi(cid:31)?l and Pô(cid:31)?l are formed from the same stem, though with a
difference of meaning, e.g. ????? to break in pieces, ????? to oppress; ????? to make
pleasing, ????? to have pity; ????? to turn, to change,  ?????

 to go round, to encompass.

REMARKS

On Qal.

1. In the perfect, isolated examples are found with ? in the first syllable, which it is
 they are
?????  Is 1:6 to ?????. But this

customary to refer to triliteral stems with middle ? (like ?????, § 43 a); viz.
exalted, Jb 24:24 to ?????;
?????
explanation is very doubtful:
mentioned in § 52 e.

 they shot, Gn 49:23 to ?????;
?????  especially is rather to be classed among the passives of Qal

?????

2. Imperfects Qal with ? in the second syllable keep the original a in the preformative, but
lengthen it to ?, as being in an open syllable, hence ?????, ?????, ?????, ?????, ?????? (trans. he breaks in
pieces, but ????? intrans.= he is evil); imperfects with ? have, in the preformative, an ?,
lengthened from ??. See the examples below, under p, § 63 c and e, § 72 h, and specially Barth
in ZDMG. 1894, p. 5 f.

The ??l?m of the infinitive, imperative, and imperfect (???, ?????) is only tone-long, and

therefore, as a rule, is written defectively (with a few exceptions, chiefly in the later
orthography, e.g. ??? bind up, Is 8:16; ??? Ps 37:5; ??? ver. 7; ?????? for ????? to plunder, Est 3:13,
8:11). When this ? loses the tone, it becomes in the final syllable ?, in a sharpened syllable ?,
or not infrequently even ? (see above, k). Examples of ? are: (a) in a toneless final syllable,
i.e. before Maqqeph or in the imperfect consecutive, ???? (r?n) to rejoice, Jb 38:7;
11:18 (once even with ? in a toneless final syllable,

Imperfects, with an original u in the second syllable, are also found with this ? lengthened

an imperfect from ??? to be powerful, to prevail); ????? (if from ???) Is 42:4, &c. (also
defectively ???? Ps 18:30; but in Ec 12:6, according to Baer, ???????); ????? Ez 24:11 (on the

A similar analogy with verbs ??? is soon in the infinitives ????? (for ???) Ec 9:1; ?????? Pr

5. Besides the ordinary form of the perfect  ?????  with Patha? (in pause ?????) and the
participle ????? with Qame? in the second syllable, there is also another with ?ere, and a third
with ?olem, e.g. perfect ????? it melts, Ez 21:12, 22:15;
molten, 1 S 15:9, Na 2:11; ????? it is a light thing, 2 K 20:10, Is 49:6 (perf. ?????); with ?, e.g.
???
 they are rolled together, Is 34:4; cf. 63:19, 64:2, Am 3:11, Na 1:12, Ec 12:6b. In the
imperfect with ? in the second syllable, on the analogy of verbs ??? (from which König would
also explain the perfects with ?), we find
????????
(unless this form should be referred to Qal with Qim?i, Olshausen, König); ?????? he suffers
hurt, Pr 11:15, 13:20; ????? (for tirr??) Ez 29:7; with ? in the second syllable ????? she profanes
 Is 48:11, ????? Is 7:8, &c. For infinitives, cf. ????? to
herself, Lv 21:9, but ???????? Ez 22:26, and
melt, Ps 68:3 (as inf. constr.; 2 S 17:10 as inf. absol.); again, with compensatory lengthening
in the first syllable, ????? Ez 20:9, 14:22, but with suffix ??????? Lv 21:4; also ????? to be

??????

3 3 According to Stade, Grammatik, § 95, Rem., the pronunciation with û, since it also

????????
2 S 19:44, and a Patha? occurs before ? (with a virtual sharpening of the ?) in such forms as

In General.

9. Verbs ??? are most closely related as regards inflexion to verbs ??? (§ 72). The form of

verbs ??? is generally the shorter (cf. e.g. ????? and ?????, ????? and ??????); in a few cases,
however, the two classes exactly coincide, e.g. in the imperfect Qal and Hiph(cid:31)??l with w?w
consecutive, in Hoph(cid:31)al and in the less common conjugations (see above, l).

10. The developed forms (with three radicals), as mentioned in a, are especially frequent

? ???

 &c.); ?????, ????????, ??????, &c. Sometimes the contracted, as well as the uncontracted form,

in the 3rd sing. masc. and fem., and the 3rd plur. perf. Qal (i.e. in forms without an
afformative or with an afformative beginning with a vowel) of transitive verbs, or verbs, at
,
any rate, expressing action, e.g. ?????, ??????? (but before a suffix also
????
?????
is found, e.g. ????? to plunder, plur. ???????; in other parts, only
 Jer 4:28. Other examples of biliteral forms in 2nd sing. masc.
????
3:7
are Dt 25:12, Pr 30:32; in 1st sing., Jos 5:9. A part from Qal the only example of a developed

 Gn 31:19 (also ????? Gn 38:13); cf. also ??????? Is
47:14, in subordinate pause, for ????????; with suffix ???????????? Is 30:18, and, from the same form

 Ps 9:14); in the imperfect, ????? Na 3:7 (Ps 68:13; cf. Gn 31:40) from ???;
ibid. also on
the strong form here, after the assimilation of the Nûn, was unavoidable. On the other hand,
????? ???? Jer 5:6 is anomalous for ??? ???? (Pr 11:3 Qerê; the eastern school read the Po(cid:31)?l ?????? in
the Keth??bh); the strengthening of the second radical has been afterwards resolved by the
insertion of a vocal Šewâ. Cf. also ???????? Am 5:15 (elsewhere ?????). In Niph(cid:31)al, the triliteral
form ??????? is found, Jb 11:12; in Hiph(cid:31)il, all the forms of ???, thus imperative
????????; infinitive ??? ???? Mi 6:13; participle ???? ???? Ez 3:15. That the developed (triliteral) forms
possess a certain emphasis is seen from their frequent use in pause, as in Ps 118:11 after a
biliteral form (

THE WEAKEST VERBS (Verba Quiescentia).

§ 68. Verbs ??? e.g. ???? to eat.

Brockelmann, Semit. Sprachwiss., p. 140 ff.; Grundriss, p. 589 ff.

So far as ? retains its full consonantal value as a guttural, these verbs share all the
peculiarities of verbs primae gutturalis, mentioned in § 63. They are, however, to be
treated as weak verbs, when the ? loses its value as a consonant, and coalesces with
the preceding vowel (originally short) to form one long syllable. This takes place only
in the following very common verbs and forms, as if through phonetic decay:—

1. In the imperfect Qal, five verbs (viz. ???? to perish, ???? to be willing, ???? to eat,
???? to say, ???? to bake) regularly make the ? quiesce in a long ô, e.g. ??????.1 In a few
others the ordinary (strong) form is also in use, as ?????? (18 times) and ???????? (3 times)
he takes hold;
?????  (see h), also ????????, he collects. This ô has primarily arisen from an
obscuring of ô (§ 9 q), and the â from ?? ??, the weak consonant ? coalescing with ? to
â; cf. § 23 a.

In the second syllable ? (for original ?) never appears, but either ?2 or ?; and in
pause almost always ?, even before the tone-bearing heavy afformative ??, e.g. ?????????

1 1 So in the modern vulgar Arabic of South Palestine, yakul (he eats) becomes yôkul.
2 2 On this ? (originally ?(cid:31)) as a dissimilation from ? (originally ?), cf. § 27 w, and F.
Philippi, in the Zeitschrift für Völkerpsychologie und Sprachwissenschaft, xiv. 178.
The latter rightly observes that the existence of an original u in the imperfect of  ????

 is

??

 Jer 5:2, Ps 145:6, 11,
 Jer 23:38, with Segolta; cf. also ??????? 1 S 1:7, &c. But with conjunctive

Dt 18:1, without the pause ????????? Dt 4:28. In the 3rd sing. masc. and 1st sing. of ????,
however, ? is always retained in pause,
 1
?????
K 5:20, in the 3rd fem. ??????? Pr 1:21; in the plural
???
accents in the body of the sentence, ? (as being a lighter vowel) is used, e.g.
?????? Ps 9:19, but in pause ??????? Ps 1:6; cf. a similar interchange of ? and ? in § 65 c.
The 3rd fem. plur. impf. always has the form

; but in the 2nd masc.
?????

??????
???

 Zc 11:9.

 and

?????

?????

?????

?????

? ?

??

??????

When the tone moves back, the final syllable of the imperfects of ???? and ????,

with a conjunctive accent, also always takes Patha?, e.g.
?????  and
????
he did eat; in ???? the loss of the tone from the final syllable only occurs in the form
with w?w consecutive (but never in the 1st sing. ????????; cf. ????????), and then the final
syllable, if without the pause, always takes Seghôl,

???
is due to contraction from the group  ?? ???(or  ?? ??) in place of  ?? ??; e.g. ?????? it shall come, Mi
4:8, from ???????? (from ????);
 Ho 11:1, 14:5, &c. (but only in 1st sing., otherwise  ???????
???
with suffixes
 and I stayed, Gn 32:5. The infinitive construct of ???? with ?? is always ??????
????);
??
dicendo, for ????????.—According to Barth (ZDMG. 1889, p. 179)
????  Nu 11:25 is to be
regarded as an imperfect Qal, without the obscuring of ? ?? to ô, not as imperfect Hiph(cid:31)??l,
since ??? elsewhere occurs only in the perfect Qal and Niph(cid:31)al; on the original i in the
second syllable, see above, § 67 p. For
??????
view that it is imperfect Pô(cid:31)?l (which nowhere else occurs) can, as regards the change of ô to
?, be supported only by the very doubtful analogies of Ps 62:4 (see § 52 q) and Ps 101:5 Qerê
(see § 55 b), while the view that it is Pi(cid:31)?l (??????=???????=??????) rests on no analogy whatever. It
would be more admissible to suppose that ?????? stands for ???????, Pu(cid:31)al (cf. ???????? for ????????, § 27
q); but no reason has been discovered for this departure from the natural punctuation ??????.

 Jb 20:26 we should simply emend ????????; the

????

?????

?

2. In the 1st pers. sing. imperfect, where two ?’s would ordinarily come together,
the second (which is radical) is regularly dropped (§ 23 f), as ?????1 (for ??????), &c.,

indicated by the form of the imperative ?????, the Arabic yakul and the Aramaic ??????,
as well as by the fact that ???????? and ???????? are found along with ?????? and ??????.
1 1 The regularity of this orthography indicates that the contraction of ??? to â in this
1st pers. occurred at a time when in the 3rd and 2nd persons the ? was still audible as
a consonant (which accordingly was almost always retained in writing). Nöldeke

and even plene ???????? Neh 2:7, &c., ???????? Ps 42:10. In the other cases, also, where the
? is ordinarily regarded as quiescing in ô or ê, it is only retained orthographically, and
on etymological grounds. Hence the possibility of its being dropped in the following
cases:—

Always in the contracted forms of ????, as ????? for ?????? Ps 104:29;

????

 2 S 6:1 (but for

????

????(cid:31)????  1 S 18:29 (for

???????Jb 27:19 read ??????=????? with the LXX); cf. also in the 1st pers. Mi 4:6 and ????????? 1 S
15:6, which is apparently (from the Metheg with the i), intended for an imperfect Hiph(cid:31)??l:
instead of it, however, read, with the Mantua edition, ????????? (with ??, according to § 60 f). But
????????? Ex 5:7 (for ?????),
), and ???? Jb 27:19 (see above) are due to
a mistake, since all three forms must be derived from the stem ?????. Furthermore,

§ 69. Verbs ???. First Class, or Verbs originally ???, e.g. ? ???? to dwell.

Brockelmann, Semit. Sprachwiss., p. 141 f.; Grundriss, p. 596 ff.

Verbs which at present begin with Yôdh when without preformatives are divided
into two classes according to their origin and consequent inflexion: (a) Verbs which
(as still in Arabic and Ethiopic) originally began with W?w, e.g. ????? to give birth to,
Arab. and Eth. w?l?d?. In consequence of a phonetic change which prevails also with
few exceptions in the noun, this W?w in Hebrew and Aramaic always becomes a
Yôdh, at least when it is the initial consonant; but after preformatives it either
reappears, or is again changed into Yôdh, or, lastly, is altogether elided; (b) Verbs
which (as in Arabic) originally began with Yôdh (called Verba cum Iod originario, see
§ 70). A few verbs again (some with original Yôdh, and some with original W?w)

(ZDMG. xxxii. 593) infers this from the fact that also in Arabic the 3rd and 2nd
persons are still written y?k?l?, t?k?l?, but the 1st pers. âk?l?, not ?k?l?.

form a special class, which in certain forms assimilates the W?w or Yâdh to the
following consonant on the analogy of the Nûn in verbs ??? (see § 71).

With regard to verbs ??? (i.e. ??? with original W?w) it is to be noticed that—

1. In the imperfect, imperative and infinitive construct Qal there is a twofold
inflexion, according as the W?w is wholly rejected or only changed into Yôdh. The
complete rejection (or elision) takes place regularly in eight verbs (see h) in the
following manner:

A. Imperfect ? ????, ????? with an unchangeable1 ?ere in the first syllable and original ??

in the second, which in the tone-syllable (according to § 27 c) becomes ? (thus ?????,
?????,
?????).

, see x), or, under the influence of a guttural, with ? in the second (?????, ?????,

;?????

 ??????

The tone-long ? of the second syllable is of course liable to be shortened or to

become Šewâ, e.g.
???????, &c., but is lengthened to Qame? in pause (

?????? ?? , ?? ?????, &c.; in the same way ? becomes Šewâ in such cases as

??????? ) and before suffixes (????????).

B. Imperative ? ?? with aphaeresis of the W?w and with tone-long ?, from ??, as in

the imperfect.

C. Infinitive

??????  from original šibh, by addition of the feminine ending (?)

lengthened to a segholate form; as in verbs ??? (cf. § 66 b) this lengthening affords a
certain compensation for loss of the initial consonant.

Rem. Since the infinitives ?????, ????? (see below, m) point to a ground-form di(cid:31)at, lidat, we

must, with Philippi (ZDMG. xxxii. 42) and Barth (ibid. xli. 606), assign to
ground-form šibt (which, therefore, reappears in ????? ??, &c.); the apparent ground-form šabt
rests upon the law that the ?? of the stem-syllable is changed into a whenever the syllable
becomes doubly closed by the addition of the vowelless feminine ending.

?????? , &c., the

In more than half the number of verbs ??? the original W?w in the above-
mentioned forms gives place to Yôdh, which, unless it suffers aphaeresis (see f),
appears:—

in the imperatives ?????, ????? and infinitives ?????, ?????, as a strong consonant, but

in the imperfect ??????, properly yiyr?š, merges with the preceding ?? into ??.

1 1 The e of the first syllable is really ê, not tone-long ?, since it is retained not merely
before the tone, and in the counter-tone (e.g. ?????????? Ho 14:10), but also in ????????? Ex
33:13, 17. It is no objection to this view that the scriptio plena of this ê occurs (with
the exception of ?????? Ps 72:14, elsewhere pointed ??????) only in Mi 1:8 and Ez 35:9
Keth.; in Ps 138:6 the Masora prefers to point ???????.—Of the various explanations of the
ê the most satisfactory is that of Philippi (ZDMG. xl. p. 653) that an original y?l?(cid:31)d,
for example (see above), became yilid by assimilation of the vowel of the first syllable
to that of the second; this then became yêl?d instead of y?l?d, in an attempt to raise the
word again in this way (by writing ê instead of ?) to a triliteral form.

In the second syllable imperfects of this form regularly have ?.

(a) That the latter forms are derived from verbs with an original W?w (not Yôdh) is shown

partly by the inflexion of these verbs in Niph(cid:31)al, Hiph(cid:31)??l, and Hoph(cid:31)al (where the original
W?w reappears throughout), and partly by the Arabic, in which verbs ??? likewise exhibit a
twofold formation; cf. w?l?d?, imperf. y?l??du, with elision of the W?w, and w????l?, yau?alu,
with retention of the W?w.

(b) Sometimes both forms, the weaker and the stronger, occur in the same verb; cf. ??? 2 K

4:41 and ????? pour, Ez 24:3 (cf. ??????? 1 K 18:34 and the infin.
possession, Dt 1:21, 1 K 21:15 (but cf. s), ??? (in pause for ???) Dt 2:24, 31; plur. ???? Dt 1:8,
9:23, but also, with ? ?? paragogic,
10:16 it shall be kindled; ???????? it was precious, 1 S 18:30 and ????? Ps 49:9 (cf. ?????? Ps 72:14).—
The form ????????? Gn 30:39, for ?????????, beside

?????? ??  Dt 33:23. In the imperfect ?????? Dt 32:22 and ????? Is

 verse 38, is remarkable; cf. § 47 k.

??????  Ex 38:27); ??? take

??????

??????

(c) On ??? Ju 19:11 for

?????  and ??? Jer 42:10 for the infinitive absolute ?????, cf. § 19 i.—
But ????? Ju 5:13 (twice) is not intended by the Masora either as perfect (for ?????, which really
should be restored) or as imperative of ?????, but as an apocopated imperfect Pi(cid:31)?l from ?????
(=???????) to have dominion.

(d) The eight verbs,1 of which the initial consonant in the above-mentioned forms always

suffers elision or aphaeresis, are ????? to bring forth, ????? to go forth, ? ???? to sit, to dwell, ????? to
descend, also ?????? to go (cf. below, x); and with ? in the second syllable of the imperfect, ????? to
know, ????? to be united, ????? to be dislocated. Examples of the other formation ( ?????? , &c.) are ?????
to be wearied, ????? to counsel, ? ???? to sleep, ????? (imperfect ??????, imperative ?????) to fear.

2. The original W?w is retained as a firm consonant: (a) in the infinitive,

imperative, and imperfect Niph(cid:31)al, being protected by the strengthening, e.g. ? ??????,
? ??????, which are consequently strong forms like ???????, ???????; (b) in the Hithpa(cid:31)el of
some verbs, e.g. ????????? from ?????, ????????? from ?????, ????????? from ?????; otherwise a radical
W?w at the beginning of a word is now found only in a few nouns, e.g. ????? off spring
from ????? to bear. At the end of a syllable W?w with the homogeneous vowel ?
coalesces into ?; so throughout Hoph(cid:31)al, e.g. ? ???? for h?wšabh; but with a preceding
a the W?w is contracted into ô (?); so in the perfect and participle Niph(cid:31)al and
throughout Hiph(cid:31)??l, e.g. ? ???? from an original n?wš?bh, ?? ???? from an original
h?wš??bh.

The first radical always appears as Yôdh in the perfect and participle Qal, ? ????,
&c., ? ???, ?????, even when ?? precedes, e.g. ? ?????? (but ????? ??????, according to § 24 b), also
throughout Pi(cid:31)?l and Pu(cid:31)al, e.g. ????? to wait, ????? to be born, and in the imperfect and
participle ???????, ??????? known (from ?????), and, as a rule, also in Hithpa(cid:31)el, e.g. ?????????,
?????????, ????????? (as against ?????????, &c., with W?w).

1 1 A ninth ????? to add, is also to be included. In the Mêša(cid:31)-inscription, l. 21, the
infinitive is written ???? (cf. ?????, l. 29); hence read in Is 30:1 (Nu 32:14, Dt 29:18)
??(cid:31)???
 for ?????. The 2nd plur. masc. imperative ???? Is 29:1, Jer 7:21 corresponds to
?? ??; thus in proof of a supposed ????? addere, there remains only ?????? Dt 32:23, for
which, according to 2 S 12:8, read

.
????(cid:31)???

The beginner may recognize verbs ??? in the imperfect Qal partly by the ?ere under the

preformatives; in Niph(cid:31)al and Hiph(cid:31)??l by the W?w (?, ?) before the second radical. (The
defective writing, as in ??????, is rare.) Verbs ??? have forms like
?????? , in common
with verbs ???. Similarly Hoph(cid:31)al has the same form as in verbs ??? and ???.

the afformative ??? (
 &c.), is in accordance with the law mentioned above (under c), by
which ? takes the place of ? in a doubly closed syllable. Forms with ? in the second syllable
shorten the ? to Seghôl, when the tone is drawn back (before a tone-syllable or after w?w
consecutive), e.g. ????? ????? Gn 44:33;
Mil(cid:31)el-tone, in
either of the form ? ?????? Ru 4:1 or

1 1 ????? ???? Ps 23:6 can hardly be intended for an infin. with suffix from ? ????, but rather

modern criticism of the Pentateuch. The same document also has ????? to give, for ???;
?????? to go, for
; and ???? to make, for ?????. See Dillmann, Die BB. Num., Deut.,
Jos., p. 618.

??(cid:31)???

The imperfect of the form ?????? is frequently (especially before afformatives) written
defectively, in which case the ?? can always be recognized as a long vowel by the Metheg (see
§ 16 f), e.g. ??????? Is 40:30, ??????? Is 65:23; and so always ??????? they fear, as distinguished from
 Gn 50:26, 24:33 Keth, and ??????? Ex 30:32, see §
?????? they see (imperf. Qal of ????).—On
73 f.

?????? ???

From ????? to prevail, to be able, the imperfect Qal is ?????, which can only have arisen
through a depression of the vowel from ????? (ground-form yaukhal=yawkhal), to distinguish it,
according to Qim?i, from ?????, just as, according to § 47 b, ??????? is differentiated from ???????.
Cf. the Arabic yauru(cid:31)u (yôru(cid:31)u) from waru(cid:31)a, yau?alu (yô?alu) from wa?ila, as also the
vulgar Arabic (among towns-people) yû?al, &c., from wa?ala. Others regard ????? as an
imperfect Hoph(cid:31)al (he is enabled=he can), always used instead of the imperfect Qal; cf.,
however, § 53 u.—???????? occurs in Jer 3:5 as 2nd sing. fem. for ??????????, according to König
because the 2nd fem. had been sufficiently indicated previously.—Further ????? or ????? is to be
regarded with M. Lambert (REJ. xxxvii, no. 73) as impf. Qal (not Hiph(cid:31)il) of ????? to throw,
shoot (the supposed impf. Qal ???????? Nu 21:30 is critically very doubtful). This is shown
especially by the passages in which the impf. ????? is immediately preceded by the imperat.
Qal (2 K 13:17) or infin. Qal (Ps 64:5), or is followed by the participle Qal (2 Ch 35:23; but
in 2 S 11:24 by the participle Hiph(cid:31)il).

4. The attenuation of ? to ?? in the perfect (in a toneless, closed syllable) which is

discussed in § 44 d (cf. § 64 f) occurs in verbs ??? in a few forms of ????? Nu 11:12, Jer 2:27, Ps
2:7, &c. (always after ??), as well as of ?????, e.g. ??? ????????, &c., Dt 4:1, 8:1, 17:14, 19:1, 26:1,
31:3 (always after ??? for ????). In both cases the attenuation might be explained from the
tendency to assimilate the vowels, especially if the initial ?? was pronounced, as in Syriac, like
i (§ 47 b). In the case of ?????, however, a secondary form ????? (cf. § 44 d) is probably to be
assumed, since in Arabic also the verb is w?r????. The forms  ???????
 Ez 36:12 and  ???????
????
69:36, &c., are most simply explained from the return of this ??.

 Ps

????

5. As an exception, the imperfect Niph(cid:31)al sometimes has a ? instead of the ?, e.g.

??????????

and he stayed, Gn 8:12 (unless the Pi(cid:31)?l or ???????, as in ver. 10, is to be read), cf. Ex 19:13; 1 S
13:8 Keth??bh.—The first person always has the form ? ??????, not ? ??????, cf. § 51 p.—In the
participle the plural ????? (from ?????, with depression of ô to û, cf. § 27 n) is found in Zp 3:18; cf.
La 1:4. While in these cases some doubt may be felt as to the correctness of the Masoretic
pointing, much more is this so in the perfect ?????? nulledhû, 1 Ch 3:5, 20:8, for ??????? which
appears to be required by the w?w in the initial syllable.

6. In the imperfect Pi(cid:31)?l elision of the first radical (?) sometimes takes place after w?w
consec. (as in the case of ?, § 68 k), e.g. ??????? for ????????? and he has grieved, La 3:33, ?????? for ????????
and they have cast, verse 53, from ???, which may also be a true verb ??? (on the other hand,
in ????? ???? they have east lots, Jo 4:3, Ob 11, Na 3:10, a perfect Qal of ????? is required by the
????  according to § 67 a,
context; but as this, being a transitive perfect, ought to have the form
???
 and he

perhaps we should read ????). So from a verb ???, of the second class,
????????
made it dry, Na 1:4; cf. ?????????? 2 Ch 32:30 Qerê (the Keth. points either to Pi(cid:31)?l ???????????? or

?????

also ????? as jussive, Jb 40:32 (usual jussive in pause ? ????, &c., which occurs even without the

to be read for
???
); imperfect ???????, but in the 1st sing. of the imperfect consecutive always ????????? Lv
26:13, Am 2:10, &c. Rarely, and almost exclusively late or in poetry, the regular inflexions of
?????? are also found: imperf. ????????? (Ps 58:9, &c.; but ????????? Ex 9:23, Ps 73:9; cf. § 64 a and h);
????????? Jb 16:22, also Mêša(cid:31) inscription, line 14, ????; infin. ?????? (Ex 3:19, Nu 22:13 f.16, 1
Ec 6:8, 9); imperative plur. ?????? Jer 51:50. On the other hand, the perfect Qal is always ??????,
participle ??????, infinitive absolute ??????, Niph(cid:31)al ?????????, Pi(cid:31)?l ??????, Hithpa(cid:31)?l ??????????, so that a
? never arrears unmistakably as the first radical. The usual explanation of the above forms is
nevertheless based on a supposed obsolete ??????. It is, however, more correct to regard the
apparent ??? forms of ??? with Praetorius (ZAW. ii. 310 ff.) as originating with the Hiph(cid:31)îl, of
which the ground-form hahl??kh became hâl??kh, and this again, on the analogy of the imperfect
Qal of verbs ???, hôl??kh. This hôl??kh being referred to a supposed haul??kh (properly hawl??kh)
gave rise to new formations after the manner of verbs ???.

Verbs properly ??? differ from verbs ??? in the following points:

1. In Qal the initial Yôdh never suffers aphaeresis or elision; hence the infinitive
has the form ????, 2 the imperfect ??????, ??????, ??????. (in pause ??????.), also written ?????, &c.;

Rem. 1. The only verbs of this kind are: ????? to be good (only in the imperfect Qal and in

Hiph(cid:31)??l; in the perfect Qal ???, a verb ???, is used instead), ????? to suck, ????? to awake, ????? to

of Yôdh and He, arising from the unsyncopated forms ?????????, &c. (cf. Is 52:5). It is, perhaps,
more correct to suppose that the regular forms (???????, ???????) were originally intended, but that
in the later pronunciation the syllable was broken up in order to restore artificially the
preformative which had become merged in the first radical.

§ 71. Verbs ???. Third Class, or Verbs with Yôdh assimilated.

In some verbs ???, the Yôdh (or the original W?w) does not quiesce in the

preceding vowel, but is regarded as a full consonant, and, like Nûn, 1 is assimilated to
the following consonant. These forms, therefore, belong properly to the class of
strong verbs. Assimilation invariably takes place in ????? (prop. ???) to spread under;
Hiph(cid:31)??l ???????, Hoph(cid:31)al ?????; ????? to burn, imperfect ?????, Niph(cid:31)al ?????, Hiph(cid:31)??l ?????? (in

§ 72. Verbs ??? (vulgo ???), e.g. ??? to rise up. Paradigm M.

Brockelmann, Semit. Sprachwiss., p. 144 ff.; Grundriss, p. 605 ff.

1. According to § 67 a a large number of monosyllabic stems were brought into

agreement with the triliteral form by a strengthening, or repetition, of the second
radical, i.e. of the consonantal element in the stem. In another large class of stems the
same object has been attained by strengthening the vocalic element. The ground-form
used for these verbs is not, as in other cases (§ 39 a), the 3rd sing. mast. perfect, but
always the infinitive construct form (§ 39 b), the û of which is characteristic also of
the imperative and of the imperfect indicative Qal. These stems are consequently
termed verbs ??? or more correctly (see below) ???.1

??(cid:31)???

 death, compared with ??? to die. Hence in explaining the verbal

Jabl. Jabl. = Biblia Hebraica ex recensione D. E. Jablonski, Berolini, 1699.
1 1 The term ??? was consequent on the view that the W?w (or ? in the case of verbs
???) in these stems was originally consonantal. This view seemed especially to be
supported by the return of the W?w in Pi(cid:31)?l (?????, the ? usually passing into ? as in ?????,
cf. Arabic qáww?m?), and by certain forms of the absolute state of the nouns of such
stems, e.g.
forms a supposed stem qawam (in verbs ??? e.g. šayat) was always assumed, and ?????
was referred to an original yaqw?m, the infinitive absolute ??? to original qawôm, the
participle passive ??? to original qawûm. It must, however, be admitted: (1) that forms
like ?????, ???? (see m) are only to be found in the latest books, and are hence evidently
secondary as compared with the pure Hebrew forms ?????, &c.; (2) that to refer the
verbal forms invariably to the stem ?????, leads in many cases to phonetic combinations
which are essentially improbable, whereas the assumption of original middle-vowel
stems renders a simple and natural explanation almost always possible. These ???
stems are therefore to be rigidly distinguished from the real ??? stems of the strong
forms, such as ?????, ?????, &c. (see below, gg).—As early as the eleventh century the
right view with regard to ?? stems was taken by Samuel Hannagîd (cf. Bacher, Leben
und Werke des AbulwaléÆd, p. 16); recently by Böttcher (Lehrbuch, § 1112), and
(also as to ??? stems) especially by Müller, Stade, and Wellhausen (see above, § 67 a,
note). On the other hand, the old view of ? and ? as consonants has been recently
revived by Philippi, Barth, M. Lambert, and especially Brockelmann (op. cit.).

2. As in the case of verbs ???, the monosyllabic stem of verbs ??? generally takes

the vowel which would have been required in the second syllable of the ordinary
strong form, or which belonged to the ground-form, since this is essentially
characteristic of the verbal form (§ 43 b; § 67 b). However, it is to be remarked: (a)
that the vowel, short in itself, becomes of necessity long in an open syllable as well as
in a tone-bearing closed ultima (except in Hoph(cid:31)al, see d), e.g. 3rd sing. mast. perf.
??????? , &c.1; (b) that in the forms as
???, fem.
we now have them the lengthening of the original short vowel sometimes takes place
irregularly. Cf. f.

????? , but in a closed penultima

?????? , plur.

Intransitive verbs middle e in the perfect Qal have the form ??? he is dead; verbs
middle o have the form ??? he shone, ?? he was ashamed, ??? he was good.2 Cf. n–r.

3. In the imperfect Qal, perfect Niph(cid:31)al, and throughout Hiph(cid:31)??l and Hoph(cid:31)al
the short vowel of the preformatives in an open syllable before the tone is changed
into the corresponding tone-long vowel. In Qal and Niph(cid:31)al the original ? is the basis
of the form and not the ?? attenuated from ? (§ 67 h; but cf. also h below, on ?????),
hence ?????, for y?qûm; ????? for n?qôm; on the other hand, in the perfect Hiph(cid:31)??l ??????
for h??q??m; participle ?????? (on the ?ere cf. z); perfect Hoph(cid:31)al ????? for h?qam.

A vowel thus lengthened before the tone is naturally changeable and becomes vocal Šewâ

when the tone is moved forward, e.g.
Qal with Nûn paragogic;  ?????
in ?????????? Jer 2:11 (beside ?????? in the same verse) should, with König, be emended to ????????;
the incorrect repetition of the interrogative necessarily led to the pointing of the form as
perfect instead of imperfect.—But in Hoph(cid:31)al the û is retained throughout as an
unchangeable vowel, when it has been introduced by an abnormal lengthening for the tone-
long ? (as in the Hoph(cid:31)al of verbs ???).

4. The cases of unusual vowel lengthening mentioned in b are: imperfect Qal ?????

(also in Arabic y?qûmu), but jussive with normal lengthening (§ 48 g), ?????, with
retraction of the tone

lengthening of the ? in the 2nd plur. fem.

2 2 According to Stade (Grammatik, § 385 e and f) the e in ??? is of the nature of a
diphthong (from ai, which arose from the union of the vowel ?(cid:31), the sign of the
intransitive, with the ? of the root), and likewise the o in ???, &c. (from au). But ô
(from au) could not, by § 26 p, remain in a closed penultima ( (cid:31)??? ?? , &c.); consequently
the o of these forms can only be tone-long, i.e. due to lengthening of an original ?,
and similarly the ? of ??? to lengthening of an original ?(cid:31). This is confirmed by the
fact that the ? in ?? ???,  (cid:31)?
(the instances are 11 to 2), written defectively. Forms like  (cid:31)?? ??? ,  (cid:31)???? ,  (cid:31)???? , &c., are
therefore due to orthographic licence.

The following forms require special consideration: the participle Qal ??? is to be
traced to the ground-form with â unobscured, Arab. qât??l, § 9 q, and § 50 b. On this
analogy the form would be qâ??m,1 which after absorption of the ?? became ???, owing to
the predominating character of the â. The unchangeableness of the â (plur. ??????,
constr. ?????, &c.) favours this explanation.

5. In the perfect Niph(cid:31)al and Hiph(cid:31)??l a ? is inserted before the afformatives
beginning with a consonant in the 1st and 2nd persons, and ? ?? regularly (but see
Rem.) in the imperfect Qal, sometimes also in the imperfect Hiph(cid:31)??l (as in
7:30, cf.
note) these separating vowels serve as an artificial opening of the preceding syllable,
in order to preserve the long vowel; in the perfect Hiph(cid:31)??l, however, before the ?,
instead of the ?? an ? is somewhat often found2 (as a normal lengthening of the original
??), especially after w?w consecutive, Dt 4:39, 30:1, as well as before the afformatives
??? and ??? or before suffixes, Dt 22:2, 1 S 6:8, 1 K 8:34, Ez 34:4. For in all these cases
the tone is removed from the ? to the following syllable, and this forward movement
of the tone produces at the same time a weakening of the ?? to ?; thus ??????,

8. The verbs ??? are primarily related to the verbs ??? (§ 67), which were also originally
biliteral, so that it is especially necessary in analysing them to pay attention to the differences
between the inflexion of the two classes. Several forms are exactly the same in both, e.g.
imperfect Qal and Hiph(cid:31)??l with w?w consecutive, the whole of Hoph(cid:31)al, the Pi(cid:31)l?l of verbs
???, and the Pô(cid:31)?l of verbs ???; see § 67 z. Owing to this close relation, verbs ??? sometimes
have forms which follow the analogy of verbs ???, e.g. perfect Qal ??? he has despised (from
???, as if from ?????) Zc 4:10; perfect Niph(cid:31)al ?????? Jer 48:11 (for ????? from ???, as if from ?????).
The same explanation equally applies to ???????? Jb 10:1 for
and
???
????? Mi 2:6; Hiph(cid:31)??l perfect ????? Is 18:5 for ????? (cf. § 29 q), which is for ?????? from ???. On the
other hand the imperfects ????? Ez 48:14 (unless it be intended for ?????, cf. Ps 15:4) and ?????? Hb
2:3, are to be regarded according to § 109 i, simply as rhythmically shortened forms of ??????
and ???????.

act wickedly; ????? to bend, Hithpa(cid:31)?l ????????? to bend oneself; and this is especially the case
with verbs which are at the same time ???, e.g. ?????, Pi(cid:31)?l ????? to command, ????? to wait, ????? to
drink, Pi(cid:31)?l ????? (on

 Is 16:9, see § 75 dd) and Hiph(cid:31)??l ??????? to give to drink, &c.

§ 73. Verbs middle i (vulgo ???), e.g. ???? to discern. Paradigm N.

1. These verbs agree, as regards their structure, exactly with verbs ???, and in

contrast to them may be termed ???, or more correctly, (cid:31)ayin-?? verbs, from the
characteristic vowel of the impf., imper., and infin. constr. This distinction is justified
in so far as it refers to a difference in the pronunciation of the imperfect and its
kindred forms, the imperative and infin. constr.—the ??? verbs having û lengthened
from original ? and ??? having ?? lengthened from original ??. In other respects verbs ???
simply belong to the class of really monosyllabic stems, which, by a strengthening of
their vocalic element, have been assimilated to the triliteral form1 (§ 67 a). In the
perfect Qal the monosyllabic stem, as in ???, has ? lengthened from ?, thus: ? ?? he has
set; infinitive ?? ??, infinitive absolute ???, imperative ?? ??, imperfect ?? ????, jussive ? ????
(§ 48 g), imperfect consecutive
?????? ?? .—The perfect Qal of some verbs used to be
treated as having a double set of forms, a regular series, and others like Hiph(cid:31)??l

1 1 As the passive of this Hiph(cid:31)?(cid:31)l we should expect the Hoph(cid:31)al ?????, which is, no
doubt, to be read for ????? in La 5:5.
1 1 That verbs ??? and ??? are developed from biliteral roots at a period before the
differentiation of the Semitic languages is admitted even by Nöldeke (Beiträge zur
sem. Sprachwiss., Strassburg, 1904, p. 34 ff.), although he contests the view that
 are to be referred to Hiph(cid:31)?(cid:31)l with the preformative dropped.

doubt be taken as forms middle ? (properly ??), the ?? of which has been lengthened to ??
(like the ? lengthened to ? in the imperfect Qal of ???). It is more probable, however,
that they are really shortened forms of Hiph(cid:31)??l. This is supported by the fact that,
especially in the case of ????, the shortened forms are few and probably all late, while
the corresponding unshortened forms with the same meaning are very numerous, e.g.
perfect ?????? (but ???? only in Dn 10:1), ???????????, infinitive ?????? (but infin. abs. ???? only in
Pr 23:1), imperative ????? (only in Dn 9:23 ????? immediately before ???????, also

2. The above-mentioned Hiph(cid:31)??l-forms might equally well be derived from verbs

(ground-form nab?n), Pôl?l ?????, and Hithpôl?l ?????????. The very close relation existing

?????? ) to
spend the night, ????? occurs six times as infinitive construct, ?????? only in Gn 24:23; but
the imperative is always ????, &c.—Of verbs ??? the most common are ?? ?? to set, ???? to
strive, ???? to judge, ?? ?? to rejoice; cf. also perfect ??? (middle Yôdh in Arabic) to
comprehend, to measure, Is 40:12; ???? (as in Arabic and Syriac) to rush upon, and the
denominative perfect ??? (from

from the imperfects Qal ??????, ?? ????, &c., which were wrongly regarded as imperfects

the reading of the Oriental schools (see p. 38, note 2): the Keth??bh has ???? ??. A passive of Qal

Hiph(cid:31)??l of ???? is the doubtful
explanation of ????, &c., as a passive of Qal arising from yiysam, &c. = yuysam (so Barth,

4. In verbs ??? the ? always retains its censonantal value; these stems are, therefore, to be

regarded as verbs middle Guttural (§ 64). An exception is ?????? Ec 12:5 if it be imperfect
Hiph(cid:31)??l of ??? (for ???????); but if the form has really been correctly transmitted, it should rather
be referred to ?????, and regarded as incorrectly written for ?????. On ????? (from ????????), which was
formerly treated here as ???, see now § 75 x.

§ 74. Verbs ???, e.g. ????? to find. Paradigm O.

The ? in these verbs, as in verbs ???, is treated in some cases as a consonant, i.e.
as a guttural, in others as having no consonantal value (as a quiescent or vowel letter),
viz.:

1. In those forms which terminate with the ?, the final syllable always has the
regular vowels, if long, e.g. ?????, ?????, ?????, ????????, i.e. the ? simply quiesces in the

2 2 The most important of these differences are, (a) those between the Orientals, i. e.
the scholars of the Babylonian Schools, and the Occidentals, i. e. the scholars of
Palestine (Tiberias, &c.); cf. Ginsburg, Introd., p. 197 ff.; (b) amongst the
Occidentals, between Ben-Naphtali and Ben-Asher, who flourished in the first half of
the tenth century at Tiberias; cf. Ginsburg, Introd., p. 241 ff. Both sets of variants are
given by Baer in the appendices to his critical editions. Our printed editions present
uniformly the text of Ben-Asher, with the exception of a few isolated readings of Ben-
Naphtali, and of numerous later corruptions.

long vowel, without the latter suffering any change whatever. It is just possible that
after the altogether heterogeneous vowel û the ? may originally have preserved a
certain consonantal value. On the other band, if the final ? quiesces in a preceding ?
(as in the perfect, imperfect, and imperative Qal, in the perfect Niph(cid:31)al, and in Pu(cid:31)al
and Hoph(cid:31)al) this ? is necessarily lengthened to ?, by § 27 g, as standing in an open
syllable; e.g. ?????, ???????, &c.

The imperfect and imperative Qal invariably have ? in the final syllable, on the analogy
of verbs tertiae gutturalis; cf., however, § 76 e.—In the imperfect Hithpa(cid:31)?l ? occurs in the
final syllable not only (according to § 54 k) in the principal pause (Nu 31:23), or immediately
before it (Jb 10:16), or with the lesser disjunctives (Lv 21:1, 4, Nu 19:13, 20), but even out of
pause with Merekha, Nu 6:7, and even before Maqqeph in Nu 19:12.

2. When ? stands at the end of a syllable before an afformative beginning with a
consonant (?, ? ), it likewise quiesces with the preceding vowel; thus in the perfect Qal
(and Hoph(cid:31)al, see below) quiescing with ? it regularly becomes Qume? (

(a) The Seghôl of these forms of the imperfect and imperative might be considered as a
modification, and at the same time a lengthening of an original ? (see § 8 a). In the same way
the ? of the perfect forms in Pi(cid:31)?l, Hithpa(cid:31)?l, and Hiph(cid:31)??l might be traced to an original ??
(as in other cases the ? and ?? in the final syllable of the 3rd sing. muse. perfect of these
conjugations), although this ?? may have only been attenuated from an original ?. According to
another, and probably the correct explanation, however, both the ?ere and the Seghôl are due
to the analogy of verbs ??? (§ 75 f) in consequence of the close relation between the two
classes, cf. § 75 nn.—No form of this kind occurs in Pu(cid:31)al; in the perfect Hoph(cid:31)al only the
2nd masc. sing.

(b) Before suffixes attached by a connecting vowel (e.g.

3. When ? begins a syllable (consequently before afformatives which consist of or
begin with a vowel, as well as before suffixes) it is necessarily a firm consonant, and
the form then follows the analogy of the strong verb, e.g. ??????? m??e(cid:31)?, ???????, &c.

5. In the jussive, imperfect consecutive, and imperative Hiph(cid:31)??l a number of cases occur

Dt 4:20, 2 K 11:12, Ps 78:16, 105:43; imperative ?????? Jer 17:18; ?????? Is 43:8 (in both cases
before ?). If the tradition be correct (which at least in the defectively written forms appears
very doubtful) the retention of the ?? is to be attributed to the open syllable; while in the closed
syllable of the 3rd sing. masc. and fem., and the 2nd sing. masc. after ? consecutive, the ?? is
always reduced to ?. In the examples before ? considerations of euphony may also have had
some influence (cf. § 75 hh).—In Ez 40:3, Baer reads with the Western school ????????, while the
Orientals read in the Keth??bh ?????, and in the Qerê ???????.

§ 75. Verbs ???, e.g. ????? to reveal. Paradigm P.

Brockelmann, Semit. Sprachwiss., p. 149 ff.; Grundriss, p. 618 ff.—G. R. Berry,
‘Original Waw in ??? verbs’ in AJSL. xx. 256 f.

These verbs, like the verbs ??? (§§ 69, 70), belong to two different classes, viz.

those originally ??? and those originally ???,1 which in Arabic, and even more in
Ethiopic, are still clearly distinguished. In Hebrew, instead of the original ? or ? at the
end of the word, a ? always appears (except in the ptcp. pass. Qal) as a purely
orthographic indication of a final vowel (§ 23 k); hence both classes are called ???,
e.g. ????? for ????? he has revealed; ??? ?? for ??? ?? he has rested. By far the greater number
of these verbs are, however, treated as originally ???; only isolated forms occur of
verbs ???.

??? ?? to be at rest may be recognized as originally ???, in the forms in which the W?w

appears as a strong consonant, cf. 1st sing. perfect Qal
?????
the derivative ????? ?? rest; on the other hand the imperfect is
???) to answer, and ????? (Arab. ???)2 to be afflicted, are to be seen two verbs originally distinct,
which have been assimilated in Hebrew (see the Lexicon, s. v. ?????).

 Jb 3:26, the participle ??? ?? and
. (with Yôdh). In ????? (Arab.
?? ????

?? ???
???

Of quite a different class are those verbs of which the third radical is a consonantal ?
(distinguished by Mapp??q). These are inflected throughout like verbs tertiae gutturalis. Cf.
§65 note on the heading.

The grammatical structure of verbs ??? (see Paradigm P) is based on the following

laws:—

1. In all forms in which the original Yôdh or W?w would stand at the end of the
word, it is dropped (cf. § 24 g) and ? takes its place as an orthographic indication of
the preceding long vowel. Such an indication would have been indispensable, on
practical grounds, in the still unvocalized consonantal text. But even after the addition
of the vowel signs, the orthographic rule remained, with insignificant exceptions (see
§ 8 k, and ? in
verbs ??? the ? which is here employed as a vowel letter is preceded by the same
vowel in the same part of the verb throughout all the conjugations. Thus the endings
are—

, &c.), that a final vowel must be indicated by a vowel letter. In

? ?? in all perfects, ?????, ???????, ?????, &c.

? ?? in all imperfects and participles, ???????, ?????, &c.

? ?? in all imperatives, ?????, ?????, &c.

AJSL. AJSL. = American Journal of Semitic Languages.
1 1 According to Wellheusen, ‘Ueber einige Arten schwacher Verbs‘ in his Skizzen,
vi. p. 255 ff., the ??? verbs, apart from some true ??? and some probable ???, are to be
regarded as originally biliteral. To compensate for their arrested development they
lengthened the vowel after the 2nd radical, as the ??? verbs did after the 1st radical.
But although there is much to be said for this view, it fails to explain pausal forms like
????(cid:31)???
2 2 In the Mêša(cid:31) inscription, line 5, ????? and he oppressed occurs as 3rd sing. masc.
imperfect Pi(cid:31)?l, and in line 6, ???? I will oppress as 1st sing.

 (see u). It seems impossible that these should all be late formations.

? ?? in the infinitive absolute (?????, &c.), except in Hiph(cid:31)??l, Hoph(cid:31)al, and

generally also Pi?l, see aa and ff.

The participle passive Qal alone forms an exception, the original ? (or ?, see v)

reappearing at the end, ?????; and so also some derived nouns (§ 84a c, ?, &c.).

The infinitive construct always has the ending ?? (with ? feminine); Qal ?????,

Pi(cid:31)?l ?????, &c.; for exceptions, see n and y.

These forms may be explained as follows:—in the perfect Qal ????? stands, according to the

above, for (?)????, and, similarly, in Niph(cid:31)al, Pu(cid:31)al, and Hoph(cid:31)al. The Pi(cid:31)?l and Hithpa(cid:31)?l
may be based on the forms ?????, ????????? (§ 52 l; and § 54 k), and Hiph(cid:31)??l on the form ???????, on
the analogy of the ? in the second syllable of the Arabic (cid:31)áqt?l? (§ 53 a). Perhaps, however,
the final? of these conjugations simply follows the analogy of the other conjugations.

The explanation of the final tone-bearing ? ?? of the imperfect is still a matter of dispute.
As to the various treatments of it, see Barth, Nominalbildung, i. p. xxx ff, with § 136, Rem.,
and ZDMG. xliv. 695 f., against Philippi’s objections in the Zeitschrift für Völkerpsychologie,
1890, p. 356 f.; also ZDMG. lvi. 244, where Barth appeals to the rule that, in the period before
the differentiation of the North Semitic dialects, final iy becomes ?? (constr. ? ??), not ??; M.
Lambert, Journ. Asiat. 1893, p. 285; Prätorius, ZDMG. lv. 365. The most probable
explanation now seems to be, first, that the uniform pronunciation of all imperfects and
participles with Seghôl in the last syllable merely follows the analogy of the impf. Qal, and
secondly, that the Seghôl of the impf. Qal does perhaps ultimately represent a contraction of
the original termination ? ?? (= ai), although elsewhere (e.g. in the imperative of ???) ai is
usually contracted to ê.

2. When the original Yôdh stands at the end of the syllable before an afformative

beginning with a consonant (?, ? ) there arises (a) in the perfects, primarily the
diphthong ai (? ??). In the middle of the word this ought always to be contracted to ê ( ??
?), but this ê is only found consistently in the passive conjugations, whilst regularly in
Qal, and frequently in the other active and reflexive conjugations (especially in
Pi(cid:31)?l), it appears as ?? (cf. x, z, ee). This ??, however, in the perf. Qal is not to be
explained as a weakening of an original ê, but as the original vowel of the intransitive
form. It then became usual also in the transitive forms of Qal (and in some other
conjugations on this analogy), whereas e.g. in Syriac the two kinds of forms are still
carefully distinguished.—(b) In the imperfects and imperatives, ? ?? with the tone
always appears before the afformative ???. On the most probable explanation of this ? ??,
see above, e.

Summary. Accordingly before afformatives beginning with a consonant the

principal vowel is—

In the perfect Qal ??, e.g.

????? ;
???

In the perfects of the other active and reflexive conjugations, sometimes ê,
????? ;
?????

????
;
????????

????????

 and

 and

sometimes ??,

In the perfects passive always ê, e.g.

????????

;

In the imperfects and imperatives always ? ??, e.g.

?????????

,

???????????

.

The diphthongal forms have been systematically retained in Arabic and Ethiopic; only as

an exception and in the popular language is the diphthong contracted. In Aramaic the
contracted forms predominate, yet the Syriac, for example, has in Qal 2nd pers. sing. gelait
(but 1st pers. sing. ??????), and so too the Western Aramaic

????? , but also ???????.

??

3. Before the vocalic afformatives (?, ? ??, ? ??) the Yôdh is usually dropped

altogether, e.g. ???? (ground-form g?l?yû), ???????, participle fem. ?????, plur. masc. ??????;
yet the old full forms also not infrequently occur, especially in pause, see u. The
elision of the Yôdh takes place regularly before suffixes, e.g. ??????? (see ll).

4. In the 3rd sing. fem. perfect, the original feminine ending ? ?? was appended to
the stem; hence, after elision of the Yôdh, arose properly forms like ?????, with ?, in the
final syllable with the tone, This form, however, has been but rarely preserved (see
below, m). The analogy of the other forms had so much influence, that the common
ending ? ?? was added pleonastically to the ending ? ??. Before the ? ?? the vowel of the
ending ? ??, which thus loses the tone, becomes Šewâ, and thus there arise such forms
as ????????, ?????????, &c. (but in pause

???????? , &c.).

For similar cases see § 70 d; § 91 m.

5. Finally, a strongly-marked peculiarity of verbs ??? is the rejection of the ending

? ?? in forming the jussive and the imperfect consecutive. This shortening c curs in all
the conjugations, and sometimes also involves further changes in the vocalization (see
o, y, bb, gg). Similarly, in some conjugations a shortened imperative (cf. § 48 k) is
formed by apocope of the final ? ?? (see cc, gg).

6. The ordinary form of the imperfect with the ending ? ?? serves in verbs ??? to
express the cohortative also (§ 48 c); cf. Gn 1:26, 2:18, 2 Ch 25:17, &c. With a final  ??
 (with the ? retained, see below, u)
? there occur only: in Qal, ??? ???? Ps 119:117,
Ps 77:4; and in Hithpa(cid:31)?l

 Is 41:23 (with ?iph?a, therefore in lesser pause).

REMARKS.

On Qal.

1. The older form of the fem. of the 3rd sing. perf. ?????, mentioned above, under i (cf. § 74
g), is preserved in ? ???? (before ?) Lv 25:21 (cf. 2 K 9:37 Keth??bh)1; likewise in Hiph(cid:31)??l ???????

sing. fem. is also written ??? ??; thus in the textus receptus ????????? 2 S 14:2, and always in Baer’s
editions (since 1872), as in most other verbs; ??????? and ??????? Is 57:8; ??? ???? Jer 2:23, Ez 16:48,

6:12), &c., beside ?????. The form ??? ?? Is 22:13 (beside ?? ?? in the same verse) appears to
have been chosen on account of its similarity in sound to ??? ??; so in Is 42:20 Qerê and Ho
10:4, ???? (unless it is a substantive, oaths) and ?????; cf. also ????? Hb 3:13.—Conversely,
instead of the infinitive construct ????? such forms are occasionally found as ????? or ????, cf. ?????
Gn 48:11; ????? Pr 16:16; ???? Gn 50:20, Ps 101:3, also ???? Gn 31:28 (cf. Pr 31:4), and even
 Ex 18:18.2—The feminine form ???????? (for
with the suffix ?? the very remarkable form  ??????
?????) Ez 28:17, analogous to nouns like ???????? (cf. § 45 d), is strange, but ????? as infin. Ez 21:15

Nominalbildung, § 51 a, as infinitives absolute of the passive of Qal (see above, § 53 u), not
of Pô(cid:31)?l.—The 2nd sing. masc. imperative ???????? occurs in the principal pause in Pr 4:4 and
7:2; but probably these forms are simply to be attributed to a Masoretic school, which in
general marked the difference between certain forms by the use of é for ?, and conversely ?
for é; cf. the analogous examples in § 52 n, and especially § 75 hh, also Kautzsch, Grammatik

Pr 20:12, has also a feminine which retains the 3rd radical ?, viz. ???????? ( =?????) weeping, La

invariably (but König calls attention to its use as infinitive construct in Ez 21:20) as an
adverb, in the sense of much; in 2 S 14:11 the Qerê requires ??????? for the Keth??bh ????????, an
evident scribal error for ???????. Cf. Gn 41:49, 22:17, Dt 28:63; the pointing ??????? Jer 42:2
probably arises from regarding this form as a noun.—On ??????? Jb 17:2 (with Dageš f.
dirimens) see § 20 h.—In 2 K 3:24 ????? (before ?) is probably infinitive absolute, used in
order to avoid the hiatus, cf. § 113 x, and on a similar case in Qal, see above, n.—On the

17. In Aramaic the imperfect and participle of all the conjugations terminate in ? ?? or ? ??.

In General.

The Hebrew infinitives, imperatives, and imperfects in ? ??, less frequently ? ?? or ? ??, may be
due to imitation of these forms. On the infinitive construct Pi??l ?????, see above, aa; imperative
Qal ????? Jb 37:6 (in the sense of fall); imperfect ????? let him look out, Gn 41:33 (but see above,
p); ? ??????? he will do, Is 64:3; ??????????? Jer 17:17; ???????? consent thou not, Pr 1:10; ? ??????????
do thou not, 2 S 13:12 (the same form in Gn 26:29, Jos 7:9, Jer 40:16 Qerê); ???????? (so Baer
and Ginsburg, after cod. Hillel, &c.) I will be, Jer 31:1; ? ????????? Jos 9:24; ??????? Dn 1:13. Cf.
also in Niph?al ??????? Lv 5:9; ??????? (according to Qim?i) Nu 21:27; in Pi??l ??????? Lv 18:7, 8, 12–
17, 20:19, in each case  ??????? ???
 (Baer ???????) Na 1:3;
??????? Ez 5:12 (with Zaqeph; Baer ???????). The fact, however, that a great number of these forms
occur in pause and represent at the same time a jussive or voluntative (Jos 7:9), suggests the
view that the ?ere is used merely to increase the emphasis of the pausal form, and at the same
time to make a distinction in sound between the jussive or voluntative and the ordinary
imperfect.1 Elsewhere (Gn 26:29, Lv 5:9, Jer 40:16, Dn 1:13; according to Baer also Mi 7:10,
Zc 9:5) the pronunciation with ê is probably intended to soften the hiatus caused by a
following ? or ?; cf. the analogous cases above, § 74 l.

, beside ??????? with a minor distinctive;

??????

??

?

The ending ? ?? appears to stand for ? ?? in the imperfect Qal in ? ???????????? and there hath she

played the harlot, Jer 3:6; perhaps, however, the 2nd sing. fem. is intended, or it may have
been introduced into the text of Jeremiah from Ez 16:15, &c. Still more strange is it in the
imperfect Hiph???l
reading (cf. Neh 13:14). The ? ?? stands for   ???  in the perfect Hiph???l ???????? he made sick, Is
53:10, which is probably for ????? from ???, a secondary form of ???; see rr. The plur. ????????
(Baer ?????????) they made to melt, Jos 14:8, is a purely Aramaic form.

 Jer 18:23; but the Mil??l-tone probably points to

??????  as the correct

18. In two verbs the rare conjugation Pa?l?l or its reflexive (§ 55 d) occurs: ??????????

whence reflexive ???????? ???? to bow oneself, to prostrate oneself, 2nd pers. in

19. Before suffixes in all forms ending in ?, a connecting vowel is employed instead of the

? and the connecting vowel which precedes it (§ 58 f), e.g.

The Relation between Verbs ??? and ???.

20. The close relation existing between verbs ??? and ??? is shown in Hebrew by the fact

that the verbs of one class often borrow forms from the other, especially in the later writers
and the poets.

21. Thus there are forms of verbs ???—

?????

????

(a) Which have adopted the vowels of verbs ???, e.g. perfect Qal

 I have refrained,
Ps 119:101; participle ????? (?????) sinning, Ec 2:26, 8:12, 9:2, 18; cf. Is 65:20; ????? Ec 7:26;
? ??? lending, 1 S 22:2; Pi??l perfect ????? he has filled, Jer 51:34; cf. 1 K 9:11, Am 4:2 (where,
however, the perfect Niph. is perhaps intended), Ps 89:11, 143:3;
 I heal, 2 K 2:21; cf.
Jer 51:9; imperfect ??????? Jb 39:24; Niph?al perfect
1:26; Hiph???l perfect ??????? Dt 28:59;
 (not
????
????
On the other hand, forms like ??????? 1 S 14:33, ??????? Ps 99:6, ??????? Ez 47:8,
), and ????? imperative plur. masc.
according to the correct reading, Jb 19:2 (cf. Gn 31:39
from ????? Jos 24:14, 1 S 12:24, Ps 34:10, are due to the elision of the ?, see § 74 i. On ??????? Jer
10:5 and ????? Ps 139:20, see § 23 i.

 (like ?????????) it was wonderful, 2 S
, cf. above, 2 S 1:26) she hid, Jos 6:17.

????

,

(b) Forms in ?, but keeping their ??? vowels, e.g. imperfect Qal ??????? Jer 3:22; imperative
????? heal thou, Ps 60:4; Niph?al; ??????? Jer 49:10 (which must evidently be a perfect; read with
Ewald the infinitive absolute ??????? as in verse 23), and ??????? to hide oneself, 1 K 22:25, cf. Jer
19:11; Pi??l imperfect ??????? he will fill, Jb 8:21.

(c) Forms entirely of a ??? character, e.g. perfect Qal ??????? and when thou art athirst, Ru

2:9, cf. 2 S 3:8; ???? they shut up, 1 S 6:10; cf. 25:33; ???? they are full, Ez 28:16, cf. 39:26;
infinitive ???? (see above, n) to sin, Gn 20:6 (on ?????? see above, § 74 h); imperative sing. fem.
????? Is 26:20; imperfect ??????? (for ???????) he will keep back, Gn 23:6;
participle ?????? Pr 12:18; fem.
Niph?al
????????? 2 K 2:22 (infinitive Jer 19:11); Pi??l imperfect ???????? Jer 8:11, cf. Gn 31:39; Hiph???l
participle ??????? Ez 8:3; Hithpa?el
????? 2 K 19:25, Jablonski and others require as Qerê the form ??? ?????? (so Is 37:26); the
Keth??bh would have to be read ???????, with elision of the ? and retraction of the vowel.

 Is 29:7; participle passive ????? Ps 32:1;
 thou hast prophesied, Jer 26:9 (cf. Ps 139:14, Jb 18:3); imperfect

 1 S 10:6; infinitive ????????? 1 S 10:13. For the Keth??bh

 they heal, Jb 5:18;

 Jer 51:9;

22. On the other hand, there are forms of verbs ???, which wholly or in part follow the
analogy of verbs ???, e.g. in their consonants ???? he comes, Is 21:12; ????? 2 S 12:17 (textus
receptus ?????);
Lv 10:19; ???????? Dt 28:66 (cf. Ho 11:7); ??????? (infin. absol. Niph?al beside
2 K 25:29; ??????? Jer 38:4; ??? ???? Ec 8:1: in their vowels,
17:14: in both, ??????? Gn 49:1; cf. 42:4, Is 51:19; ??????? 2 S 21:12 Qerê; ?????? 2 Ch 26:15 (cf.
??????? ????? 2 S 11:24 Keth??bh); ??????? (participle fem. Qal) Zp 3:1; ???????? Ho 13:15; ?????????? La
4:2.—For ??????? (so Baer, Ez 17:6, cf. 31:8), which can only be intended for ????????
participle fem. plur. from ?????=?????, read ?????? branches, according to Ez 31:5, &c.

 Ex 1:10,
 Ez 43:27; ??? ???? Jb 8:11; ??? ???? La 4:1; ?????????? 2 Ch 16:12;

§ 76. Verbs Doubly Weak.

1. In a tolerably large number of verbs two radicals are weak letters, and are
consequently affected by one or other of the anomalies already described. In cases
where two anomalies might occur, usage must teach whether one, or both, or neither
of them, takes effect.

Thus e.g. from ????? to flee, the imperfect is ????? in Na 3:7 and ????? in Gn 31:40 (on the
analogy of verbs ???); Hiph???l ????? (like a verb ???), but the imperfect Hoph?al again ????? (as
???).

2. The following are examples of difficult forms, which are derived from doubly

weak verbs:

(a) Verbs ??? and ??? (cf. § 66 and § 74), e.g. ? ???? to bear, imperative ? ?? (Ps 10:12 ? ????, of

which ????? Ps 4:7 is probably only an orthographic variation); infinitive construct ??? ?? (for
?????? ; see the analogous noun-formations in § 93 t), also ???? Is 1:14, 18:3; Gn 4:13 ?????; Ps
89:10 ??? (perhaps only a scribal error); after the prefix ? always ?? ???? (otherwise the
contracted form only occurs in ??????? Jb 41:17, with rejection of the ?); imperfect
??????????
?????
and also the Mantua ed., and Ginsburg,
Niph?al (on the analogy of the infinitive construct Qal?); but most probably ????? is to be read,
with Driver.

 Ez 23:49 (so Baer after Qim?i; textus receptus,
) and ??????? 2 S 19:43 as infinitive absolute

 Ru 1:14; wholly irregular are

???????
?????

?????????

??????

 for

(b) Verbs ??? and ??? (cf. § 66 and § 75), as ????? to bow, to incline, ????? to smite. Hence
imperfect Qal ?????, apocopated ????? (Gn 26:25 ??????) and he bowed; ????? (so, probably, also Is 63:3
for ?????) 2 K 9:33 and he sprinkled (from ?????); perfect Hiph???l ????? he smote, imperfect ?????,
apocopated ????, ?????? (even with Athna? 2 K 15:16; but also ten times ???????), ?????? Dt 2:33; so also
????? Lv 8:11, 30; ?????? Ps 141:4 (cf. Jb 23:11); imperative ?????, apocopated ???? smite thou (like
??? incline, with ?????), infinitive ?????, participle ?????; Hoph?al ?????, participle ?????.

(c) Verbs ??? and ??? (cf.§ 68 and § 75), as ???? to be willing, ???? to bake, ???? to come.

E.g. imperfect Qal ??????, ??????, plur. ?????; ??????? (cf. § 68 h) Dt 33:21 for ???????? (=?????????);
 Is 21:12, 56:9, 12 (cf. ???? bake

imperfect apocopated ?????? Is 41:25 for ????????; imperative
 (§ 23 h; § 75 u); Hiph???l perfect

???

imperfect apocopated

already become quiescent, is made audible again by the helping Seghôl (unless perhaps there
is a confusion with the imperfect consecutive Hiph???l of ???).

§ 77. Relation of the Weak Verbs to one another.

The close relation which exists between some classes of the weak verbs (e.g.
between ??? and ???, ??? and ???, ??? and ???, ??? and ???) appears not only in their
similarity or identity of inflexion, or their mutual interchange of certain forms, but
especially from the fact that frequently the same root (radix bilittera, see § 30 g)
recurs in various weak stems of similar meaning. The meaning accordingly is inherent
in the two constant root-consonants, while the third consonant(cid:31), which is weak (and
the particular class of weak verbs with it), does not establish any difference in the
meaning. Thus from the root ??? there occur with the same meaning ??????, ????, ????? to
strike, to crush; and from the root ?? there are ???, ?????, ????? to flee.

In this manner the following classes are related in form and meaning:

1. Verbs ??? and ??? in which the first and third consonants are the same in both, as being

essential to the meaning; e.g. ???? and ?????? to become poor; ??? and ? ???? to feel; ??? and ????? to
flee.

ZAW. ZAW, = Zeitschrift für die alttestamentliche Wissenschaft, ed. by B. Stade,
Giessen, 1881 ff., and since 1907 by K. Marti.

2. Verbs ??? and ???; e.g. ????? and ????? to place, ????? and ???? (y?q?s?) to lay snares.
Moreover, stems belonging to the classes mentioned in 1 (especially ???) are frequently
related also to verbs ??? and ???, e.g. ??? and ????? to fear; ??? and ????? to be good; ????? and ???? to
blow; ????? and ??? to dash to pieces. Verbs ??? are less frequently connected with these classes,
e.g. ???? and ??? to thresh, &c.

3. Verbs ??? and ??? (in which the first two consonants form the real body of the stem)
are sometimes related to each other, and sometimes to the above classes. To each other, in ?????
and ????? to crush, ????? and ????? to meet (cf. § 75 nn); to verbs of the other classes, in ????? and
????? to suck, ????? and ???? to thrust, &c.

4. Verbs ??? and ???, on which cf. Grimm, Journal of Bibl. Lit., 1903, p. 196; e.g. ???? and

???? to sigh, ????? and ????? to be quiet, ????? and ????? to incline, ????? and ????? to end, ????? and  ?????
despise, ??? ?? and ??? ?? to err, ??? ?? and ??? ?? to bend down, ??? ?? and ??? ?? to plunder.

 to

5. Verbs ??? and ???; e.g. ??? and ????? (New Hebrew; in O. T. only ????? Is 1:22) to
circumcise, ??? and ????? to exchange, ??? (in ??????? a light) and ????? to shine; cf. also ????????
secret arts, Ex 7:11 with ??? secret, from ???.

§ 78. Verba Defectiva.

It often happens, when two kindred weak verbs are in use with the same meaning,
that both are defective, i.e. do not occur in all the forms. Since, however, those tenses
and forms which are not in use in the one verb are generally supplied by the other,
they mutually complete one another, and thus form together, as it were, an entire verb,
as in Greek ????µ??, aor. ?????, fut. ??????µ??, and in Latin fero, tuli, latum, ferre,
&c., but with this difference, that in Hebrew the roots of these verbs are almost
always closely related.

The most common verbs of this kind are—

?? to be ashamed. Hiph???l ?????? (inferred from  ??????

), but also

??????

, ?????? as if from

????

???, on the analogy of verbs ???; also in Is 30:5 the Qerê requires ??????, where the Keth??bh has
???????? from ????.

??? to be good. Perfect ???; but imperfect ??????. and Hiph???l ??????? from ????? (but cf.

K 10:30).

?????  to be afraid. Imperfect ????? (from ???).

???

???????

 2

????? to awake, only in the imperf. ??????; for the perfect, the Hiph???l ?????? is used (from ???).

????? to break in pieces. Imperfect ????? (from ???). Imperative ???. Niph?al ?????. Pi??l ?????

(from ?????). Pôl?l ????? (from ???). Reflexive ?????????. Hiph???l ??????. Also ??????? Jb 16:12.

????? (Qal in post-biblical Hebrew, in Aramaic and Arabic) to place, whence (possibly)

Niph?al ????? and Hiph???l ?????? (see above, § 71); but Hithpa??l ?????????.

??? ?? to drink, used in Qal; but in Hiph. ??? ???? to give to drink, from a Qal ??? ?? which is not

used in Hebrew.

On ?????? (??????) to go, see above, § 69 x.

Rem. 1. To the same category belong also, to a certain extent, those cases where the

tenses or moods not in use in one conjugation, are supplied by forms having the same
meaning in other conjugations of the same verb. Thus:

????? to add. The infinitive (but cf. § 69 h, note) and imperfect, unused in Qal, are supplied

by the Hiph???l ??????, ?????? (on ????? as imperfect indicative, see § 109 d, cf. also § 109 i).

? ???? to stumble. Perfect from Qal, imperfect from Niph?al.

??? to approach, unused in perf. Qal, instead of which Niph?al ????? is used; but imperfect
???? ??  from Qal only are in use.

?????, imperative ???, and infinitive

????? to lead. Perfect usually ????? in Qal, so imperative ?????, but imperfect and infinitive

always in Hiph???l.

??? to be poured out. Perfect Niph?al ?????? with imperfect Qal ??????, but the perfect Qal and

imperfect Niph?al are not in use.

2. The early grammarians often speak of mixed forms (formae mixtae), i.e. forms which
unite the supposed character and meaning of two different tenses, genders, or conjugations.
Most of the examples adduced are at once set aside by accurate grammatical analysis; some
others appear to have arisen from misapprehension and inaccuracy, especially from erroneous
views of unusual plene forms. Others, again, are either merely wrong readings or represent an
intentional conflation of two different readings.

1. Since, according to § 30 a, most word-stems are developed into verbal stems as
well as into noun-stems, it has become customary (especially in the Lexicon) to refer
the noun to the most simple ground-form of the verbal formation, viz. the 3rd pers.
sing. perfect Qal, and, as it were, to derive it from that form. This is usual, not only in
those noun-stems which can be directly connected with a corresponding verbal stem
(Nomina verbalia or derivativa, § 83 ff.), but also with Nomina primitiva, i.e. those of
which no verbal stem is now found in Hebrew (see § 82), as well as finally with
Nomina denominativa, which have evidently been derived from other nouns (§ 86).

The adjective agrees in form entirely with the substantive. On the formation of adjectival

ideas by giving to abstracts a concrete sense, see § 83 c.

2. A special inflexion of the noun to express the various cases does not exist in
Hebrew; only a few ancient and almost extinct traces of case-endings have survived
(§ 90). The syntactical relation of a noun can therefore in general only be inferred
from its position in the sentence, or from its being joined to prepositions. In either
case, the form of the noun undergoes no change (except for the construct state, § 89),
and the representation of case-relations belongs therefore almost exclusively to the
syntax (§ 117 ff.). The comparative and superlative of adjectives also can be
expressed only by a syntactical combination (§ 133). On the other hand, several
changes in the forms of nouns are occasioned by the additions of the plural, dual, and
feminine terminations, as well as of the pronominal suffixes, and also by the close
connexion of two nouns, by means of the construct state.1

against him J. Barth, ZDMG. 1903, p. 628 ff.; Brockelmann’s reply, ibid., p. 795 ff.; and
Barth again, ibid., p. 798 ff.

1. The Hebrew, like all Semitic languages, recognizes only two genders in the
noun, a masculine and a feminine. Inanimate objects and abstract ideas, which other
languages sometimes indicate by the neuter, are regarded in Hebrew either as
masculine or feminine, more often the latter (see the Syntax, § 122 q).

2. The masculine, as being the more common and important gender, has no special

indication.

Feminine nouns are also without an indication of gender when the meaning of the
word naturally denotes a feminine, as ??? mother, ???? a she-ass, ??? a she-goat, ????? an
ewe (cf. § 122 b). As a rule, however, the feminine had originally the ending ? ??, as in
the 3rd sing. perfect of verbs (§ 44 a). This ? ??, however, is regularly retained in
Hebrew only in close connexion with a following genitive or suffix (cf. § 89 e and §
91 o), except where the form has arisen through the addition of a simple ?2 (see

1 1 To speak of these changes as a declension of the Hebrew noun, as is usually done,
is accordingly incorrect.

Hoph(cid:31)al; but ??? ???? (so Baer and Ginsb.) is also supported by good authority.

below, d). Otherwise, the feminine ending of the independent form (the absolute state,
§ 89 a) is—

(a) Most commonly a tone-bearing ? ??, e. g. ??? equus, ????? equa. Of nouns
ending in ??, like ???????, the feminine (by § 24 b) is ?????????, cf. § 86 h. As in the 3rd sing.
fem. perfect (????????, &c.), this ? ?? seems to have arisen by the rejection of the final ?,
and the lengthening of the ? in the open syllable, whereupon the ? was added as an
orthographic indication of the final long vowel: cf. the exactly similar origin of such
forms as ????? for ?????, § 75 c. It must, however, be noticed that in Arabic (see m and
note) the pausal form of at is ah, of which a trace may be preserved in the Hebrew ? ??.

(b) Simple ? with nouns ending in a vowel, e. g. ??????? Jew, ???????? Jewess. The same

. The forms which arise in this way follow in every respect the analogy of the

ending ? is very frequently added to stems ending in a consonant, but only (except
before suffixes) by means of a helping vowel, which, as a rule, is Seghôl, but after
gutturals Patha?, e. g. ?????, fem.
according to the rule given in § 69 c, cf. also § 84a s; ????? an acquaintance, fem.
????????
segholate forms (§ 94 f). The forms which have been developed by means of a
helping vowel are retained even in the connective form (construct state); except ??????????

when even final vowels were not supported by a vowel-letter. Cf. also ????? fecunda (a fruitful
tree) Gn 49:22; ??????? abundance, Jer 48:36 (before ?; but in Is 15:7  ??????

????? bitter, Ru 1:20. On the other hand, according to the western Masora, ??????? baldness is to
be read in Ez 27:31; see Baer on the passage.

????

??? ?????

 an oven heated,

Ho 7:4; cf. Ez. 40:19, 2 K 15:29, 16:18. In all those examples the usual tone-bearing ? ?? is
perhaps intended, but the Punctuators, who considered the feminine ending inappropriate,
produced a kind of locative form (see § 90 c) by the retraction of the tone. [In 2 K 16:18, Is
24:19, Ez 21:31 (note in each case the following ?), and in Jb 42:13, Ho 7:4, the text is
probably in error.]

(f) ? ??, as an old feminine termination, preserved also in Syriac (ai; see examples in
Nöldeke’s Syrische Gram, § 83), in Arabic and (contracted to ê) in Ethiopic, very probably
occurs in the proper name ??? ?? Sarai, cf. Nöldeke, ZDMG. xl. 183, and xlii. 484; also ??? ???? ten
(fem.) undoubtedly arises from an original (cid:31)esray; so Wright, Comparative Grammar, p.
138; König, Lehrgebäude, ii. 427.

3. It is wholly incorrect to regard the vowel-ending ? ??2 as the original termination of the

feminine, and the consonantal ending ? ?? as derived from it. The Ethiopic still has the ?
throughout, so too the Assyrian (at, it); in Phoenician also the feminines end for the most part
in ?, which is pronounced at in the words found in Greek and Latin authors; less frequently in
? (see Gesenius, Monumm. Phoen., pp. 439, 440; Schröder, Phön. Sprache, p. 169 ff.). The
ancient Arabic has the obtuse ending (ah) almost exclusively in pause; in modern Arabic the
relation between the two endings is very much as in Hebrew.

§ 81. Derivation of Nouns.

1 1 In 1 S 20:27 also, where the Masora (see Baer on Jos 5:11) for some unknown
reason requires ??????, read with ed. Mant., Jablonski, Opitius, and Ginsburg, ??????.
2 2 In this ending the ? h can only be considered consonantal in the sense that the ?
was originally aspirated, and afterwards ‘the mute ? was dropped before h, just as the
old Persian mithra became in modern Persian mihr’; so Socin, who also points to the
Arabic pausal form in ah, and observes that among some of the modern Beduin an h
is still heard as a fem. ending, cf. Socin, Diwan aus Centralarabien, iii. 98, ed. by H.
Stumme, Lpz. 1901. In Hebrew this consonantal termination was entirely abandoned,
at any rate in later times.

Brockelmann, Grundriss, p. 329 ff.

Nouns are by their derivation either primitive, i.e. cannot be referred to any verbal
stem at present extant (see § 82), such as ?? father, ??? mother (but see both words in
the Lexicon; according to Stade and others ??, ???, &c., are children’s words and terms
of endearment, and so really primitive nouns), or derivative, i.e. either Derivativa
verbalia (§§ 83–5), e. g. ??? high, ????? high place, ????? height, from ??? to be high, or
less frequently Derivativa denominativa (§ 86), e. g. ????????? the place at the feet, from
?????

 foot.

Rem. 1. The earlier grammarians consider the verb alone as stem, and therefore all nouns

as verbals, dividing them into (a) Formae nudae, i.e. such as have only the three (or two)
radicals, and (b) Formae auctae, such as have formative letters or syllables added at the
beginning or end, e. g. ?????????, ???????. The formative letters used for this purpose are
? ? ?
 ?
? ? ?
??????????? ),1 and the treatment of nouns formerly followed this order.
(

??

According to the view of roots and stems presented in § 30 d, nouns (other than
denominatives) are derived not from the verbal stem, but either from the (abstract) root or
from the still undefined stem. In the following pages, however, the arrangement according to
the verbal stem is retained as being simpler for the beginner. Cf. § 79 a.

2. Compound nouns as appellatives are very rare in Hebrew, e. g.

??????????

 worthlessness,

baseness. On the other hand, they very frequently occur as proper names, e. g. ?????????? (man of
God), ??????????? (Yahwe raises up), ?????????? (Yahwe gave), &c.2

§ 82. Primitive Nouns.

The number of primitive nouns in the sense used in § 81 is small, since nouns,
which in other languages are represented as independent noun-stems, can easily be
traced back in Hebrew to the verbal idea, e. g. names of animals and natural objects,
as ???? ?? he-goat (prop. shaggy, from ??? ??), ????? ?? barley (prop. prickly, also from ??? ??),
???????? stork (prop. pia, sc. avis), ????? gold (from ?????=????? to shine, to be yellow). Thus
there remain only a few nouns, e. g. several names of members of the body in men or
beasts, to which a corresponding verbal stem cannot be assigned at all, or at any rate
only indirectly (from other Semitic dialects), as

 eye.

??????  horn,

??????

§ 83. Verbal Nouns in General.

1. In Hebrew, as in Greek and Latin, the verbal nouns are connected in form and

meaning primarily with certain forms of the verb, especially the participles and
infinitives, which are themselves, even in their ordinary form, frequently used
precisely like nouns, e. g. ????? enemy,

??????  to know, knowledge. Still oftener, however,

1 1 From this vox memorialis the nomina aucta are also called by the older
grammarians nomina heemantica.
2 2 G. Rammelt (Über die zusammengesetzten Nomina im Hebr., Halle, 1883, and
Leipzig, 1884) recognizes as appellatives only
(the latter certainly incorrectly [see, however, Nöldeke, ZATW 1897, p. 183 ff.]). In p.
8 ff. the author gives a list of ‘logical compounds’, i.e. new terms formed by
composition with the negatives ???, ?????,

 (cf. below, § 85 w) and

??????(cid:31)???

??????? .

??????

????

certain forms of the infinitive and participle, which are seldom or never found as such
in the strong verb, though in use in the weak verb and in the kindred dialects, came to
be commonly used for the verbal noun; e. g. the participial form ?????, the infinitives of
the (Aramaic) form ??????? (as a noun also ???????), further
d), &c. Others (as the Arabic shows) are properly intensive forms of the participle.

, ???????, ???????, ??????? (§ 45

????????

2. As regards their meaning, it follows from the nature of the case that nouns
which have the form of the infinitive regularly denote the action or state, with other
closely related ideas, and are therefore mostly abstract; while the participial nouns, on
the contrary, denote for the most part the subject of the action or state, and are
therefore concrete. Moreover, it is to be noticed, that a particular meaning is attached
to many of the special forms of derivative nouns, although it does not appear equally
in them all.

Rem. It need not appear strange, when we consider the analogy of other languages, that a
noun which in form is properly abstract afterwards acquired a concrete sense, and vice versa.
So in English, we say his acquaintance, for the persons with whom he is acquainted; the
Godhead for God himself; in Hebrew ????? acquaintance and an acquaintance.

The inner connexion in thought between Semitic noun-forms and the corresponding
verbal forms is investigated in the works of De Lagarde and Barth (see the titles at the head of
§ 79) on very different lines, but with many points of agreement. De Lagarde starts from the
fact that language consists of sentences. A sentence which consists of only one word is called
a verb, and anything which serves as a complement to it is a noun. The oldest form of the
sentence is the imperative. Closely related to it are three kinds of sentences of the nature of
verbal forms, differing according as the property of the particular object of sense is to be
represented as invariable (form qatula), or as liable to change (form qatila), or, finally, as a
circumstance which takes place before our eyes (form qatala). Like the imperative, these
three forms of sentences have also been transformed into nouns, by means of certain phonetic
changes,—especially by the omission of the final vowels and the addition of different
terminations to the last consonant of the stem. But just as the forms of the verbal sentence
undergo numerous modifications (in the tenses, moods, and conjugations), so also do the
nouns, sometimes by assimilation of the unessential to the characteristic vowel (qutul, qitil),
sometimes by the lengthening of the characteristic vowel (qatûl, qat??l, qatâl), or else through
the displacement of the accent and the consequent reduction of the noun to a monosyllabic
form (qatl, qutl, qitl), or, finally, by their being formed from the derived stems (or
conjugations), e. g. qattal, qattâl; qutil, qittâl, &c. Further modifications arise from the use of
the various imperfect and infinitive forms, and also from the employment of the prefix m.
Lastly, denominalia are formed from deverbalia by appending certain suffixes.

De Lagarde does not, however, claim to be able to show in the case of each particular
noun the sense it conveyed in primitive times; the origin of a number of nouns can now no
longer be detected. In those, however, which are clearly derived from verbs, the original
meaning is chiefly determined by the characteristic vowel.

Barth’s system is based on the thesis that ‘all Semitic nouns, adjectives, and participles
are derived from either the perfect or the imperfect stem’. Thus, e. g. ????? is the infinitive of
the perfect stem, ????? the infinitive of the imperfect stem, ??? ?? infinitive of ??? ????, &c. In
dissyllabic noun-forms the second vowel is always alone characteristic and essential, the first
vowel unessential, and therefore variable. Further modifications of the simple form are
effected by strengthening (sharpening) the second or third consonant, by lengthening the
characteristic vowel (instead of which, however, the feminine termination may also be used),

or by ‘metaplasm’, i.e. by the use of noun-forms derived from one of the two intransitive
stems for the other, e. g. qutl for qitl, and vice versa.

In nouns of the perfect stem, the vowels i and u indicate intransitive formations, the
vowel a a transitive sense. In nouns of the imperfect stem on the contrary, u and i, being
characteristic vowels, indicate a transitive and a an intransitive sense: for yaqt?l? is imperfect
of the transitive perfect qatala, and yaqt?l? imperfect of the intransitive perfects qatila and
qatula, &c. This explains how nouns, apparently identical in form, may yet in sense belong to
different classes: a qutl-form from a u-imperfect has a transitive meaning, but the same form
from a u-perfect has an intransitive meaning. This double system of perfect and imperfect
forms runs through the whole scheme of noun-formation, not only the forms connected with
the conjugations, but also the forms with prefixes and suffixes.

Against the whole theory it has been urged that it postulates for the development of the
language a much too abstract mechanism, and further, that the meanings of words as we find
them may in many cases be due to a modification of the original sense. But though many of
the details (e. g. the alleged unessential character of the vowel of the first syllable) remain
doubtful, yet the agreement between the characteristic vowel of certain noun formations and
that of the perfect or imperfect stem, is supported by such a number of incontestable
instances, that there can be no doubt as to a systematic, intimate connexion between the two.
At the same time it must be admitted that De Lagarde has put forward many important and
suggestive points, and both scholars agree in laying stress on one characteristic vowel as
indicative of the meaning.

§ 84a. Nouns derived from the Simple Stem.

Preliminary remark.—From the statement made above, § 83 d, it follows that an external

similarity between forms is no proof of their similar origin, and, vice versa, external
difference does not exclude the possibility of their being closely related both in origin and
meaning.

Nouns with One Vowel, originally Short.

R. R?zi?ka, ‘Beiträge zur Erklärung der nomina segolata, ’ in Sitz.-ber. d. böhmischen
Ges. d. Wiss., Prag, 1904.

1. Nouns with one of the three short vowels after the first radical: present ground-form

q??l, q???l, q??l.

The supposition of monosyllabic ground-forms appeared to be required by the character
of forms now existing in Hebrew, as well as in Arabic, &c. But there are strong reasons for
believing that at least a large proportion of these forms go back to original dissyllabic bases
with a short vowel in each syllable. When formative additions were made, the vowel of the
2nd syllable was dropped, i.e. before case-endings in Assyrian and early Arabic, and before
pronominal suffixes in Hebrew. From the forms thus produced, the bases qa?l, qi?l, qu?l have
been assumed, although they never appear in Hebrew except in the singular and then in
connexion with suffixes.

In support of this view of a large number of original dissyllabic bases, we must not,
however, appeal to the Seghôl or Patha? under the 2nd consonant of the existing developed
forms,

forms pronounceable,1 and consequently disappear when no longer needed. Under certain
circumstances even (e. g. in ?? ???) they are not used at all. Actual proofs of such original
toneless full vowels in the 2nd syllable of existing Segholates are—

1. Forms like Arab. mélik, for which rarely malk, corresponding to the Hebrew ground-

form; cf. De Lagarde, Uebersicht, p. 72 ff.

2. In Hebrew

3. The forms treated under e, which are in many ways related to the Segholates proper, in

so far as they are to be referred to original dissyllabic bases.

4. The plurals of Hebrew Segholates, since, with very rare exceptions, they take Qame?

under the 2nd radical before the termination ?? ??, fem. ???, of the absolute state, as ????????,
???????, ????????, &c. This Qame?see note 1 on § 26 e) can only be due to a lengthening of an
original short vowel in the 2nd syllable, and hence it would seem as though the vowel were
always ?. This is impossible from what has been said, especially under 1 and 2. Hence the
explanation of the consistent occurrence of Qame? in the plurals of all Segholates can only be
that the regularly formed plurals (i.e. from singulars with original ? in the 2nd syllable)
became the models for all the others, and ultimately even for some really monosyllabic
forms.2

??(cid:31)???
), with case-endings kalbu, šamsu, abnu. On the other hand, acc. to
??(cid:31)???
Sievers, Metrik, i. 261, Hebrew ground-forms probably have a twofold origin: they
are shortened according to Hebrew rules partly from old absolute forms like kálbu,
s??fru, qúdšu, and partly from old construct-forms like the Assyrian types kalab, sifir,
quduš.
2 2 On the other hand, Ungnad, ZA. 1903, p. 333 ff., rejecting all previous
explanations, maintains that the a in mel?kh?(cid:31)m, mel?khôth is inserted merely to
facilitate the pronunciation. From qa?l?(cid:31)m arose qa?alim, then qa?al?(cid:31)m and finally
qe??l?(cid:31)m. See, however, Nöldeke, ‘Zur semit. Pluralendung, ’ ZA. 1904, p. 68 ff.,
who points out that the Semitic nouns fa(cid:31)l, fi(cid:31)l, fu(cid:31)l with their corresponding
feminines fa(cid:31)la, &c., on assuming the plural termination commonly take an a before
the 3rd radical, but that no satisfactory account can be given for it. M. Margolis, ‘The
plural of Segolates’ (Proc. of the Philol. Assoc. of the Pacific Coast, San Francisco,
1903, p. 4 ff.), and S. Brooks, Vestiges of the broken plural in Hebrew, Dublin, 1883,
explain mel?kh?(cid:31)m as a pluralis fractus.
3 3 It is worthy of notice that St. Jerome also (cf. Siegfried, ZAW. iv. 76) frequently
represents the vowel of the first syllable by a, e. g. gader, aben, ader, areb, for ?????,
?????, ?????, ?????, but cedem, secel, deber, &c., for ?????, ??? ??, ?????, &c.

vowel ? to è does not occur, e. g.

consonantal value.

2. Nouns with one of the three short vowels under the second radical (present ground-
form qe??l, qe??l, qe??l), e. g. ????? honey, ????? sickness, ????? terror; and so always with middle ?,
????? a well, ????? a wolf, ???? stench. In reality these forms, like the segholates mentioned in No.
1 (see above, a), are, probably, for the most part to be referred to original dissyllabic forms,
but the tone has been shifted from its original place (the penultima) on to the ultima. Thus
dibáš (originally d??baš) as ground-form of ????? is supported both by the Hebrew ? ?????? (with
suffix of the first person), and by the Arabic dibs, the principal form; bi??r (according to
Philippi with assimilation of the vowel of the second syllable to that of the first) as ground-

1 1 M. Lambert also (REJ. 1896, p. 18 ff.), from statistics of the Segholates, arrives at
the conclusion that the qa?l-form is especially used for concretes (in nouns without
gutturals he reckons twenty concretes as against two abstracts), and the q?l-form, and
less strictly the q?l, for abstracts.

form of ????? is attested by the Arabic bir; for ???? (Arabic bus) similarly a ground-form buúš
may be inferred, just as a ground-form q???l underlies the infinitives of the form ?????.1

Nouns with an original Short Vowel in both Syllables.

3. The ground-form q???l, fem. q???l?t, developed in Hebrew to ????? (§ 93, Paradigm II,
a, b) and ??????? (§§ 94, 95, Paradigm II, a, b), mostly forms intransitive adjectives, as ????? wise,
????? new, ? ???? upright; but also substantives, as ????? a word, and even abstracts, as ? ??? guilt,
????? hunger, ??? ?? satiety; in the fem. frequently abstract, as ???????2 righteousness; with an initial
guttural ??????? earth.—Of the same formation from verbs ??? are ????? alone, ????? cloud; passive
?????  pierced.—In verbs ??? a final Yôdh is almost always rejected, and the ? of the second
syllable lengthened to è. Thus ??? ?? field, after rejection of the ? and addition of ? as a vowel-
letter, becomes ??? ?? (cf. § 93, Paradigm II, f); fem. e. g.  ?? ???  year; cf. § 95, Paradigm II, c.
From a verb ??? the strong form ????? afflicted occurs.

4. The ground-form q????l, fem. q????l?t, developed to ????? (§ 93, Paradigm II, c–e) and
???????, is frequently used as participle of verbs middle e (§ 50 b), and hence mostly with an
intransitive meaning; cf. ????? old, an old man; ????? heavy; fem. ??????? cattle, ??????? and ??? ????
darkness.—From verbs ???: irregularly, ??????????? the branches of it, Jer 11:16, &c., generally
referred to a sing. ?????? (stem ???), and ??????????? Ho 14:1 their women with child (from ?????, st.
constr. ?????, plur. st. absol. and constr. ?????).—From a verb ??? with consonantal W?w: ??? ?? at
ease, incorrectly written plene ???? ?? Jb 21:23.

5. The ground-form q???l, developed to ????? (also written ?????), generally forms
adjectives, e. g. ???? terrible, ????? piebald, ????? sweet, ????? speckled, ????? interwoven, ?????
round, ????? deep, ????? hilly, ????? golden; ????? small, only in sing. masc., with a parallel form
????? of the class treated under f, fem. ???????, plur. ????????. These forms are not to be confounded
with those in No. III, from the ground-form q??âl.—Fem. ???????, ??????? (glorious), ???????, ???????
(delicate), ???????, ???????, with sharpening of the third radical, in order to keep the original ?
short, and similarly in the plurals ????????, ????????, ????????, ???????? stores, &c.

6. The ground-form q???âl develops to ????? (cf. § 93, Paradigm II, Rem. 1), e.g. ????? heart,

????? a bunch of grapes, ??? ?? strong drink; from a verb ???, probably of this class is ?????,
generally contracted to ??? friend, ground-form ri?ay: the full form is preserved in
???????
friend, for

?????

Nouns with an original Short Vowel in the First and a Long Vowel in the Second
Syllable.

7. The ground-form q??âl in Hebrew always develops to the form ?????, the â becoming an

obscure ô. The fact that this form is also written ????? must not lead to the confusion of these
forms with those mentioned in No. 5, from the ground-form q??âl.1 Moreover the qa?ôl-class

1 1 On this theory cf. Stade, Hebräische Grammatik, § 199 b; De Lagarde, Übersicht,
p. 57 f.; A. Müller, ZDMG. xlv, p. 226, and especially Philippi, ZDMG. xlix, p. 208.
2 2 In St. Jerome’s time these forms were still pronounced ?adaca (???????), ?aaca
(???????), nabala (???????), &c., see Siegfried, ZAW. iv. 79. Moreover, the numerous
abstracts of this form (e. g. even ??????? a splintering, ??????? a crying, &c.) are
undoubtedly to be regarded (with Barth, Nominalbildung, p. 87) as feminines of
infinitives of the form q??âl, the lengthening of the second syllable being balanced, as
in other cases, by the addition of the feminine termination.
1 1 In Na 1:3 only the Qerê requires ?????? (in the constr. state) for the Keth?(cid:31)bh ?????.

includes forms of various origin, and therefore of various meaning, as (a) intransitive
adjectives like ????? great, ????? holy, fem. ???????, the short vowel becoming Šewâ, whereas in
?????, &c., before the tone it is lengthened to ?; (b) the infinitives absolute of the form ????? (§
45 a) as representing the abstract idea of the verb, and abstract substantives like ????? honour,
??? ?? peace (Arab. s?lâm); (c) substantives and adjectives in an active sense, as ????? assayer
(of metals,) ????? an oppressor, ????? oppressing; in the feminine ???????? treacherous Jer 3:7,
10, the irregular retention of the ? in the third syllable from the end is no doubt to be
explained, with Brockelmann, from Aramaic influence, the punctuator having in mind the
Aramaic nomen agentis qâ?ôl.

8. The ground-form q??îl develops to ?????? (cf. § 93, Paradigm IV, a and b). Here also
forms of various origin and meaning are to be distinguished: (a) adjectives used substantivally
with a passive meaning to denote duration in a state, as ????? a prisoner, ??? ???? an anointed one.
These proper q????l-forms are parallel to the purely passive qa?ûl-forms (see m), but others are
due to a strengthening of original qa??l-forms. These are either (b) intransitive in meaning, as
?????? small, and, from ??? stems, ????? pure, ????? poor (see § 93 vv), or (c) active, as ?????? a speaker
(prophet), ?????? an overseer.—Of a different kind again (according to Do Lagarde, infinitives)
are (d) forms like ????? the ingathering, ?????? vintage, ?????? ploughing time, ?????? harvest. On
q?????l forms with a kindred meaning, cf. § 84b f.

9. The ground-form q??ûl develops to ?????. As in the qa?âl and qa?îl-forms (see k and l),

so here forms of various kinds are to be distinguished: (a) qa?ûl-forms proper, with passive
meaning, especially all the passive participles of Qal; fem. e.g. ??????? virgin (properly
secluded). On the other hand, by strengthening an original qa??l-form we get (b) certain
stative adjectives (§ 50 f), as ???? incurable, ????? strong, ????? subtil, or even transitive, as ????
holding; (c) active substantives, as ????? a fowler. Further, some of the forms mentioned in §
84b g belong to this class; see above, the remark on l.

10. The ground-form q???âl or q??âl2 in Hebrew changes the ?? to vocal Šewâ, and develops
to ????? (cf. § 93, Paradigm IV, c) or ?????, with â obscured to ô (as above, k). Cf. ?? ?? remnant,
????? honour, ????? book (Arab. k??tâb), ????? war (the last three probably loan-words from the
Aramaic); of the other form, ????? a dream, ????? an ass (Arab. ???mâr), ?????? God (Arab. ’??lâh);
with ? prosthetic (§ 19 m), ???????? arm (twice: usually ??????); fem.  ??????
b??šâr?t); ??????? service,

 (Arab. k??tâb?t) tattooing.

 good news (Arab.

?

????????

11. The ground-form q?????l seems to occur e.g. in Hebrew ?????? foolish, ?????? vanity, ??????

lead, ?????? a fool, ?????? a swine (the prop. name ?????? points to the ground-form q?????l, cf. Arab.
???nz??r).

12. The ground-form q???ûl or q??ûl, Hebr. ?????, e.g. ????? a boundary, ????? a garment;

fem. ??????? strenght, ??????? faithfulness.

Rem. When the forms qe?ûl and qe?ôl begin with ?, they almost invariably take in the
singular a ?ere under the ? instead of the ordinary ?a?eph-Seghôl; cf. ????? a crib, ????? thread,
????? faithful, ????? hyssop, ????? a waist-band, ? ???? a bond, ????? an ‘ephod’; cf. § 23 h, and the
analogous cases of ?ere for ?a?eph-Seghôl in verbal forms § 52 n, § 63 p, § 76 d.

Beitraäge (Strassb. 1904), p. 30 ff. He includes among them
hemorrhoids.

 tow, and ????????

????(cid:31)???

Nouns with a Long Vocal in the First Syllable and originally a Short Vowel in the
Second Syllable.

13. The ground-form qâ??l, in Hebrew, always changes the â into an obscure ô, ?????
(?????), e.g. ????? (§ 93, Paradigm III, a), Arab. ?âl?m, eternity; ????? (Arab. ?ât?m) a seal
(according to Barth a loan-word of Egyptian origin), fem.
(unless from a stem ???, like ? ???? from ???; see the analogous cases in § 85 b). On the
participles Qal of verbs ??? (§ 93, Paradigm III, c), cf. § 75 e; on the feminines of the
participles Qal, which are formed with the termination ?, see below, s.

 (from ?ôt?mt); ????? worm

????????

Rem. Of a different kind (probably from a ground-form qau?al) are such forms as ????? (or

????? Ez 10:9 in the same verse) a wheel; ????? a young bird, ????? wax, &c.

14. The ground-form qâ???l also becomes in Hebrew almost invariably ????? (?????). Besides

participles active masc. Qal this class includes also feminines of the form
, if their
ground-form qô?alt (§ 69 c) goes back to an original qâ?ilt. The substantives of this form,
such as ????? priest (Arab. kâh??n), were also originally participles Qal. The fem. of the
substantives has ? (lengthened from ??) retained before the tone, e.g. ??????? a woman in travail
(cf. also ???????? the treacherous woman, Jer 3:8; ?????????? her that halteth, Mi 4:6 f., Zp 3:19;
???????? a buckler, Ps 91:4); the participles as a rule have the form ????????, &c., the original ??
having become Sewâ; however, the form with ?ere occurs also in the latter, Is 29:6, 8, 34:9,
Ps 68:26, 118:16 (all in principal pause; in subordinate pause 2 S 13:20, Is 33:14; with a
conjunctive accent, Ct 1:6). Cf. ??????? 2 S 13:20

????????

15. The ground-form qû??l, Hebrew ????? (as ????? river, Jer 17:8) or ????? e.g. ????? a pipe,

commonly ?????, and to be so read, with Baer, also in Ps 150:4, not ?????.

Nouns with a Long Vowel in each Syllable

16. ??????, e.g. ?????? smoke. The few forms of this kind are probably derived from the

ground-form q???âl (q????âl ?), i.e. the original â has become an obscure ô.

§ 84b. Formation of Nouns from the Intensive Stem.

This includes all forms which have arisen, either through the doubling of the
middle radical, or the repetition of one or of two consonants of the simple stem.

Nouns with the Middle Consonant sharpened.

As in the corresponding verbal stems (cf. § 52 f), so also in some noun-formations of this

class, the Dageš in the second radical expresses an intensification of the idea of the stem,
either emphasizing the energy of the action or relation, or else indicating a longer continuance
of the relation or state. Other nouns of this character are evidently only by-forms of the nouns
derived from the simple stem, which were treated in the last section: cf. the instances adduced
under f and g, and Barth, Nominalbildung, Introd., p. x.

???????

17. The ground-form q????l is mostly lengthened in Hebrew to ?????; cf. ???? a stag, fem.
 (from ’?yy?lt); cf. also the fem. (originating from Qal) ???????? a flame

??????, constr. st.
(according to § 27 q for l?hh?bh?), ???????? dry land (for ?arr?bh?),
 a burning
 and
fever, ? ?????? and
 consumption. Adjectives of this class
????????
(‘intensified participles of the active verb’, Barth, ibid., § 33) are ????? sinful, ????? wont to gore,

?????? ??  dry land,

 a seal-ring,

?? ??????

????????

????????

????? jealous, ????? (for ka??âš, by § 22 c) lying. Nomina opificum also, curiously enough, are so
treated in Hebrew (at least in the constr. state of the sing.), although the corresponding Arabic
form q?ttâl points to an original (unchangeable) â in the second syllable; cf. ????? a thief, ????? a
judge (constr. st. ????? Ps 68:6), ????? a cook, ????? (for ?arrâš) artificer (constr. st. ?????, but plur.
constr. ? ???????); ????? horseman (for parrâš), const. st. ????? Ez 26:10.

18. The ground-form q?????l appears in ????? dry, ????? haughty (the ?? being lengthened to ?

according to § 22 c), if these forms go back to original ??????y, g??’’?y. On the analogy,
however, of the adjectives denoting defects (see d below), we should rather expect a ground-
form q?????l; moreover, ’iwwalt, ground-form of the fem.
original iwwilt, see § 69 c.

 foolishness, goes back to an

????????

19. The ground-form q????l and q????l; cf. the fem.

????????

 spelt,

????????

 coat.

20. The ground-form q?????l; from the intensive stem, the infinitives Pi??l of the form ?????.

21. The ground-form q??????l, in Hebrew lengthened to ?????. Of this form are a considerable

number of adjectives which denote a bodily or mental fault or defect. Cf. ????? disabled, ?????
dumb, ????? hump-backed, ????? blind, ????? deaf (for ?irr?š), ?????? lame, ?????? bald, ????? perverse;
?????? open-eyed follows the same analogy.

22. The ground-form q???âl, cf. the remarks in b above, on the nomina opificum;
moreover, to this class belong infinitives Pi??l of the Aramaic form ??????? a searching out;
? ?????? a request; with middle guttural (see § 22 c) ??????? contumely; but cf. also
 Ez
35:12, with full lengthening of the original ? before ?; ???????? comfort. From the attenuation of
the ? of this form to ??, arises undoubtedly:

????????

????

23. The ground-form q????âl, e.g. ????? husbandman (Arab. ’?kkâr).

24. The ground-form q????ôl, most probably only a variety of the form q???âl with the ?

attenuated to ?? (as in No. 23), and the â obscured to ô (as in n and r); cf. ????? hero (Arab.
g?bbâr), ????? caviller, ????? (piper or chirper) a bird, ??? ?? drunkard. On the other hand, ?????
born probably arises from yullôd, an old participle passive of Qal, the ? being dissimilated in
the sharpened syllable before ô: so Barth, ibid., p. 41 f.

25. The ground-form q?????l, ??????, almost exclusively of persons, who possess some
quality in an intensive manner, e.g. ????? strong, ?????? righteous, ??????? fugitive (for barr??a?),
?????? violent (for ??rrî?).

That some of these are only by-forms of the q????l-class (see above, remark on a), appears
from the constr. st. ?????? ravenous, Is 35:9 (but ??????????, ????????? always), and according to Barth
(ibid., 35 a) also from the constr. st. ?????? (but also ????? 1 S 21:8) of ?????. However, the form
??????, as a name of God, may be intentionally differentiated from ?????, a poetic term for the
bull.

In the same way ????? prisoner, ?????? eunuch (constr. st. always ??????, plur. ??????????, constr.

st. ???????? Gn 40:7, but in the book of Esther always ?????????, with suffix ??????????, &c.), and ??????
weaned, may be regarded as by-forms of the q????l-class with passive meaning, see § 84a l.

26. The ground-form q???ûl, ?????, e.g. ????? gracious, ????? compassionate (with virtual
strengthening of the ?), ????? diligent (for ?arrû?), probably, again, to a large extent by-forms
of the q??ûl-class, § 84a m. The same applies to substantives like ????? a step (in ???????, as

well as ?? ????, &c.), ????? pillar; fem. ??????? a stripe (also ?????????), ??????? security: cf. Barth,
ibid., § 84.

27. The ground-form q???ôl; besides the infinitives absolute Pi??l of the form ?????, also

????? jealous (as well as ?????, an obscured form of q???âl, see e).

28. The ground-form q????ûl, ?????, e.g. ????? a coating of metal,

?????  requital, ??? ?? drink,
??? ?? detestable thing; with concrete meaning ????? a disciple, ????? strong; frequently in the
plural in an abstract sense, as ???????? reproach, ???????? filling (the induction of a priest), ?????????
consolations, compassion, ?????? ?? bereavement, ?????? ?? dismissal, ?????? ?? observance.

Nouns with the Third Consonant repeated.

29. The ground-form q????l, e.g. ?????? ?? quiet, fem. ???????? ?? (with sharpening of the second

Nûn, in order to keep the preceding vowel short); ???????? green, plur. ??????????.

30. The ground-form q??l??l, in Hebrew ???????; of this form are e.g. the infinitives Pi?l?l

(prop. Pa?l?l), cf. § 55 d.

31. The ground-form q??l?l; so the plur. ?????????? ridges (with sharpening of the Nûn, as in

No. 29).

32. The ground-form q???l?l, in ??????? a brood.

33. The ground-form q??l?l, in ??????? faint.

34. The ground-form q??l??l, e.g. ???????? plunder, ???????? rain-storm, ?????? ?? glittering tapestry,

Jer 43:10 Qerê; with attenuation of the ? to i ??????????? all that maketh black, Jb 3:5 (but the
better reading is ??????????).

35. The ground-form q??lûl, e.g. ????? ?? Jer 43:10 Keth.; ??????????? adulteries.

Nouns with the Second and Third Consonants repeated.

36–39. Qe??l??l, qe??l??l, qe??l??l; qe??l?ûl, qe??l?ôl (in fem. and plur. often with the last
consonant sharpened for the reason given in a above); cf. ?????????? crooked, ??????????? slippery
places, ??????????? cooked (ways); ????????? tortuous; also words denoting colours, ????????? (Lv
????
13:42, 49 in pause) reddish, fem.
qe?al???l, ?????????? very fair (to be read in Jer 46:20 for ??????); qe?al??l,
?????
syllable ??????????? offspring. Moreover, of the same form, probably, is ?????????? a trumpet (for
???????????, cf. § 55 e). Also in Is 2:20 ?????????????? is to be read instead of ????? ??????? (from the sing.
??????????? a digging or burrowing animal, perhaps the mole). But ?????????? opening, Is 61:1 (ed.
Mant., Baer, Ginsb. ??????????), is an evident mistake due to dittography; read ?????? as in 42:7.

 (fem.) blackish;
 a rabble (augmented from ???? collected). From a verb ??? with aphaeresis of the initial

Nouns in which the Whole (Biliteral) Stem is repeated.

Naturally this class includes only isolated forms of the stems ??? and ??? (on ????????? see §

96 under ???). Thus:—

40. ??????? a wheel, and, with attenuation of the first ? to ??,  ???????

 (from ???); fem. ?????????

anguish (from ??? or ????); ????? (for kirkar) a talent; cf. also ????? a star (from k?wk?b, Arabic
kauk?b, for ???????), ???????? bands, for ?????????; ??????? probably a whirring locust.

41. ??????? infin. Pilp?l (prop. Palp??l) from ???; fem. ????????? a hurling (from ???).

42. ??????? perhaps a ruby (for k?dk?d), from ???.

43. ??????? the crown of the head (for q?dq?d), from ???; fem.

from ???.

????

??????

 a skull (for g?lg?lt),

44. ???????? girded, from  ??? ; ??????? a bottle, from ???; ?????????? fattened birds(?).

§ 85. Nouns with Preformatives and Afformatives.

These include nouns which are directly derived from verbal forms having

preformatives (Hiph???l, Hoph?al, Hithpa??l, Niph?al, &c.), as well as those which are
formed with other preformatives (?, ?, ?  , ? , ?), and finally those which are formed with
afformatives. The quadriliterals and quinqueliterals also are taken in connexion with
these formations, inasmuch as they arise almost always by the addition or insertion of
one or two consonants to the triliteral stem.

Nouns with Preformatives.

45. Nouns with ? prefixed. Cf. the substantives with ? prosthetic (§ 19 m), such as ????????

arm (Jer 32:21, Jb 31:22; elsewhere always ??????); ??????? a finger, ?????? a locust, ??????? fist
 a watch. In these examples the ? is a ‘euphonic’
(others mattock, or clod), ????? ??? or
prefix (Barth, ibid., § 150 b); in other cases it is ‘essential’; cf. especially the adjectives, ??????
deceitful, ?????? cruel, ?????? perennial (for ’aitan) [=the Arab. ‘elative’, used for expressing the
compar. and superl. degrees]. The fem. ???????? fragrant part1 (of the meal-offering) is a nomen
verbale of Hiph???l, answering to the Aramaic infinitive of the causal stem (’Aph??l), hence
with suff. ??????????? Lv 2:2, &c.

?? ???

????

46. Nouns with ? prefixed. Besides the ordinary infinitives of Hiph???l ??????? and ????????, of
Niph?al ???????, ??????? (for hinq.), and of the conjugations formed with the prefix ????, this class
also includes some rare nomina verbalia derived from Hiph???l (cf. § 72 z), viz. ???????
appearance (from ?????), Is 3:9; ??????? a swinging (from ???), [Is 30:28; ??????? a rest-giving, Est
2:18]; ??????? deliverance (from ?????), [Est 4:14 an Aram. form: cf. ??????? Dn 5:20]; perhaps also
?????? palace, from haik?l, unless it is borrowed from the Assyrian; see the Lexicon. Cf. also
????????? Ezr 4:22.

47. Nouns with ? prefixed, as ??????? oil, ??????? wallet, ??????? owl(?); from verbs ???, e.g. ????? a

living thing, ???? a range; from a verb ???, ?????? an adversary. Of a different character are the
many proper names which have simply adopted the imperfect form, as ????????, ???????, &c.

48. Nouns with ?   prefixed. This preformative Mêm, which is no doubt connected with ???
who, and ??? what (see § 37 and § 52 c), appears in a very large number of nouns, and serves
to express the most varied modifications of the idea of the stem: (1) ?   subjective, when
preformative of the participles Pi??l, Hiph???l, Hithpa??l, and other active conjugations. (2) ?

1 1 Or perhaps more correctly with Jacob, ZAW. 1897, p. 79, ‘declaration, ’ i.e. the
part of the meal-offering which ‘announces the sacrifice and its object’.

objective, when preformative of the participles Pu?al, Hoph?al, and other passive
conjugations, as well as of numerous nouns. (3) ?   instrumental, as in ???????? a key, &c. (4) ?
local, as in ??????? a drive for cattle, &c.

As regards the formation of these nouns, it is to be remarked that the preformative ?   was

originally in most cases followed by a short ?. This ?, however, in a closed syllable is
frequently attenuated to ??; in an open syllable before the tone it is lengthened to ? (so also the
??, attenuated from ?, is lengthened to ?), and in ????? shield (with suff. ????????) it even becomes
unchangeable â. But in an open syllable which does not stand before the tone, the a
necessarily becomes Šewâ.

The following forms are especially to be noticed: (a) ground-form m?q??l, in Hebrew

????

 a knife, ???????? (for ???????? by § 23 c)

???????,1 e.g. ???????? food; fem. ????????? kingdom,

???, ?????? the best (from mai??b); with ? (or ?) assimilated, ????? a bed; from verbs ???, ?????? a

developed to a segholate), fem. ??? ???? desolation; from a verb ???, probably of this class is ?????

(b) Ground-form miq??l (the usual form of the infin. Qal in Aramaic), Hebr. ???????, e.g.

cattle-drive, fem. ????????? war, ????????? a chariot (with Seghôl instead of ??, but in constr. st.
??????????

????? a shield; fem. ??????? a roll (from ?????), ??????? a curse (for me’irr? from ????); from a verb ???,

from ???, according to the Masora, ????? a refuge, with suffixes ???????? and ????????, plur. ?????????,
but, very probably, most if not all of these forms are to be referred to the stem ??? to flee for
safety, and therefore should be written ???????, &c. The form ?????, if derived from the stem ???,
would mean stronghold.—Cf. also
 faintness, developed to a segholate, probably from
??????, for m?r?kh from ??????, like ????? soundness of body, from ?????.

With a long vowel in the second syllable: (f) ground-form maq?âl, with â always

Niph?al, cf. § 52 c. Many of these participles have become substantives, as
???? ???? destroyer, destruction.

49. Nouns with ?  prefixed. Besides the participles Niph?al (ground-form n?q??l, still

retained e.g. in ????? for n?wl?d, but commonly attenuated to n?q??l, Hebr. ???????) and the
infinitive Niph?al of the form ???????, the prefix ?  is found in ?????????? wrestlings, Gn 30:8, which
is also to be referred to Niph?al, and ?????? boiled pottage (stem ???).

50. With ? prefixed, e.g.

???? ??????

 a flame. On this Šaph??l formation, cf. § 55 i.

51. Nouns with ? prefixed. Examples of this formation are numerous, especially from
weak stems, for the purpose of strengthening them phonetically (see Barth, ibid., p. 283), and
notably from verbs ??? and ???. They may be classified as follows:—(a) the ground-form
t?q??l in ??????? ostrich (?); from verbs ???, ? ???? a settler; fem.
the Hiph???l ???????) correction; from a verb ???,
thanksgiving, and ????? law, both from Hiph???l; from a verb ??? and ???, ???????? issues;
probably belonging to this class, from verbs ???,
(developed from ????? and ?????, from ????? and ?????).

??????  the south; from verbs ??? and ???, ?????

??????  a melting away

??????  confusion, and

 expectation,

????????

????????

(b) T??q??l, e.g. fem. ???????? and

??????????

 glory; from a verb ???, e.g. ??????? hope; (c) t?q???l,

e.g. ??? ???? chequer work; fem. ????????? deep sleep (probably from the Niph?al ???????); from a verb
???, ???????? correction (from the Hiph???l-stem, like the constr. st. plur. ???????? generations);
from verbs ???, ??????? praise, ??????? prayer (from the Pi??l of the stems ????? and ?????).

With a long vowel in the second syllable: (d) t??q?âl, as ????? the ocean, the deep (for
t??hâm; in Assyrian the fem. tiâmtu, constr. st. tiâmat, is the usual word for sea), unless it is to
be derived with Delitzsch, Prolegomena, p. 113, from the stem ???; (e) tâq???l (in Arabic the
usual form of the infinitive of conjugation II. which corresponds to the Hebrew Pi??l), e.g.
from a verb ???, fem. ???????? completeness; ???????? increase, usury, with a parallel form ????????; in
a passive sense, ???????? a disciple; (f) ???????, e.g. ?????? an apple (for t?npûa?); very frequently
used to form abstracts, e.g. ??????? a benefit (also ?????); from verbs ???, ??????? a treading down,
??????? a waving (like ??????? a lifting up, from the Hiph???l stem), ??????? a longing, &c.; very
frequently also as an abstract plural, e.g. ????????? perverseness, ????????? guidance, ??????????
bitterness, ?????????? and ????????? consolation; from a verb ???, ???????? toil.

Nouns with Afformatives.

52. Nouns with ? affixed. Perhaps  ?? ????

 amber(?), and probably ??????? iron, ??????? garden-
land (Seghôl in both cases is probably a modification of the original ? in the tone-syllable),
??????? bloom, cf. § 30 q.—According to Prätorius, ZDMG. 1903, p. 530 ff., al is an affix of
endearment in the proper names ??????, ??????? (little lizard?) ???????? (also

???????

?

).

????

53. Nouns with ? affixed. With an original ?m as afformative, ????? vestibule (although the

? in the sing. remains unchangeable), plur. ?????????; but in ????? a swarm of gnats, the ? is
radical. With original afformative ?m, ?????? (also ?????) naked (from ???), plur. ?????????? Gn 3:7,
parallel form ?????, plur. ???????? Gn 2:25.—To this class also belong the adverbs in ?m and ?m,

mentioned in § 100 g, and many proper names, as ????????, also ????????, and ???????? (patronymic
??? ???????), ???????, ???????, &c.; but for ??????? ransom (?), Nu 3:49, probably ??????? is to be read.

54. Nouns with ? affixed. The ? is added by means of a simple helping vowel in

????????

????????

 a finger nail; more frequently the addition is made by means of a tone-

Canaan, and
bearing ?, which in Hebrew is modified to Seghôl (as ??????? axe) or lengthened to ? (but cf. also
??????????? and ???????????); e.g. ??????? a possession, ????? ?? a table, ??????? an offering. From an original â
being changed into an obscure ô we may probably explain such forms as ?????? a pining away;
???????? (also ????????) a goad; ??????? hunger; from verbs ???, ????? pride,  ?????
????? ?? a coat of mail; from a verb ???, ???????? guile (the only instance with both ?   preformative
and ôn afformative)1; very frequently from the simple stem with an unorganic sharpening of
the second radical, e.g.  ??????
also ???????? pregnancy (for ?????) and § 93 uu; ????????? shame, for ?????????. Proper names occur with
the termination ûn, as ??? ????, § 86 g, and others.

 memorial, ??????? destruction (constr. st. ??????? and ???????), &c.; cf.

 noise, ????? a vision;

?

Rem. A large number of proper names now ending in ? ?? or ?? used to be classed as
nouns originally formed with the affix ???. The subsequent rejection of the final Nûn seemed
to be confirmed by the form ???????, once used (Zc 12:11) for ?????? (and conversely in Pr 27:20
Keth??bh ???????, Qerê  ???????
 for ??????? destruction), also by the fact that for ????? ?? the LXX give
the form ????µ?? or ????µ??, and especially that in patronymics and tribal names (§ 86 h)
a Nûn appears before the termination ??, as ????????? Gilonite from ????? and ??????? ?? from ???? ??
(modern name Sailûn). Wetzstein, however (in Delitzsch’s Commentary on Job, 1st ed., p.
599), explained the Nûn in ??????? as a secondary addition to the common old-Palestinian
????? , ????, ??????, &c.), and Barth (Nominalbildung, § 224 b) has since shown the
termination ô (
unsoundness of the prevailing view on other grounds: the rejection of the Nûn would be much
more likely to occur in the numerous appellatives in ôn than in proper names, and ????????? and
??????? ?? are due to the necessity of avoiding, for euphonic reasons, such forms as g??lô-??, š??lô-??,
&c.; cf. also ?????? ?? from ??? ??.

??

On the afformatives ? ??, ? ??, ??, ?? ??, see below, § 86 h–l.

Quadriliterals and Quinqueliterals.

55. ??????? barren, ???????? a flint, and the fem ????????? heat, &c., have probably arisen from the

insertion of a ?; ??????? a locust, ??????? an axe, ????????? a branch, Ez 31:5 (verses 6, 8 ???????),
???????? ?? (also ?????? ??) anxious thoughts, ?????? ?? sceptre, from insertion of a ?, which is common
in Aramaic. Cf., moreover, ??????? a sickle, ??????? vine-blossom; with an initial ?, ??????? a bat,
???????? a spider, ??????? a mouse, ??????? a scorpion, 1 &c.—Quinqueliteral, ?????????? a frog.

§ 86. Denominative Nouns.

1 1 The plurals ???????? flowers, Ct 2:12, and ????????? thorns appear to be formed directly
from the singulars ??? (cf. ?????) and ????? with the insertion of ân (which in ??? is
obscured to ôn). See Nöldeke, Mand. Gr., p. 169, Rem. 3; similarly, according to
Hoffmann, ‘Einige phöniz. Inschriften, ’ p. 15 (Abh. der Gött. Ges. der Wiss., xxxvi),
?????????? wares, Ez 27:14, 16 from
??(cid:31)???
.
1 1 Derenbourg (REJ., 1883, p. 165) infers from the above examples and a comparison
of the Arabic ?u?fûr, sparrow (from ?afara, to chirp), that ? was especially employed
to form quadriliteral names of animals.

??(cid:31)???

=

1. Such are all nouns formed immediately from another noun, whether the latter be

primitive or derived from a verb, e.g. ??????? eastern, immediately from
(verbal stem ????? to be in front).

??????  the east

2. Most of the forms which nouns of this class assume have already been given in

§§ 84 and 85, since the denominatives, as secondary (although in some cases very
old) forms, invariably follow the analogy of the verbal derivatives. As, for instance,
the verbals with a prefixed ?   (§ 85 e to m) express the place, &c., of an action, so the
denominatives with ?   local represent the place where a thing is found or its
neighbourhood (see e).

The most common forms of denominatives are—

1. Those like the participle Qal (§ 84a s), e.g. ????? a porter, from
??????  a vineyard.

herdsman, from ????? a herd; ????? a vinedresser, from

??????  a gate; ????? a

2. Those like the form q????l(§ 84b b), e.g. ?????? an archer, from

???? ??  a bow. Both these
forms (c and d) indicate customary occupations, inhering in the subject, like Greek nouns in
???, ????, e.g. ???????, ???µµ?????.

3. Nouns with ?   prefixed, denoting the place where a thing is (cf. § 85 e), or its

neighbourhood, e.g. ??????? a place of fountains, from
?????????? the place about the head, from
?????? cucumber. Cf. ?µ????? from ?µ?????.

??????

??????

; ????????? the place about the feet,

, ????; ? ?????? (for ?? ??????) a cucumber field, from

4. Nouns with the termination ? ?? or ?? expressing adjectival ideas: ??????? eastern, from
?????? ; ??????? posterior, from ????; ?????? exterior, from ???; probably also ????????? coiled, hence
coiled animal, serpent, from ??????? a winding; ??? ?????? brazen, from
????? ??  brass. Also abstracts,
e.g. ??????? blindness, from ?????. Cf. § 85 u.— With a double termination (ôn or ân with ??) ????????
reddish, ????????? a knowing (spirit); ????????? basilisk; ????????????? merciful [fem. plur.].

?? appears to be used as a diminutive ending (cf. the Syriac ??) in ?????? little man (in the

eye), apple of the eye, from ????1; on the other hand ?????? ?? adder, which was formerly
regarded as a diminutive, is properly an adjectival form from ??? ?? to rub (hence, as it were, a
rubbing creature); in the same way ??? ???? is a denominative from ?? ???? (=? ????), properly upright
(righteous people), and not a diminutive (pious little people, and the like); finally, ?????? ?? is
not lunula, but an artificial moon (used as an ornament), and ?????????? not little neck, but
necklace (from ?????? neck). Cf. Delitzsch on Ct 4:9.

1 [1 Cf. Barth, § 212; König, ii. 1, 413. Diminutives in Semitic languages are,
however, most commonly formed by inserting a y after the second radical, e.g. Aram.
????????, Syr. (cid:31)(cid:31)(cid:31)(cid:31)(cid:31)(cid:31)(cid:31), Arab. ????????? a very young man, kulaib, a little dog,
&c. Since Olshausen (§ 180), ?????? a little (Is 28:10, 13, Jb 36:2) has commonly been
regarded as an example of the same form, to which others have added ??????? ?? Is 3:18
(as though a foreign dialectical form for šumais, little sun), and ???????? 2 S 13:20, as a
contemptuous diminutive form of ???????; cf. Ewald, § 167, W. Wright, Arab. Gramm.2
i. § 269, De Lagarde, Nominalbildung, pp. 85–87, König. ii. 1, p. 143 f. The existence
of the form in Hebrew is disputed by Barth, § 192 d.]

5. Peculiar to denominatives is the termination ? ??, which converts a substantive into an
adjective, and is added especially to numerals and names of persons and countries, in order to
form ordinals, patronymics, and tribal names; e.g. ??????? footman, plur. ????????, from
???????? cruel, ??????? strange, from
?????????, plur. ??????????, ?????????;  ?? ????
fem. ?????????? and ????????, plur. ??????????; ??????? Hebrew, plur. ???????? and ?????????, fem. ?????????, plur.
?????????; ??????? ??? Israelite, from ????? ???? When the original substantive is a compound, it is
resolved again into two words, e.g. ???????????? Benjamite, from ?????????? (cf. on the use of the article
in such cases, § 127 d).

??????  below, fem. ???????? and
??????  strangeness, ??????? lower, from
 the sixth, from ? ?? six; ??????? Moabite, from ????, plur. ????????,

 foot;

??????

Instead of ? ?? we find in a few cases (a) the ending ? ?? (as in Aram.), e.g. ?????? (crafty, or,
according to others, churlish) if it stands for ???????? and is not rather from a stem ??? or ???; ?????
white cloth, Is 19:9 in pause; perhaps also ????? a swarm of locusts, Am 7:1 ( ????
hardly ??????????? Is 38:20, Hb 3:19; but certainly in proper names as ???????? (ferreus) Barzillai; 2
and (b) ? ??, arising from ?y, in ?????? belonging to fire (???), i.e. a sacrifice offered by fire; ???????
(prop. milky) the storax-shrub, Arabic lubnay.

 Na 3:17);

??

6. Abstract nouns formed from concretes by the addition of ??, ?[? ??] (§ 95 t), cf. our
terminations -dom, -hood, -ness, e.g. ??????? youth, ??????? kingdom (the omission of the Dageš in
?   shows that the Šewâ is weakened from a full vowel; on malik as underlying the present form
???????  cf. § 84a a); ???????? widowhood, from ?????? widower, ???????? widow. In Aram. this fem.
ending ?? (or ? with rejection of the ?) is a common termination of the infinitive in the derived
conjugations (cf., as substantival infinitives of this kind, ????? ???? the announcing, Ez 24:26,
and ??????????? the making of a league, Dn 11:23); in Hebr. ?? as a termination to express
abstract ideas (including some which appear to be directly derived from the verbal stem, as
??????? folly, ??????? a heating1) becomes more common only in the later books. It is affixed to
adjectives ending in ?? (see above, h) in ?????????? cruelty, and ?????????? upright position (Lv 26:13,
used adverbially).

The ending ?? ?? is found earlier, e.g. in ?????? ?? remainder, ?? ????? principium, from

????=???? (head) princeps. The termination ôth seems to occur in ??????? wisdom (in Pr 1:20,
9:1, joined to a singular; so also ??????? Pr 14:1, where, probably, ??????? should likewise be
read) and in ???????? Ec 1:17, &c., with the parallel form ???????? Ec 10:13.

1. The regular plural termination for the masculine gender is ?? ??, always with the

tone, e.g. ??? horse, plur. ?????? horses; but also very often written defectively ? ??,
especially when in the same word one of the vowel letters, ? or ?, precedes, e.g. Gn
1:21  ????????
3:18); but usually contraction takes place, e.g. ????????; ???? ?? crimson garments, from ??? ??.

. Nouns in ? ?? make their plural in ???? ??, e.g. ??????? a Hebrew, plur. ????????? (Ex

2 1 On ? ?? as an old fem. ending, see above, § 80 l.
1 1 [See a complete list of instances in König, Lehrgebäude, ii. 1, p. 205 f.]
REJ. REJ. = Revue des Études Juives. Paris, 1880 ff.

Nouns in ? ?? lose this termination when they fake the plural ending, e.g. ????? seer,

plur. ?????? (cf. § 75 h).—In regard to the loss of the tone from the ? ?? in the two old
 heaven, cf. § 88 d and § 96.
plurals

 water and

?? ??????

??????

The termination ?? ?? is sometimes assumed also by feminines (cf. ?? ???? women, §
96 under ??????; ???? ?? years, from ??? ??; ???????? ewes, from ?????), so that an indication of
gender is not necessarily implied in it (cf. also below, m–p).—On the use of this
termination ?? ?? to express abstract, extensive, and intensive ideas, cf. § 124.

The ending ??m is also common in Phoenician, e.g. ???? Sidonii; Assyrian has âni (acc. to
P. Haupt originally âmi, cf. § 88 d); Aramaic has ??n; Arabic ûna (nominative) and ??na (in the
oblique cases, but in vulgar Arabic ??n is also used for the nominative); Ethiopic ân. Cf. also
the verbal ending ?? in the 3rd plur. perf. (§ 44 l) and in the 3rd and 2nd plur. impf. (§ 47 m).1

Less frequent, or only apparent terminations of the plur. masc. are—

(a) ?? ??, as in Aramaic,2 found almost exclusively in the later books of the O. T. (apart
from the poetical use in some of the older and even the oldest portions), viz. ???????? kings, Pr
31:3, ????????? 1 K 11:33, ?????? the guard, 2 K 11:13, ?????? wheat, Ez 4:9; defectively ????? islands,
Ez 26:18; ?????? days, Dn 12:13. Cf. also ?????? carpets, Ju 5:10, in the North-Palestinian song of
Deborah, which also has other linguistic peculiarities; ?????? heaps, Mi 3:12 (before ?; cf. § 44
k); ?????? words (from the really Aram. ?????), Jb 4:2, and twelve other places in Job (beside ??????,
ten times in Job); further, ?????? Jb 24:22, ???????? 31:10, and ???????? La 1:4, ?????? 4:3.—The
following forms are doubtful:

(b) ? ?? (with the ? rejected, as, according to some, in the dual ????? for

????????

 Ez 13:18, cf. §

88 c), e.g. ????? stringed instruments, Ps 45:9 for ?????? (unless it is to be so written)3; ????? peoples,
Ps 144:2, and, probably, also La 3:14 (in 2 S 22:44 it may be taken as ????? my people; cf. in the
parallel passage Ps 18:44 ???; also in Ct 8:2 the ?? of ??????? is better regarded as a suffix); see
also 2 S 23:8 as compared with 1 Ch 11:11, and on the whole question Gesenius,
Lehrgebäude, p. 524 ff. More doubtful still is—

(c) ? ?? (like the constr. state in Syriac), which is supposed to appear in e.g. ??? ?? princes, Ju

5:15 (perhaps my princes is intended: read either the constr. st. ??? ??, which also has good
 Jer 22:14 (according to others dual, see § 88 c, or a
authority, or with LXX ???? ??); for
loan word, cf. ZA. iii. 93) read ????? ????????. On ????? and ?????, which have also been so explained,
see above, § 86 i.—??????? Is 20:4 (where the right reading is certainly ???????) must be intended
by the Masora either as a singular with the formative syllable ? ?? =bareness or, more probably,
as a constr. st. with the original termination ay (cf. § 89 d) to avoid the harsh combination

??????
?

??? ?

1 1 On the connexion between all these endings see Dietrich’s Abhandl. zur hebr.
Gramm., Leipzig, 1846, p. 51 ff.; Halévy, REJ. 1888, p. 138 ff. [cf. also Driver,
Tenses, § 6, Obs. 2].
2 2 So also always in the Mêša? inscription, e.g. line 2 ???? thirty; line 4 ???? kings;
line 5 ??? ??? many days, &c.
3 3 According to some this ?(cid:31) is simply due to a neglect of the point (§ 5 m), which in
MSS. and elsewhere marked the abbreviation of the plur. ending.
ZA. ZA. = Zeitschrift für Assyriologie und verwandte Gebiete, ed. by C. Bezold. Lpz.
1886 ff.

hasûfê š?t4; in ??????? the Lord (prop. my lord, from the plur. majestatis, ???????? lord), the ay was
originally a suffix, § 135 q.

(d) ? ?? a supposed plural ending in ?????=?????? gnats (or lice), and ????? ladder (supposed by

some to be a plur. like our stairs); but cf. on the former, § 85 t.

2. The plural termination of the feminine gender is generally indicated by the
termination ?? (often written defectively ???, e.g. ??????? song of praise, psalm, plur.
??????? (only in post-biblical Hebrew ????????, as in the headings of the printed editions,
as well as
 a letter, plur. ???????; ????? a well, plur.
???????. Feminines in ?? ?? form their plural in ??? ??, e.g. ???????? an Egyptian woman, plur.
?????????; and those in ?? either make ?????, as ??????? kingdom, plur. ?????????, Dn 8:22 (cf.
??????? cells, Jer 37:16), or are inflected like ??????? testimonies (pronounced ??dhewôth
for ??dh?wôth).

??????? ???  the Book of Psalms);

????????

???

It is only from a mistake or disregard of these feminine endings ??? and ?? ?? that some
words ending with them form their plural by the addition of ?? ?? or ???, e.g. ?????? spear, plur.
????????? and ????????; ????? whoredom, plur. ???????? (by the side of ????????); ??????????? widowhood;
?????? ?? pits, ??????? amulets (if connected with Assyr. kâsu, to bind), &c.

The termination -ôth stands primarily for -âth (which is the form it has in Arab., Eth., in
the constr. st. of Western Aramaic, in Eastern Syriac, and also in Assyrian; on the change of â
into an obscure ô, see § 9 q). On the other hand, it is doubtful whether this âth is to be
regarded as a lengthened and stronger form of the singular fem. ending ?th (cf. § 80 b).

How the changeable vowels of a noun are shortened or become Šewâ in
consequence of the addition of the plural endings is explained in §§ 92–5.

3. Words which in the singular are used both as masculine and feminine (§ 122 d),

often have in the plural parallel forms with the masculine and feminine terminations,
e.g. ??? cloud, plur. ?????? and ?????; and each form may be treated either as masculine or
feminine, according to the usage of the particular word.—But even those words, of
which the gender is invariable, sometimes have both plural forms, e.g. ??? masc. a
generation, plur. ?????? and ?????; ??? ?? fem. a year, plur. ???? ?? and ??? ?? (see the Rem.).
In these words the gender of both plural forms remains the same as in the singular,
e.g. ????? masc. a lion, plur. ??????? musc., Zp 3:3, ????? musc., Jb 42:16.

Sometimes usage makes a distinction between the two plural forms of the same word.
Thus, ?????? days, ???? ?? years are the usual, but ????? (only twice, in the constr. st. Dt 32:7, Ps

A difference of meaning appears in several names of members of the body, the dual (see
§ 88) denoting the living members themselves, while the plur. in ?? expresses something like

4 4 Prätorius, ZDMG. 1903, p. 525, regards ??????? as an instance of the affix of
endearment (cf. ???????, ???????) transferred to an appellative, but such an explanation is
rendered unlikely by the meaning of this isolated instance.

????????.

4. A considerable number of masculines form their plural in ??, while many
feminines have a plural in ?? ??. The gender of the singular, however, is as a rule
retained in the plural.

Undoubted instances of masculines with (masculine) plural in ??? are: ?? father, ?????
treasure, ???? and ??? cistern, ????? tail, ????? dream, ?????? throne, ??? and ????? heart, ???? tablet,
??????
 night, ???????? altar, ????? place, ???? skin-bottle, ??? lamp, ??? skin, ??? voice, ????? ??
table, ? ?? name, ????? trumpet.

Feminines ending in ? ?? which take in the plural the termination ?? ?? are ????? terebinth,
?????? terror (but also ??????), ??????? a cake of figs, ????? wheat, ??????? a brick, ????? (only in poetry) a
word, ???? se?, a dry measure,  ???? ???
 barley, and the following names of animals ??????? a bee
and ????? a dove; also, for ??????? fem. eggs, a singular ?????? is to be assumed. ??????? sheaf and ??? ??
year (see above, n) take both ?? ?? and ??; cf. finally
without the fem. termination in the singular

 an ear of corn, plur. ?????? ??, and

 concubine, plur. ?? ??????????.

5. A strict distinction in gender between the two plural endings is found, in fact,
???  bonae, ????????? musc., ????????

only in adjectives and participles, e.g. ?????? boni,
fem. So also in substantives of the same stem, where there is an express distinction of
sex, as ?????? filii, ????? filiae; ???????? reges, ??????? reginae.

Rem. 1. In some few words there is added to the plural ending ?? a second (masculine)

2. Some nouns are only used in the singular (e.g. ???? man, and collectively men); a
number of other nouns only in the plural, e.g. ?????? men (the old sing. ???? is only preserved in
proper names, see § 90 o; in Eth. the sing. is m?t, man); some of these have, moreover, a
singular meaning (§ 124 a), as ?????? face. In such cases, however, the same form can also
express plurality, e.g. ?????? means also faces, Gn 40:7, Ez 1:6; cf. ???????? God, and also gods
(the sing. ??????, a later formation from it, occurs only ten times, except in Job forty-one and in
Daniel four times).

§ 88. Of the Dual.

Cf. the literature on the Semitic dual in Grünert, Die Begriffs-Präponderanz und die
Bugle a potiori im Altarub. (Wien, 1886), p. 21; Brockelmann, Grundriss, p. 455 ff.

1. The dual is a further indication of number, which originated in early times. In

Hebrew, however, it is almost exclusively used to denote those objects which
naturally occur in pairs (see e). The dual termination is never found in adjectives,
verbs, or pronouns. In the noun it is indicated in both genders by the termination
appended to the ground-form,1 e.g.

??????

With nouns which in the singular have not a feminine ending, the dual termination
is likewise really added to the ground-form; but the latter generally undergoes certain

2. The use of the dual in Hebrew is confined, except in the numerals 2, 12, 200,
&c. (see § 97), practically to those objects which are by nature or art always found in
pairs, especially to the double members of the body (but not necessarily so, cf. ????????

 a pair of sandals,

It is not impossible that Hebrew at an earlier period made a more extensive and freer use

of the dual, and that the restrictions and limitations of its use, mentioned above, belong to a
relatively later phase of development. The Arabic literary language forms the dual in the
noun, pronoun, and verb, almost as extensively as the Sanskrit or Greek; but in modern
Arabic it has almost entirely disappeared in the verb, pronoun, and adjective. The Syriac has
preserved it only in a few stereotyped forms, with which such duals as the Latin duo, ambo,
octo may be compared. In the same way, the dual of the Sanskrit is lost in the modern Indian
languages, and its full use in Old Slavonic has been restricted later, e.g. in Bohemian, just as
in Hebrew, to pairs, such as hands, feet, eyes, ears. On the Germanic dual, see Grimm’s
Gramm., 2nd ed., i. p. 814.

1. The Hebrew language no longer makes a living use of case-endings, 1 but either
has no external indication of case (this is so for the nominative, generally also for the
accusative) or expresses the relation by means of prepositions (§ 119), while the
genitive is mostly indicated by a close connexion (or interdependence) of the Nomen
regens and the Nomen rectum. That is to say, the noun which as genitive serves to
define more particularly an immediately preceding Nomen regens, remains entirely
unchanged in its form. The close combination, however, of the governing with the
governed noun causes the tone first of all to be forced on to the latter,2 and the
consequently weakened tone of the former word then usually involves further changes
in it. These changes to some extent affect the consonants, but more especially the
vocalization, since vowels which had been lengthened by their position in or before
the tone-syllable necessarily become shortened, or are reduced to Šewâ (cf. § 9 a, c, k;
§ 27 e–m); e.g. ????? word, ???????? ????? word of God (a sort of compound, as with us in
inverted order, God’s-word, housetop, landlord); ??? hand,
king; ???????? words, ????? ??????? the words of the people. Thus in Hebrew only the noun
which stands before a genitive suffers a change, and in grammatical language is said
to be dependent, or in the construct state, while a noun which has not a genitive after
it is said to be in the absolute state. It is sufficiently evident from the above that the
construct state is not strictly to be regarded as a syntactical and logical phenomenon,
but rather as simply phonetic and rhythmical, depending on the circumstances of the
tone.

?????????

Very frequently such interdependent words are also united by Maqqeph (§ 16 a); this,

however, is not necessary, but depends on the accentuation in the particular case. On the
wider uses of the constr. st. see the Syntax, § 130.

2. The vowel changes which are occasioned in many nouns by the construct state
are more fully described in §§ 92–5. But besides these, the terminations of the noun in
the construct state sometimes assume a special form. Thus:

(a) In the construct state, plural and dual, the termination is ? ??, e.g. ?????? horses,

??????? ????? the horses of Pharaoh;

?????????

 eyes,

?????

???? ??????

 the eyes of the king.

Rem. The ? ?? of the dual has evidently arisen from ? ?? (cf.

???????? ), but the origin of the

termination ? ?? in the constr. st. plur. is disputed. The Syriac constr. st. in ay and the form of
the plural noun before suffixes (?????,
original ? ??, as in the dual. But whether this ay was only transferred from the dual to the plural
(so Olshausen, and Nöldeke, Beitr. zur sem. Sprachwiss., Strassb. 1904, p. 48 ff.), or is to be
regarded as the abstract, collective termination, as in ?????? (see f) and ????? (so Philippi, ThLZ.
1890, col. 419; Barth, ZDMG. 1904, p. 431 ff.), must be left undecided.

, &c., § 91 h) would point to a contraction of an

1 1 On some remains of obsolete case-endings see § 90.
2 2 The same phenomenon of the tone may also be easily seen in other languages,
when two words are closely connected in a similar way. Observe, for example, in
German the natural stress on the last word in ‘der Thron des Königs’; though here the
other order of the words (inadmissible in Hebrew) ‘des Königs Thron’ exhibits the
same peculiarity.

§ 90. Real and Supposed Remains of Early Case-endings. ? ?? local, ? in compound
proper names, ? ?? and ? in the Construct State.

K. U. Nylander, Om Kasusändelserna i Hebräiskan, Upsala, 1882; J. Barth, ‘Die
Casusreste im Hebr.,’ ZDMG. liii. 593 ff.

1. As the Assyrian and old Arabic distinguish three cases by special endings, so

also in the Hebrew noun there are three endings which, in the main, correspond to
those of the Arabic. It is, however, a question whether they are all to be regarded as
real remnants of former case-endings, or are in some instances to be explained other-
wise. It can hardly be doubted (but cf. h, Rem.) that the (locative) termination ? ?? is a
survival of the old accusative termination a, and that ? in certain compound proper
names is the old sign of the nominative. The explanation of the ?? as an old genitive
sign, which, as being no longer understood in Hebrew, was used for quite different
purposes, and the view that ? is a form of the nominative termination ?, are open to
grave doubts.

In Assyrian the rule is that u marks the nominative, i the genitive, and a the accusative,1
‘in spite of the many and various exceptions to this rule which occur’ (Delitzsch, Assyrische
Gramm., § 66). Similarly, the Arabic case-endings in the fully declined nouns (Triptotes) are:
-u for the nominative, -i for the genitive, and -a for the accusative; in the Diptotes the ending -
a represents the genitive also. In modern Arabic these endings have almost entirely
disappeared, and if they are now and then used, as among the Beduin, it is done without
regularity, and one is interchanged with another (Wallin, in ZDMG. v, p. 9, xii, p. 874;
Wetzstein, ibid., xxii, p. 113 f., and especially Spitta, Gramm. des arab. Vulgärdialekts von
Ägypten, Lpz. 1880, p. 147 ff.). Even as early as the Sinaitic inscriptions, their regular use is
not maintained (Beer,Studia Asiatica, iii. 1840, p. xviii; Tuch, ZDMG. iii. 139 f.). Ethiopic
has preserved only the -a (in proper names -hâ), which is, however, still used for the whole
range of the accusative, and also (the distinction of case being lost) as a termination of the
constr. st. to connect it with a following genitive.

2. As remarked above, under a, the accusative form is preserved in Hebrew most

certainly and clearly in the (usually toneless) ending ? ??, originally ?, as in the old
Arabic accusative. This is appended to the substantive:

1 1 This rule is almost always observed in the Tell-el-Amarna letters (see § 2 f); cf. the
instances cited by Barth, l. c., p. 595, from Winckler’s edition.

3. Of the three other terminations ? may still be regarded as a survival of the old
nominative ending. It occurs only in the middle of a few (often undoubtedly very old)
proper names,1 viz. ??????? (if compounded of ??? and ??), ??????? (for which in Jer 52:1
Keth. ????????), ??? ??????? and
 (otherwise in Hebrew only in the plur. ?????? men; to
???? corresponds most probably ???? in ???????), ??????? Gn 32:31 (but in ver. 32 ????????) face
of God (otherwise only in the plur. ?????? constr. st. ?????).2—?? ???? Neh 6:6 (elsewhere
???? ?? ), is the name of an Arab, cf. 6:1. On the other hand the terminations ? ?? and ? are
most probably to be regarded (with Barth, l. c., p. 597) as having originated on
Hebrew soil in order to emphasize the constr. st., on the analogy of the constr. st. of
terms expressing relationship.

In view of the analogies in other languages (see b) there is nothing impossible in the view

formerly taken here that the litterae compaginis ? ?? and ? are obsolete (and hence no longer
understood) case-endings, ?? being the old genitive and ô for the nominative sign u. Barth
objects that the ?? and ô almost invariably have the tone, whereas the accusative ? ?? is toneless,
and that they are long, where the Arab. ?? and ? are short. Both these objections, however, lose
their force if we consider the special laws of the tone and syllable in Hebrew. The language
does not admit a final ?? or ?, and the necessarily lengthened vowel might easily attract the
tone to itself. On the other hand a strong argument for Barth’s theory is the fact that these
litterae compaginis are almost exclusively used to emphasize the close connexion of one noun
with another; hence especially in the constr. st. Consequently it seems in the highest degree
probable that all these uses are based upon forms in which the constr. st. is expressly
emphasized by a special termination, i.e. the constr. st. of terms of relationship, ?????, ?????, ?????
from ?? father, ?? brother, ??? father-in-law (cf. § 96). The instances given under l and m
followed this analogy.

Like ??, ? is also used only to emphasize the constr. st. (see o), and must therefore have a
similar origin, but its exact explanation is difficult. According to Barth, this ? corresponds to a
primitive Semitic â (cf. § 9 q) and is traceable to abâ, a?â, the accusatives of terms of
relationship in the constr. st., which have â only before a genitive. Against this explanation it
may be objected that there is no trace of the supposed Hebrew accusatives ????, ????, ????, and
only of the analogous ????. It is also remarkable that so archaic a form should have been
preserved (except in ????) only in two words and those in quite late passages. However we have
no better explanation to offer in place of Barth’s.

2 2The name ????? ?? formerly regarded as a compound of ?? ??=? ?? name and ???, is
better explained with Prätorius, ZDMG. 1903, p. 777, as a name of affection, for  ???? ??
???=?????? ???? [but see Driver on 1 S 1:20]; similarly, according to Prätorius, ???????= ??????
??? and many others.

 (Is 7:20). The

Finally we cannot deny the possibility, in some cases, of Barth’s explanation of the ? in

compound proper names like ???????, &c. (see above), as due to the analogy of terms of
relationship with nominative in ?. But this in no way militates against the view expressed
above, that in some very old names, like ???????, ???????, &c., the original common nominative
sign has simply been preserved.

The instances found are:

(a) Of the ending ? ??: ?????? ????? his ass’s colt, Gn 49:11; ?????? ???????? that leaveth the

?????

??? ???

?? ??????

flock, Zc 11:17 (cf. the preceding ????????? ?????); ????? ???????? the dweller in the bush, Dt
33:16 (on ???????? cf. below Jer 4916a, Ob3); appended to the feminine  ??????????? ??? ??????????
 whether stolen by day or stolen by night, Gn 31:39 (in prose, but in very
????????
emphatic speech); ??? ???? ?????????? plena iustitiae, Is 1:21;
 full of people, La 1:1
(on the retraction of the tone before a following tone-syllable, cf. § 29 e; in the same
, although no
verse the second ???? and
????????
tone-syllable follows; cf. also Ho 10:11 below);
 after the order of
Melchizedek, Ps 110:4; cf. also Ps 113:9, Jer 4916b. To the same category belong the
rather numerous cases, in which a preposition is inserted between the construct state
and its genitive (cf. § 130 a), without actually abolishing the dependent relation, e.g.
??????? ???
?????
provinces, La 1:1;
Ob3.—In Ex 15:6 ????????? can only be so explained if it is a vocative referring to ????, but
perhaps we should read ????????? as predicate to ??????????.

 she that was great among the nations,
?????

, see below, follow the example of
????
?????????? ?????????????

?????????? ???

????? ?????

?? ???

Further, the ?ireq compaginis is found with certain particles which are really also
nouns in the constr. st., as ???????? (=?????) except, ????? (poetical for  ??? ) from, ??????? not, ??????
not (thrice in the formula ??? ???????? ????? I am, and there is none else beside me; but
many take the ? ?? as a suffix here), Is 47:8, 10, Zp 2:15. [The above are all the cases in
which this ? ?? is attached to independent words in the O.T.; it occurs, however,
besides] in compound proper names (again attached to the constr. st.), as
??????????
(king of righteousness), ?????????? (man of God), ???????? (favour of God), and others (cf.
also the Punic name Hannibal, i.e.

 favour of Ba?al).

???????

????

????

Otherwise than in the constr. st. the ?ireg compaginis is only found in participial
forms, evidently with the object of giving them more dignity, just as in the case of the
construct forms in ??. We must distinguish, however, between passages in which the
participle nevertheless does stand in close connexion, as Gn 49:11, Is 22:16 (???????? and
????????, also in impassioned speech), Mi 7:14 (probably influenced by Dt 33:16), Ps
101:5, 113:7; and passages in which the ?? added to the participle with the article
merely serves as an ornamental device of poetic style, e.g. in the late Psalms, 113:5, 6,
7, 9 (on verse 8 see n), 114:8, 123:1.

In Kethibh the termination ?? also occurs four times in ??????, i.e. ????? ????, Jer 10:17, 22:23
 (or

(before ??), Ez 27:3 (before ????), La 4:21 (before ??). The Qere always requires for it
????
???), except in Jer 22:23 ???? ???; cf. ibid. ?????? Keth., ?????????? Qere, and finally Jer 51:13 ?????
Keth., ???????? Qere. Perhaps ????? ??? and ????????? are formae mixtae, combining the readings
????
&c. and ???? ???? (2nd fem. perf.), &c., but ??????????? may be merely assimilated to ????? ??? which
immediately precedes it.

????

,

The following are simply textual errors: 2 K 4:23 ?????? Keth., due to the preceding ???,
 as in the Qere; Ps 30:8 (read ????????), 113:8 (read ??? ???????), 116:1 (read

and to be read
??? ???, as in five other places). On ????????, thrice, in Lv 26:42, cf. § 128 d.

???????

????

(b) Of the ending ?1 (always with the tone): in prose only in the Pentateuch, but in
elevated style, Gn 1:24 ???????????? the beast of the earth (=?????? ????? ver. 25); similarly in
Ps 50:10, 79:2, 104:11, 20, Is 56:9 (twice), Zp 2:14; otherwise only in

§ 91. The Noun with Pronominal Suffixes.

Ungnad, ‘Das Nomen mit Suffixen im Semit.,’ Vienna Oriental Journal, xx, p. 167 ff.

With regard to the connexion of the noun with pronominal suffixes, which then
stand in a genitive relation (§ 33 c) and are, therefore, necessarily appended to the
construct state of the noun, we shall first consider, as in the verb (§ 57 ff.), the forms
of the suffixes themselves, and then the various changes in the form of the noun to
which they are attached. The nouns are also tabulated in the Paradigms of the flexion
of the noun in § 92 ff. Cf. also Paradigm A in the Appendix. We are here primarily
concerned with the different forms of the suffixes when added to the singular, plural,
and dual.

Rem. 1. There is less variety of forms in these than in the verbal suffixes; the particular

forms are used as follows:—

(a) Those without a connecting vowel (on the derivation of these ‘connecting vowels’
from original stem-vowels, see note on § 58 f) are generally joined to nouns of a peculiar
???
form (see § 96), the constr. st. of which ends in a vowel, as
????????, ????????,
93 x, y), e.g. ???????? the fruit of them, Am 9:14 (also ??????? Is 37:30, &c.), ??????? Jer 29:28 (also
??????? verse 5); cf., moreover, ????????? Lv 8:16, 25 and similar examples with ??? (Is 3:17 ???) Gn
21:28, Ez 13:17, 16:53.1 Also in Gn 1:21, 4:4, Ez 10:12, Nah 2:8, &c., the Keth. perhaps
intends the singular, ???????????, &c., but the Masora requires the plural with defective ê.

(b) The forms with connecting vowels (§ 58 f) are joined to nouns ending in a consonant.

2. In the plural masc. and in the dual the suffixes are to be regarded primarily as

affixed to the original ending of the construct state (
, cf. § 89 d). This ending,
however, has been preserved unchanged only in the 2nd fem. In most cases it is
contracted to ? ??, as in the constr. st. without suffixes (so throughout the plur. and in
the poetical suffix
 of the 3rd sing. masc.); in the 2nd masc. and 3rd fem. sing. it
is ? ?? (cf. k). On the 1st pers. and 3rd masc. sing. see i.—Thus there arise the
following

and the use of Seghôl instead of the more regular ?ere is to be explained from the character of
the following syllable,—so P. Haupt who points to
. In support
of the view formerly adopted by us that the ? is only orthographically retained, too much
stress must not be laid on the fact that it is sometimes omitted,2 thereby causing confusion in
an unpointed text with the singular noun. A number of the examples which follow may be due
to an erroneous assumption that the noun is a plural, where in reality it is a singular, and
others may be incorrect readings. Cf.
Jos 1:8, Ps 119:37; for other examples, see Jos 21:11 ff. (
???), Ju 19:9, 1 K 8:29, Is 58:13, Ps 119:41, 43, 98 (probably, however, in all these cases the
???
??????

orthographic omission of ? before suffixes cf.

3. The termination

??

????

 (also with the dual, e.g. Ps 58:7, 59:13), like ?? and

??

???

, occurs

with the noun (as with the verb, § 58 g) almost exclusively in the later poets [viz. with a
substantive in the singular, Ps 21:11, 17:10, 10, 58:7, 59:13, 89:18; with a dual or plural, Dt
32:27, 32, 37, 38, 33:29, Ps 2:3, 3, 11:7, 35:16, 49:12, 58:7, 59:14, 73:5, 7, 83:12, 12, 140:4,
10, Jb 27:23; after prepositions, see § 103 f, o, notes], and cannot, therefore, by itself be taken
as an indication of archaic language. On the other hand there can be no doubt that these are
revivals of really old forms. That they are consciously and artificially used is shown by the
evidently intentional accumulation of them, e.g. in Ex 15:5, 7, 9 Ps 2:3, 5, and 140:4, 10, and
also by the fact observed by Diehl (see the heading of this section) that in Ex 15 they occur
only as verbal suffixes, in Dt 32 only as noun suffixes.

3. It is clear and beyond doubt that the Yôdh in these suffixes with the plural noun
belongs, in reality, to the ending of the construct state of the masculine plural. Yet the
consciousness of this fact became so completely lost as to admit of the striking
peculiarity (or rather inaccuracy) of appending those suffix-forms which include the
plural ending ? ??, even to the feminine plural in ?? (
, &c.), so that in
???
?
reality the result is a double indication of the plural.1

???????

???????

????

,

Such is the rule: the singular suffix, however (see b), also occurs with the ending ??
(probably through the influence of Aramaic), e.g. ????????? Ps 132:12 (unless it be sing. for
????????, as, according to Qim?i in his Lexicon, ?????????? 2 K 6:8 is for ??????????); ????????? Dt 28:59
???
???????
(treated on the analogy of an infin. ???); ?????????? Ez 16:52. On the other hand
 (so Baer,
Ginsb.; but Opit.
???
??????????
??????  ) Ps 119:98, Dn 9:5 is merely written defectively, like
to Baer (not Ginsb.) in Pr 1:9, &c. In the 3rd plur. the use of the singular suffix is even the
rule in the earlier Books (see the instances in Diehl, l. c., p. 8), e.g. ??????? (their fathers)
oftener than ??????????? (this only in 1 K 14:15, and in Jer, Ezr, Neh, and Ch [in 1 K, Jer, Ezr,
however, ??????? is more common]); so always ????? ??, ????? ?? their names, ??????? their
generations. From parallel passages like 2 S 22:46 compared with Ps 18:46, Is 2:4 with Mi
4:3, it appears that in many cases the longer form in ???? ?? can only subsequently have taken
the place of ? ??.

 according

4. The following Paradigm of a masculine and feminine noun with suffixes is
based upon a monosyllabic noun with one unchangeable vowel. With regard to the
ending ? ?? in the constr. st. of the fem. it should be further remarked that the short ? of
this ending is only retained before the grave suffixes ??? and ???; before all the others
(the light suffixes) it is lengthened to ?.

1 1 See an analogous case in § 87 s. Cf. also the double feminine ending in the 3rd
sing. perf. of verbs ???, § 75 i.

§ 92. Vowel Changes in the Noun.

1. Vowel changes in the noun may be caused (a) by dependence on a following

genitive, (b) by connexion with pronominal suffixes, (c) by the plural and dual
terminations, whether in the form of the absolute state or of the construct (before a
following genitive of a noun or suffix).

2. In all these cases, the tone of the noun is moved forward either one or two
syllables, while the tone of the construct state may even be thrown upon the following
word. In this way the following changes may arise:—

(a) When the tone is moved forward only one place, as is the case when the plural

??????

 are affixed, as well as with all monosyllabic or

and dual endings ?? ??, ?? and
paroxytone suffixes, then in dissyllabic nouns the originally short vowel of the first
syllable (which was lengthened as being in an open syllable before the tone) becomes
Šewâ, since it no longer stands before the tone. On the other hand, the originally short,
but tone-lengthened vowel, of the second syllable is retained as being now the
pretonic vowel; e.g. ????? word (ground-form d?b?r), plur.
beginning with a vowel, ???????,
; plur. ???????,
an unchangeable vowel in the second syllable: ?????? overseer, plur. ?????????; with the
suffix of the sing.
an unchangeable vowel in the first syllable: ????? eternity, plur. ?????????, with suff. ????????,
&c.1

, &c.; with the suff. of the plur. ????????,

???? ; with a light suffix

, &c.; ????? wing, dual

, &c. With

??????????

?????? ,
??

???????

???????

??????

??????

????

????

???

???

????

But in participles of the form ?????, with tone-lengthened ? (originally ??) in the
second syllable, the ? regularly becomes Šewâ mobile before a tone-bearing affix, e.g.
????? enemy, plur. ?????????, with suff. ????????, &c. Likewise in words of the form ?????, ?????,
&c. (with ? in the second syllable; § 84b d, l, p; § 85 i and k), e.g. ????? dumb, plur.
????????.

(b) When the tone of the construct state, plural or dual, is carried over to the
following word, or, in consequence of the addition of the grave suffixes to the constr.
st. plur. or dual, is moved forward two places within the word itself, in such cases the
originally short vowel of the second syllable becomes Šewâ, while the vowel of the
first syllable reverts to its original shortness, e.g. ????? ??????? the words of the people,
??
??
syllable is attenuated from an original ?).

 their words (in all which instances the ?? of the first

 your words,

?????????

?????????

In the segholate forms in the singular and mostly in the dual the suffix is appended to the

?????????

ground-form (??????? my king,
, &c.); on the other hand, before the endings ?? ??, ??
??????  ) a Qames regularly occurs,1 before which the vowel of the first
(sometimes also before
syllable then becomes vocal Šewâ (????????, ???????). This Qame? (on which cf. § 84a a) remains
, &c.). On the
even before the light suffixes, when attached to the plur. masc. (???????,
other hand, the constr. st. plur. and dual, regularly, according to d, has the form ???????, with
grave suffix ??????????, &c., ??????? from

 folding-doors.

??????????

??????

????

(c) Before the Šewâ mobile which precedes the suffix ?? when following a

consonant, the a-sound, as a rule, is the only tone-lengthened vowel which remains in
the final syllable (being now in an open syllable before the tone), e.g.  ???????
,
????
&c. (on the forms with ? in the second syllable, see § 93 qq); but before the grave
suffixes ??? ?? and ??? ?? in the same position it reverts to its original shortness, as ?????????

?????

,
?

?

1 1 The participles Niph?al ????????? Dt 30:4, ?????? 2 S 14:13, and some plurals of the
participle Niph. of verbs ??? form an exception; cf. § 93 oo.
1 1 For the rare exceptions see § 93 l and § 97 f, note 2.

(debh?rkhèm), &c. In the same way the tone-lengthened ? or ? of the second syllable
in the constr. st. sing. also becomes short again, since the constr. st. resigns the
principal tone to the fenowing word, e.g. ???????? ?????;

 (from ?????).

???? ?????

????

Rem. The Masora (cf. Diqduqe ha-?eamim, p. 37) reckons thirteen words which retain
Qame? in the constr. st., some of which had originally â and therefore need not be considered.
On the other hand, ????? or ????? 1 K 7:6, Ez 40:48, &c. (in spite of the constr. st. plur. ????????);
??????? Ps 65:6, Pr 25:19; ????? 1 S 13:23 (so Baer, but ed. Mant., Ginsburg, &c. ?????); ??? ???? Ezr
8:30 and ????? Pr 18:16 are very peculiar.

3. The vowel changes in the inflexion of feminine nouns (§ 95) are not so
considerable, since generally in the formation of the feminine either the original
vowels have been retained, or they have already become Šewâ.

Besides the vowel changes discussed above in a–g, which take place according to the
general formative laws (§§ 25–28), certain further phenomena must also be considered in the
inflexion of nouns, an accurate knowledge of which requires in each case an investigation of
the original form of the words in question (see §§ 84–86). Such are, e.g., the rejection of the ?
of ??? stems before all formative additions (cf. § 91 d), the sharpening of the final consonant
of ??? stems in such cases as ???, ?????, &c.

A striking difference between the vowel changes in the verb and noun is that in a verb

when terminations are added it is mostly the second of two changeable vowels which
becomes Šewâ (?????, ????????, ???????), but in a noun, the first (?????, ???????, ????????), cf. § 27. 3.

§ 93. Paradigms of Masculine Nouns.1

Masculine nouns from the simple stem may, as regards their form and the vowel
changes connected with it, be divided into four classes. A synopsis of them is given
on pp. 264, 265, and they are further explained below. Two general remarks may be
premised:

(a) That all feminines without a distinctive termination (§ 122 h) are treated like
???????  m. king, except that in the plural
these masculine nouns, e.g.
they usually take the termination ???; thus ???????, constr. ??????? (and so always before
suffixes, see § 95).

??????  f. sword, like

(b) That in the plural of the first three classes a changeable vowel is always
retained even before the light suffixes as a lengthened pretonic vowel, whenever it
also stands before the plural ending ?? ??. All suffixes, except ???, ???, ???, ??? (???? ??, ???? ??,  ??
????, ???? ??), are called light. Cf. § 92 e.

Explanations of the Paradigms (see pp. 264, 265).

1. Paradigm I comprises the large class of segholate nouns (§ 84a a–e). In the first

three examples, from a strong stem, the ground-forms, m?lk, s??phr, q?dš have been
developed by the adoption of a helping Seghôl to
??????  (??

???????  (with ? modified to è),

1 1 A sort of detailed commentary on the following scheme of Hebrew declensions is
supplied by E. König in his Hist.-krit. Lehrgeb. der hebr. Spr., it. 1, p. 1 ff.

??????

 (? lengthened to ?).2 The next three examples, instead of the

lengthened to ?),
helping Seghôl, have a helping Patha?, on account of the middle (d, f) or final guttural
(e). In all these cases the constr. st. sing. coincides exactly with the absolute. The
singular suffixes are added to the ground-form; but in c and f an ? takes the place of
the original ?, and in d and f the guttural requires a repetition of the ? and ? in the
); before a following Šewâ this ?a?eph passes into a
form of a ?a?eph (????????,
simple helping vowel (?, ?), according to § 28 c; hence ?????????, &c.

?????

???

In the plural an a-sound almost always appears before the tone-bearing affix ?? ??

(on the analogy of forms with original a in the second syllable; cf. § 84a a), in the
form of a pretonic Qame?, whilst the short vowel of the first syllable becomes vocal
Šewâ. The original a of the 2nd syllable is elided in the construct state, so that the
short vowel under the first radical then stands in a closed syllable. The omission of
Dageš in a following Begadkephath (???????, not ???????, &c.) is due to the loss of a vowel
between ? and ?  . On the other hand, the pretonic Qames of the absolute state is
retained before the light plural suffixes, whilst the grave suffixes are added to the
form of the construct state.—The ending of the absolute state of the dual is added, as
a rule, to the ground-form (so in a–d and h, but cf. k). The construct state of the dual
is generally the same as that of the plural, except, of course, in cases like m.

Paradigms g and h exhibit forms with middle u and i (§ 84a c, ? and ?); the ground

forms maut and zait are always contracted to môth, zêth, except in the absol. sing.,
where u and i are changed into the corresponding consonants ? and ?.

Paradigm i exhibits one of the numerous forms in which the contraction of a

middle u or i has already taken place in the absol. sing. (ground-form šau?).

Paradigm k is a formation from a stem ??? (§ 84a c, ?).

Paradigms l, m, n are forms from stems ???, and hence (see § 67 a) originally
biliteral, yam, im, ?uq, with the regular lengthening to ???, ???, ???. Before formative
additions a sharpening, as in the inflexion of verbs ???, takes place in the second
radical, e.g. ?????, ??????, &c. (see § 84a c, ?).

Ginsburg) is probably not due to a confusion of the above two readings, but ?? is merely
intended to mark the vowel expressly as ?. In the forms ??????? Is 1:31 (for ???????) and ??????? Is
52:14 (for ??????? 1 S 28:14), the lengthening of the original ? to ? has been retained even

hence only with initial ?, ‘on account of its weak articulation’ (König, Lehrgeb., ii. 45). It
seems that by these different ways of writing a distinction was intended between the plural of
??????? caravan, and of ????? way; however, ?????? is also found in the former sense (in constr.
st. Jb 6:19) and ???????? in the latter (e.g. Jb 13:27 according to the reading of Ben Naphtali and

Is 10:17 (from

generally explained as a secondary form of ??????? with abnormal weakening of the ? to ??, is
more probably to be referred to a qi?l-form=Arabic ?iqq.

e.g. ?? nose, anger (????, dual
plur. ??????, for (cid:31)inz, probably also ??? green herb, for inb.

2. Paradigm II comprises all formations with original short vowels, whether in the

first or second syllable; cf. § 84a f–i, and the general laws of formation, § 92 b–g.

Rem. 1. On Paradigms a and b: ground-form q?t?l. The lengthening of the second ? to ?
is maintained in the constr. st. sing. only in ???-forms, e.g. ????? army, ?????. For the construct
forms ????? milk, ?????? white, Gn 49:12, instead of the ordinary absolutes ?????, ?????, a secondary
form ?????, ????? must be assumed; from ? ???? smoke, the constr. st.
? ??  occurs once, Ex 19:18,
beside ? ????, from ????? ornament the constr. st.

??????  Dn 11:20, beside the common form ?????.—

???

1 1 ??? only in Dn 12:7 as constr. st., since in the asseverative formulae (cf. § 149)  ???
???????, ?? ?????? ??? (otherwise only in 2 S 15:21, after ???? ???, and Amos 8:14), ??? is a
contracted form of the absol. st. (prop. living is Pharaoh! &c.). It is evidently only a
rabbinical refinement which makes the pronunciation ??? distinctive of an oath by God
(or of God by himself), as in the regular formulae  (cid:31)? ???
 (??????? ??? Dt 32:40) and ??????? ???
(=??????? ???).

???

The plur. ?? ??????? horses, Is 21:7 (instead of ?? ??????, ground-form p?r?š) is no doubt due to a
confusion with the qa??âl-form ????? horseman.

A. Sometimes a sharpening of the third radical takes place, in order to keep the preceding

vowel short, e.g. ???????? camels, ???????? small ones, ??????? brooks (see § 20 a).—The attenuation
of the ? of the first syllable to ?? does not take place in the constr. st. plur. as a rule after an
initial guttural, as ???????, ???????, but ???????, and never before a middle guttural, e.g. ????????; nor
(according to König, owing to the influence of the nasal) in the non-guttural forms ??????? tails,
???????, and (in the dual) ??????? wings, from ?????, ?????.—The dual
abnormal omission of the lengthening of the ? before a tone-bearing termination, but cf. § 88
c.

 from ????? river, shows an

???????

????

B. From ??? stems, forms like ?????, ?????, &c., belong to this class.

C. The few nouns of the ground-form q????l follow the same analogy, such as ????? heart,

??? ?? strong drink, ????? grape, &c. From ??? ?? hair, in the constr. st. besides ??? ?? the form
also found (perhaps a survival of a secondary form like those in Paradigm I, d); so from ?????
rib,
?????? ), both, probably, old
secondary forms (also used for the absol. st.) of ?????; cf. also ??????? and ??????, as well as the

2. On Paradigms c–e: ground-form q????l, developed to q???l; with a final guttural, e.g.
???? ?? satisfied. In the constr. st. the original ?? of the second syllable, probably on the analogy of
the forms discussed in § 69 c, becomes ?, e.g. ?????, ?????, ?????, &c., but not before suffixes, ???????,
&c., nor in forms from ??? stems, e.g. ????? full, ?????; cf., moreover, ????? Gn 25:26 from ?????
heel, and ?????? Ps 35:14, mourning. Paradigm d represents forms which in the constr. st.
instead of the ordinary ?????, &c., have a segholate form, as
constr. st. of ????? long, ????? wall, ?????? thigh, ????? robbery, ????? uncircumcised. In Is 11:14 ???????
would be altogether without precedent as a constr. st. (for
); most probably the absol. st.
is intended by the Masora (according to Nöldeke, Gött. Gel. Anzeigen, 1871, No. 23 [p. 896]
for ????? ??? with one shoulder, i.e. shoulder to shoulder); [cf. Driver, Tenses, § 190, Ohs.].

??????  (Ez 44:9),

??????? ,

????????

?????? ,

??????? ,

?????? ,

In the plur. constr. the ? lengthened from ?? is frequently retained in verbal adjectives of
this formation, e.g. ????? ??, ????? ??, ???????, ??? ????, ???????; cf. also ??????????? (with ? under the protection of
the secondary tone) from ????? tent-peg. On the other hand from ????? fearing, always ???????; cf.
also ??????? Ps 35:20 from ??????.—With ? retained in the initial syllable cf. ???? alius (with a
virtual sharpening of the ?).—From ??? stems come forms like ??? dead person, ??? resident
stranger, ??? witness, with unchangeable ??rÊ; hence ??????, ?????, &c.

Kindred in character are the formations from the ground-form q???l. This ground-form is

regularly lengthened to q???l, e.g. ????? round, ????? deep, ???? red; but before formative
additions the short ? returns, protected by the sharpening of the following consonant (see ee
above), as ????????, &c. (but in stems with a third guttural or ?, ???????, ?????? ??). The form ?????, 1 K
10:19, is abnormal; likewise ??????? Pr 23:27, Jablonski (ed. Mant. ???????, Baer and Ginsburg
???????).

3. On Paradigm f: ground-form q???l from ??? stems. As in verbs ??? § 75 h, the general
rule is that before the terminations of the plur. and dual and before suffixes beginning with a
vowel, the third radical is usually elided altogether. But besides ??? ?? the form ??? ??, with the
final Yôdh retained, is also found in poetry (cf. also the singulars with suffixes, like ?????? ????, in
ss); in the same way final ? is retained in ???????? the poor, constr. ???????. The plur. of ??? ?? is ??? ??,
constr. ??? ?? (also ??? ??, unless this is a sing., contracted from ??? ??; so Barth, ZDMG. xlii, p.

351). The q????l-form (see § 84a i) ????? 2 S 15:37, 16:16, 1 K 4:5 is remarkable as a constr. st.
(the reading ????? of Opitius and others is opposed to the express statement of the Masora). To
the category of these forms also belongs without doubt ?????? face (only in plur.), ?????, ?????, ????????,
&c.

In a few formations of this kind the vowel of the second syllable appears to have been
already lost in the absol. st. sing.; so according to the ordinary view, in ??? hand, constr. ???,
with suff. ????, but ???????; plur. ?????, constr. ?????, dual
, ?????, with suff. ?????, ????????, &c., and in ???
blood, constr. ???, with suff. ?????, but ??????? (? attenuated to ??), plur. ??????, ?????. But perhaps both
these nouns are to be regarded as primitive (§ 81), and as original monosyllabic formations.

????????

3. Paradigm III comprises forms with an unchangeable vowel in the first syllable,

whilst the vowel of the second syllable has been lengthened from an original short
vowel, and is therefore changeable. The special cases are to be distinguished in which
the original short vowel is lengthened both in and before the tone, but in an open
syllable becomes Šeewâ (Paradigm a, but cf. also examples like ????????? wheels, for
?????????, and ????????? porches), secondly, the cases in which the vowel becomes Šewâ
even before the tone (Paradigm b), and finally, those in which the termination of ???
formations is entirely lost (Paradigm c).

Rem. 1. On the model of ????? (which, moreover, is obscured from (cid:31)âl?m), the

following forms also are inflected: ??????? (§ 85 h), in some cases with virtual
sharpening of the third radical (see § 20 a), as ???????? Jer 17:7, Ps 40:5, Jb 8:14, &c.;
??? nouns of this form maintain the Qame? in the constr. st. plur., e.g. ????????? from
???????1; on the other hand, in the plur. of the participles Niph. (§ 85 n) of verbs ????
(which likewise belong to this class), are found not only regular forms like ?????????? but
)
????????
also ?????????? Jos 10:17, ?????????? Ez 20:30 f., and so always ???????? (except Ez 13:2
and ?????????? 1 S 13:15, 2 K 14:14, &c. (except Ezr 8:25 ????????????? in pause).1

???

Moreover, the other participles in ? also follow the analogy of

?????  as regards the final

syllable (???????, ???????; cf., however, ? ?????? Gn 43:12 in close connexion; see the analogous
cases in § 65 d); also ????? ?? table (§ 85 u; plur. ??????? ??, constr. ??????? ??), ???????, constr. ???????, hence
in plur. constr. with suff. ???????????? Lv 7:38; ??????? (§ 85 w), plur. ?????????? (with sharpening of the
final consonant for ??????????, cf. also ?????? naked, plur. ????????? Gn 3:7 [but in 2:25 ????????,
according to § 9 o an orthographic licence for
28:15; ???????, ????????; ?????????? Is 51:10; ????????? Is 23:8 f.; ????? ???? Ps 18:3; even with attenuation of
the ? to ??, ????????? threshing instruments, 2 S 24:22, 1 Ch 21:23, from ?????), ????? (§ 85 g), ????? (§
85 i), ????? (§ 85 k), inasmuch as they retain the ? of the first syllable, contrary to rule, even
when not pretonic, e.g. ????????, ????????; ? ???? (§ 85 g); ? ???? (§ 85 p), constr. st. plur. ??? ???? 1 K,
17:1; also isolated forms according to § 84a t, and § 84b b, c, k, m, n, o. Cf. finally, ?????? neck

??????  from ?????, ??????????? nakedness, 2 Ch

??

2. (Paradigm b; cf. § 84a s.) Instead of the original ?? in such forms as

????????  (cf. 2 K

??

22:29), the second syllable more frequently has ?, e.g.
guttural (according to § 91 d; but cf. also ????? Dt 32:28) forms are found sometimes like

??????  thy creator; with a closing

???

1 1 ???? ???????? Ez 7:24 for ???????? (from ???????) is wholly irregular; perhaps, however, the
part. Pi(cid:31)?l is intended, without Dageš in the ? (according to § 20 m).
1 1 Brockelmann, Grundriss, p. 659, observes that except in 2 Ch 5:11, 35:17 ????????????
is always followed by a preposition governing a word, so that the punctuators perhaps
intended to indicate a sort of constr. st.

 Ps 94:9 (according to § 65 d);
??
????
?????  Is 48:17; cf. 43:14.—The same analogy also is followed in the

?????????, sometimes like ?????????; constr. st. without suff.
with a middle guttural
???
flexion of the other participles which have ? in the final syllable (???????, ?????????, &c.), see
further, in § 84b d, ?????, &c. (but with exceptions, as ?? ???? ??, ????????), and ibid. l, p; § 85 i, k
(???????? altar, constr. st. ???????, plur. ?????????), and ibid. q, but here also there are exceptions like
?????????? Ps 26:12. ??????? Jer 5:5,
König, ii. 109).

 Ex 20:5, ??????? Is 49:8, ???????? La 1:16 (cf.

???? ?????

?????? ,

??

3. (Paradigm c: part. Qal of verbs ???, differing from Paradigm II, f in the
unchangeableness of the vowel of the first syllable.) In Ez 17:15 ? in the absol. st. is
abnormal, and Seghôl in the constr. st. in 2 S 24:11 (so Opitius, Ginsburg; but Baer ?????), Ec
2:15 (according to Baer, but not the Mantua ed.; ??????? Ec 3:19 is in the absol. st.). To this
class belong, as regards their formation, the ???-forms mentioned in § 84a r, § 85 g (with suff.,
e.g. ??????????? Dt 20:1, which brought thee up), and h.

In a few instances, before a suffix beginning with a consonant, the original ?y of the
termination has been contracted to ê, and thus there arise forms which have apparently plural
suffixes; as ?????? ???? Is 5:12, Dn 1:10, 16; ?????????? their appearance, Dn 1:15, Gn 41:21, cf. Na
2:5; ????????? who stretched them forth, Is 42:5; defectively ???????? Ho 7:5 (cf. ??????? Ez 34:14); on
the other hand, the examples in Is 14:11, Gn 47:17, which were formerly classed with the
???????
above, are really plurals. But
??????????
????
cattle, Is 30:23 (probably also
?? ??????
41:1 (with the ? here retained orthographically), ????????? Ez 40:31, &c., are still to be explained
as singulars.—On a few other examples which may perhaps be thus explained, see § 124 k.
Before the plural ending the original termination ay reappears in ?????????? Is 25:6 (part. Pu.
from ?????).

 Ct 2:14, and ??????? the sight of him, Jb

???

4. Paradigm IV comprises the forms with a changeable vowel (a, b), or a vowel
which has already become Šewâ (c), in the first syllable, and an unchangeable vowel
in the second. With Paradigm c (which, however, for the most part consists merely of
forms based on analogy, without biblical parallels) are also connected all the forms
which have unchangeable vowels in both syllables, and therefore (like ?????) cannot
undergo any vowel changes.

2. ????? (ground-form (cid:31)?n??y, stem ?????) represents forms in which a final Yôdh has been
resolved into ??; before formative additions the original Yôdh under the protection of a Dageš
forte again becomes audible as a firm consonant, whilst the (originally short) vowel of the
first Syllable becomes Šeuâ; cf. § 84a l, ?????, plur. ????????, and § 87 a.

3. ????? with unchangeable â in the second syllable, whilst the Šeuâ is weakened from a
short vowel (Arab. k??tâb); constr. st. ??????? Est 4:8 (readings like ????? 2 Ch 35:4 are incorrect,
although ????? Est 1:4 and ?????? 4:8 are supported by fairly good authority; however, these qe?âl-
forms in Hebrew are probably all loan-words from the Aramaic). The only plural form found
in the O. T. is ??????????? their deeds, Ec 9:1. In a narrower sense the forms enumerated in § 84a
n–p belong to this class; in a wider sense all those which have unchangeable vowels

throughout, thus § 84a u, § 84b e (?????, cf., however, the anomalous forms mentioned there),
ibid. f–i, m (No. 34 f.), n (No. 39), p (No. 44), also partly § 85 b–w (especially l and r).

In opposition to the anomalous shortening of the form ????? (see above), cases are also
found where pretonic vowels are retained even in the antepenultima (with the secondary
tone); cf. above, ii and pp, also of the form ?????? (properly q????l) the examples ??????????, ??????????,
?? ?????? ??, whilst the constr. st. sing. according to the rule, changes the ?into Sewâ (??????, ??????).
(These are not to be confounded with forms like ?????? tyrant, which is for ??????, and
consequently has an unchangeable Qame?.) Of the form ????? (q??ûl) in this class are ???? ??
week, plur. ??????? ?? and ?????? ??, constr. ????? ??, but with Metheg of the secondary tone in the
fifth syllable from the end, ???????????? ??.—On ?????, ????????, &c., cf. § 85 k.

§ 94. Formation of Feminine Nouns.

1. The feminine ending ? ??, when appended to the masculine forms treated in § 93,

effects in almost all cases the same changes as are produced in the masculine forms
by the addition of a light suffix, since in both cases the tone is moved one place
farther forward (see § 92 b). The following scheme is based on the same division into
four classes, with their subdivisions, as in § 93; a few special forms will be treated in
§ 95 in connexion with the paradigms of feminine nouns.

Paradigm I: segholate forms, with the feminine ending always added to the

); (d) ???????? girl (

?????? ); ??????? pleasure (

ground-form, (a) ??????? queen, ? ??????, and with attenuation of ? to ?? ? ?????? lamb, ??????? hot
stone, Is 6:6 (from another root ????????; see Baer on Ez 40:17), ??????? strength (unless
belonging to Paradigm b); (b) ??????? covering (masc.
be confounded with the unchangeable forms with a prefixed ?  , derived from ???
stems, as ??????? command, plur. ??????; (c) ???????, proper name (
(
?????? ); (f) ? ?????? weed,
??????
?????, Paradigm i); (i) ?????? victuals (masc.
forms, ?????? understanding, ????? tempest; (k) ?????? fat tail (as if from ?????), ????? ?? (?
attenuated to ??) captivity
????? measure (attenuated from ?????). Adjectives derived from ??? stems also belong in
flexion to this class, as ????? multa, with middle guttural ????? mala; (m)  ?????  plan; (n)
?????statute (???).

???

); (g) ??????? wrong (also

, ??????? wreath (probably an original qi?l-form); (l) ????? life,

?????  purity (
??????

?????? ), not to

??????

??????

??? ??(

Paradigm II: ground-form q???l?t, &c., (a) ??????? vengeance (?????); (b) ??????? earth;

(c) ??????? corpse; (d) ??????? languida; (f) ????? beautiful, ????? end (from ?????, ?????). From
stems ??? arise such forms as
witness. From the ground-form q?t?l, ??????? profunda (masc. ?????), ??????? servitude, &c.

?????  (masc. ???, properly part. Qal from ???) female

Paradigm III: unchangeable vowel in the first, changeable in the second syllable,
????????  a woman with child (cf. the examples in § 84a s, and the retention of the ? in

(a)
the part. Pi(cid:31)?l, Ex 22:17, 23:26; in the Hithpa(cid:31)?l 1 K 14:5 f.), but also with the
change of the ? (originally ??) into Šewâ, ??? ???? dwelling, Na 3:8. However, in these
participial forms the feminine is mostly indicated by ? ?? (see below, h); (c) ????? those
of the captivity (masc. ?????), but also with a return of the final Yôdh, ???????? clamorous,
Pr 7:11, and the examples in § 75 v. On the â of the participles of verbs ???, which
also belong to this class, such as ????? peregrina, cf. § 72 g

Paradigm IV: originally changeable vowel in the first syllable, unchangeable in
the second, (a) ??????? magna, ???????? stork, properly pia; ??????? virgin, properly seiuncta;
(b) ??????? misera.

2. A simple ? is added as feminine ending in forms like ?????? weeping (masc. ?????, §

93 x, a), ?????? covenant; but feminine participles of verbs ???, as
?????? , ??????, may be
due to contraction from yô?èet, &c. (hardly to lengthening of the ?? in the ground-form
mô?i), whilst forms like ????????, ???? ???? (see § 74 i) are to be explained on the analogy of
the forms treated in § 93 t. Apart from the ??? formations, we find the simple ? in the
participle ??? ???? 1 K 1:15, contracted from
??????  Gn 16:11, Ju 13:5, 7 is the
ground-form of the ptcp.
80 d and the Qere ???? ??, &c., discussed in § 90 n.

????
 (as in the same connexion in Gn 17:19, Is 7:14), cf. §

??????????

. But

??????

????

The forms which arise by appending the ? feminine to masculine nouns with a
changeable vowel in a closed final syllable are, as a rule, developed exactly in the
same way as masculine segholate forms. Thus there arise in Paradigm I (a) from ????????
(for original gebirt; § 69 c), the form
??? ???
47:7 also
queen (in Paradigm II, a);
???????? = gedirt; cf. ????? as construct st. of ?????); on the other hand,
???????? five, with lengthening of the original ?? of ?? ??????.

 are to be taken together; the absolute st. is ????????); from ????????,

 mistress (but only in construct st.; in Is

??????  pit) Lv 13:55; (c) ????? wall,

??????  =

Formations with a changeable ? in the second syllable belonging to this class are

????????

 coat, perhaps also

 the constr. st. of
????? ??  bronze (from ?? ??????),

????????

e.g.

§ 95. Paradigms of Feminine Nouns.

In accordance with the general formative laws, stated in § 92 b–k, the following

cases have chiefly to be considered in the flexion of feminines also: (1) a tone-
lengthened vowel on the removal of the tone reverts to its original shortness (thus the
? of the termination ? ?? becomes again ? in the construct st. ? ??). On the other hand,
even an originally short vowel is retained as (a long) pretonic vowel before the
endings ? ?? and ?? in the abs. st., e.g. ???????; (2) without the tone or foretone an
originally short vowel almost always becomes Šewâ; on the other hand, before a
vowel which had thus become Šewâ the ? in the first syllable which had hitherto also
been reduced to Šewâ returns, although usually attenuated to ??, e.g. ??????? from
??dh?q?th; (3) in the plural of the feminines of segholate forms before the termination
of ?? or ?? ??, and in formations of the latter kind also before the light suffixes, a

pretonic Qame? reappears, while the short vowel of the first syllable becomes Šewâ.
This short vowel, however, returns in the construct st. plur., whether ending in ?? or  ??
?; in formations of the latter kind also before the grave suffixes.

The following Paradigms (with the exception of I, d) deal only with such of the

forms treated in § 94 as incur some vowel changes or other. All forms with
unchangeable vowels follow the analogy of Paradigm I, d.

1. Paradigm I: feminines of segholate forms. (a) The locative of this class has the form
??????

????
no moans of deciding whether the form in question is to be referred to a q??l or a q???l base,
e.g. ??????? strength (cf. ??????? under b). A dual of this form occurs in
 seven times (cf.
??????  seven, fem.). Analogous to masculine forms like ????? (§ 93 s) is ??????? myrtle.—From
masculines of the form ????? (???, cf. § 93 I, k) arise feminines sometimes like ????????,
(see above, § 94 b), sometimes like ?????? (§ 94 f); occasionally the final ? is retained before the
plural ending, as if it belonged to the stem (cf. § 87 k), e.g. ???????? spears. Forms like ??????? (cf.
???????, a q??l form) are derived directly from the masculine forms ????? kid, ?????, a fleet.—(b) From
a stem ???, ????? wheat (for ???????), plur. ??????.—(c) From ??????? foreskin, the plur. absol. is ???????
(cf. ????????, § 93, Paradigm I, f), constr. ???????.—(d) Example of a feminine segholate form
from a stem ??? (ground-form q??l, like ????? of the form q??l,, ????? of the form q???l), with ? for

(e) To the list of segholate forms with ? fem. belong also the infinitives of verbs ??? and

???, which have rejected the weak consonant at the beginning, as
?????),
verbs ??? are, however, also found in the form ?????, ?????, ????, and of the same origin also are
????? congregation (from ?????), ????? counsel (from ?????), ??? ?? sleep (from ? ????), constr. ?????, ??? ??,
while in the constr. forms ????? sweat, Gn 3:19 (from ????? to flow), and ???? excrement, Ez 4:12,
the ?ere has remained firm.

??????  (from ?????); cf. § 69 m and § 66 b and g. The infinitives of

??????  (from ? ????),

From a stem ??? (cf. ??? to be ashamed) is

??? ??  shame, with suffix ??? ????. From a stem ???

(?????, cf., however, Barth, ZDMG. 1887, p. 607, who assumes a stem ???) the masculine ???
appears to have been formed after the rejection of the final Yôdh, and afterwards the feminine
??????  door; but in the plural ???????, constr. ???????, the ? of the termination is retained (see above,
d, ????????). In a similar way ???????? stalls, Hb 3:17, has arisen, if it is from the stem ???, and
????? trough (from ??? ??), of which the masc. must have been ??? = ??? ??; on the other hand, the
plur. constr. ?????? ?? Gn 30:38 (again retaining the feminine ? as an apparent radical) can only
??????
be an abnormal formation from the singular

, not from a kindred form

??????  or

?????? .

1 1 On ??? ?? as a less frequent (poetic) form for ???? ?? see § 87 n.
ZDMG. ZDMG. = Zeitschrift der deutschen morgenländischen Gesellschaft, Lpz.
1846 ff., since 1903 ed. by A. Fischer.

2. Paradigm II: ground-form q???l?t, &c., cf. § 94 c, Paradigm II, a and b. Analogous to

the masculine forms like ?????, plur. ????????, we find ??????? parva, &c.—The constr. forms, like
??????? (?idheq?th), are distinguished by the vocal Šewâ (§ 10 d) from the segholate forms, like
???????? (kibh-s?th). Consequently the constr. st. ??????? Gn 28:4, &c. (from ??????? blessing), and
??????? 1 S 14:15, &c. (from ??????? a trembling), are abnormal.—Under the influence of a
guttural (see Paradigm b) the original ? is retained in the first syllable in the constr. st. (cf.
also ??????? earth, ??????); in other cases it is modified to Seghôl, e.g. ??????? wagon, ????????.
Frequently from an absol. st. in ? ?? the constr. is formed with the termination ?, e.g. ???????
crown, constr.
the absol. st.;

????????
????????  (from ????? levir) before suffixes is pointed as in ?????????, and thus entirely
????

 (from ????????); along with ??????? assembly,

agrees with
this no doubt for an original ?mint, § 69 c) before suffixes ???????, &c.

 is formed ????? truth (from a?mant, and
)

 (Paradigm I e). From a stem

????????

????????

 (

From the masc. form ????? (q????l) are formed, according to rule, ??????? wall, ??????? corpse,

constr. ???????; ??????? cattle, constr. ???????? (for ????????), with suffix ?????????? Lv 19:19. More
frequently, however, the ? of the second syllable is retained before the termination ath of the
constr. st.; thus from ??????? once ?????????? Is 26:19, and always ??????? pool, ??????? prey, ?????? unclean,
?????????? full, Is 1:21 (with ?ireq compaginis, see § 90 l), ?????????? Jb 16:13; ???????? ?? 1 S 1:27, &c.
(with elision of the ?, ??????? ?? 1 S 1:17), also ???????? ?? Jb 6:8. Cf. the analogous forms of the
constr. st. ??????? plague, ????????? deep sleep, from ???????, ?????????.

As dual we find

the constr. st. ????????? is perhaps to be referred to a segholate form (???????, cf.
??????), unless the closed syllable be due to the analogy of ??????? and ??????? (see g).

 sides (cf. ???????? Gn 49:13, from the obsolete ???????, feminine of ??????);
???????  as constr. st. of

????????

????

In the forms with simple ? feminine the ground-form q????lt is developed (§ 69 c)

. Thus the feminine of ????? companion is

????????

 (with suffix ????????? Mal 2:14, cf. ??????? ?? Ex 3:22), of ????? fem.

to qe?alt, and this again regularly to
????????
???????.—Of ??? stems the segholate forms
this class; Böttcher (Gram. i. 411) rightly distinguished the latter from
corruption (stem ??? ??); in the same way also
??????  rest is distinct from
down (stem ?????).

??????  rest and

????????

 besides

??????
??????  a lighting

??????  pit (from ????, ????) belong to

The feminines of the form q????l from stems ???, as ????? mortua, ????? fem. witness (from
???, ???), have likewise an unchangeable vowel in the first syllable. Cf., on the other hand, the
forms from ??? stems mentioned above, under e, such as ??? ?? sleep, constr. st. ??? ?? ; moreover,
????? anger, constr. st. ????? (but
??????  a leathern bottle, in pause
??????  [so Baer, Ginsb., but Kittel
?? ???
???
???] Gn 21:15, constr. st.

 Gn 21:14, perhaps from a stem ???).

????

The feminines of the form q??u?l, like ??????? (masc. ?????), maintain the original ? by
sharpening the following consonant (cf. § 93 kk); on the other hand, by appending the fem. ?,
segholate forms arise like

cf. ??? ?????? La 3:7.

????

A few (aramaising) feminines from ??? stems (Paradigm II, c) are found with the ending

?th;, due to the rejection of the final W?w or Yôdh and contraction of the preceding ? with the
? of the termination ?th; thus ????? portion (for m?n?y?th or m?n?w?th), ????? end (also ????? and
?????), plur. ??????? (constr. st. Neh 12:47, 13:10) and ??????? (Neh 12:44); ?????? Ex 38:5; cf. 37:8
and 39:4 Keth.; on ??????? valleys, see § 93 v.—??? sign (stem ???) is obscured from ??, and

this is contracted from ây?th = ?w?y?th; plur. ?????, with the double feminine ending; cf.
above, f, and § 87 k.—The retention of the ? in the first syllable in ???????, &c, Gn 24:41, &c., is
abnormal.

3. Paradigm III, cf. the various forms in § 94 d and f–h. The dual

 two walls, Is
???????
, is abnormal (cf. § 87 s, and the

????

????

???????

22:11, &c., taken directly from the plur. ?????, for
proper name ???????????? Jos 15:36).—Among the forms resembling participles Qal of verbs ???,
such as ????? (masc. ??? from zâ??r, hence with unchangeable â), must be reckoned also ????? high
place (from ???), which has for its constr. st. plur. the pleonastic form ????????, or written
defectively  ???????
read b?mothê (not b?mothê), with an anomalous shortening of the ô to ??; but with suffixes
????????, &c.

 (see § 87 s); for this the Masora everywhere requires ????????, which is to be

?

In a wider sense the feminines of the form ????? (§ 84b e) belong to this class, in so far as

????????

 signet; also fem. of the forms ????? and ????? (§
 folly (for iww?lt), and of all the forms which have a changeable vowel

they shorten the â of the second syllable before the termination ?, e.g.
(from dall?qt), with suff. ?????????? Ez 16:52;
84b c and d), as
in the second syllable, and are formed with the prefix ?   (§ 85 g–k), e.g. ????????? kingdom,
;
constr. always
?? ????
reward, with suff. ??????? ????; cf. also the examples given in § 85 g and p, like
 birth (but
from ???, ??????? outgoing),

 generation, ???????? abomination, constr. ????????, &c.

; ????????? (not used in the sing.) pruning-hook, plur.

Sometimes the plural of these forms is to be traced to a secondary form, e.g.

 a letter,

plur. ??????? (as if from ???????); also ????????, which is merely formed on the analogy of the other
plur. fem. of participles Qal, is to be referred to a sing. ???????. Cf., moreover,
ploughshare, plur. ?????????? (as if from ? ?????????)1; on the other hand, ???????? capitals (of
columns), and ???????? reproofs, are the regular plurals of

4. To the fourth class, for which no Paradigm is required, belong all the numerous forms
which in classical Hebrew have unchangeable vowels throughout, the originally short vowel
of the first syllable having become Šewâ, owing to the tone being thrown forward. Of the
forms mentioned in §§ 84 and 85 those from ??? stems especially belong to this class, as ???????
scroll, ??????? praise, ?????? prayer (§ 85 i and q), as well as the feminine of the participle
Hiph(cid:31)??l of verbs ???, e.g. ???????? enlightening (from ??????), and generally the feminines of ???
stems which are compounded with the preformative ?  , as ??????? rest (from ??????), see § 85 l;
from ??? stems perhaps also ??????? conduit (constr. st. ??????? Is 7:3, &c.) and ?????? travail. Thus
all these forms coincide externally with those which already, in the masculine form, have
unchangeable vowels throughout (see the list of them in § 93 ww).

?? ????(cid:31)???

 Astarte (plur. ????? ????), which was formerly included among these

1 1
examples, is most probably due to an intentional alteration of the original
like
being substituted in reading for the name of the goddess.

??(cid:31)????  Lv 18:21, &c. (for

5. The feminine ending ?? ?? (apart from ???- forms like ??????, § 94 f) arises from the
addition of the feminine ? to the ending ? ??, which is employed to form adjectives, &c., see §
86 d, h, and k. The ending ??, mentioned there, is attached, in segholate forms, sometimes to
the ground-form, as ??? ???? Jb 12:5 (v.l. ??? ????), sometimes to forms with a loosely-closed
syllable, as ??????? kingdom; from ??? stems we find forms sometimes like ??? ?? captivity
(according to others from the stem ???, like
weeping, ????? exile, ????? vision; the latter retain the ? of the first syllable even in the constr. st.
and before suffixes. From a q????l-form is formed ??????? heaviness; from a q??a??l-form
&c.

?????  perverseness from ???), sometimes like ?????

????? ,

??

In the plural of these forms different methods of treatment may be distinguished. In some

cases the whole ending ?? is retained, as if belonging to the stem (cf. above, f), e.g.
from ????????, in others this ending is resolved, as in ????????? Dn 8:22 (no doubt for
m?lekhuwwôth), and ??????? (cid:31)?dhew?th, from ????? testimony, but only with suffixes,

§ 96. Nouns of Peculiar Formation.

In the following Paradigms,1 pp. 282 to 284, a number of frequently used nouns

are arranged, whose flexion presents more or less striking peculiarities. These
peculiarities, however, are almost always subordinate to the usual phonetic laws, and
the usual designation of the nouns as irregular is, therefore, not justified, when once
the groundforms are properly recognized on which the present forms are based.

?? father; the constr. ?????, like ????? and ????? (which occurs once), belongs to the connective
forms discussed in § 90 k, which serve as the model for the ?ireq compaginis. However, ??
also occurs in compound proper names, e.g. ??? ?????, beside ??? ????????, &c.; also Gn 17:4 f.

?? brother. The plur. absol. ????? has Dageš forte implicitum (§ 22 c); ?????? stands for ?????

according to the phonetic law stated in § 27 q, and so also ?????? in pause for ?????. The
sharpening of the ? merely serves to keep the preceding Patha? short, as in ????????, &c. (§ 93

1 1 Friedr. Delitzsch (in his Babylonian glosses to Baer’s text of Ezekiel, p. xi) on Ez
23:44 remarks that in Assyro-Babylonian the plur. of aššatu (woman) is aššâti,
corresponding, therefore, to ??????, not to the ordinary plur. ?? ????. The a of ?? ????
(instead of i as in Arab. or e as in Syr.) is to be explained with Barth (Orient. Studien
zu Ehren Th. Nöldekes, Giessen, 1906, p. 792) from the natural connexion of the ideas
‘men’ and ‘women’, ?? ???? and ?? ??????.
2 2 This disposes of the traditional view that the Dageš (after a firm Metheg, see § 16
 passing the night, ptcp. Qal of ???, a stem
??????
f ?) only serves to distinguish if from
which never occurs in the O. T. According to P. Haupt the stem is ?? to go in, ?
therefore being the feminine termination, as in bint daughter, and the original form
batu, b?tu (entrance) is preserved in the plural b?ttim where the tt is to be explained
as due to the analogy of trisyllabic stems. In the singular b?t passed into b?t (?), and
this was resolved into bait, as Yer?š?l?m into Yer?š?layim.

§ 97. Numerals. (a) Cardinal Numbers.

Brockelmann, Sem. Sprachwiss., p. 116 ff.; Grundriss, i. 484 ff.

1. The formation of the cardinal numbers from 3 to 10 (on 1 and 2 see below) has

this peculiarity, that numerals connected with a masculine substantive take the
feminine form, and those with a feminine substantive take the masculine form. The
common explanation of this strange phenomenon used to be that the primary form of
the numeral was an abstract noun in the feminine (cf. § 122 p). This was originally
attached in the constr. st. to the word qualified, then came to be also used in
apposition to it, and finally was placed after it like an adjective. The consequence of
the appositional, and finally adjectival, construction was, that for numerals connected
with feminine nouns a special shorter form came to be used, whilst the original forms,
with the abstract feminine ending, were used in connexion with masculine nouns,
after as well as before them.

On this view the historical process would have been that originally the abstract numerals

? ???

?????? ? ??

 trias filiorum,

(like Latin trias, decas, Greek ??????, ?????, &c.) were placed in the constr. st. before
masculines and feminines alike, e.g.
trace of this earlier usage was seen in the examples mentioned under c, like
Further, it was possible to say ?????? ? ??? ?? trias, sc. filii, as well as ? ??? ?? ?????? filii, trias. From
this second appositional construction it was only a step to the treatment of the abstract
numeral as an adjective, filii tres. Similarly the subsequently shortened forms of the abstract
numeral, which were used in connexion with feminines, might stand either in the constr. st.
before, or in apposition before or after the word numbered, thus ????? ?? ?? trias filiarum, or
????? ?? ?? trias, sc. filiae, or ?? ?? ????? filiae, trias, or adjectivally filiae tres.

 decas mulierum. A

A different and much more intelligible explanation of the striking disagreement
between the gender of the numeral and that of the word numbered has recently been
given by Reckendorf, Die syntaktischen Verhältnisse des Arabischen, pt. ii, Leiden,
1898, p. 265 ff. He also considers that the earliest forms were abstract numerals which
were placed in the constr. st. before the noun numbered, the latter depending on them
in the genitive. The original form, however, of the abstract numerals from 3 to 9 is not
the feminine, but the masculine, used for both genders, as it still is in the tens, 20, 30,
&c. The feminine abstract numeral was first distinguished by a special form in the
numbers from 13 to 19 (see further, below) when connected with masculines, and this
distinction was afterwards extended to the numbers from 3 to 10. This explanation
does not affect the view stated above that the appositional and adjectival use of the
abstract numerals was only adopted later in addition to their use in the genitive
construction.

The differentiation of the numerals (originally of common gender) into masculine and
feminine forms in the second decade, was occasioned, according to Reckendorf, by the use of
the abstract feminine ??? ???? in compounds. So long as it was felt that ??? ???? ?? ?? simply meant
the three of the decade, the gender of the noun numbered made no difference. When,
however, the consciousness of this meaning became weakened and the combination of units
and tens came to be felt as a copulative rather than a genitive relation, it seemed suitable to
connect only feminine nouns with the feminine form ??? ????. New forms were therefore
invented, both of the units and the tens, for use with masculine nouns. The former, however,

no longer had the form of the constr. but of the absolute state, clearly showing that the
consciousness of the original syntactical relation in ??? ???? ?? ??, &c., was lost. On the other
hand, after the extension of these new formations to the first decade, the new feminine forms
readily came to be used also in the genitive construction (and therefore in the constr. st.) on
the analogy of the earlier masculine forms.

Of the first two numerals, ?????, one, with its fem. ???? (see § 96), may be

recognized, from its form and use, as an adjective, although even so it admits of such
combinations as ????????? ???? unus e montibus. The numeral two, as would be expected,
appears as an abstract in the dual, but, like the other numerals, can also stand in
apposition to the noun numbered. In form it always agrees with the gender of its noun.
Accordingly, the numerals from 1 to 10 are as follows:

???????. In apposition, Zc 3:9, 4:2, cf. Jer 36:23. From what was said above, under a, it follows
that these cases are not a return to original usage, but only an intrusion of the form used
before masculines into the sphere of the feminine. Conversely in Gn 38:24 ?? ?????? ?? ?? (but in

2. The numerals from 11 to 19 are formed by placing the units, without the

? ???? ??

copula, before the number ten (in the form ? ???? masc., ??? ???? fem.), but without the two
words being joined into one. As was said above, under a, and as is proved by the use
of ????, ???? in the numeral 11, the feminine numerals from 13 to 19 are to be regarded
as construct forms in a genitive connexion. The connective forms of the masculine
, &c., are not admitted in combination with ? ????, since they are
abstracts, like
merely in apposition, and not in a genitive relation (see the rare exceptions at the end
of e). On the other hand ??? ?? and ??? ?? in the numeral 12 are undoubtedly true
constructs, like ???? and the fem. numerals 13–19. But instead of ??? ?? (Ex 28:21, Jos
3:12 and four other places) and ??? ?? (Jos 4:8 and three times in Ezek.), we generally
find ???? ?? and ???? ??. Two explanations have been given of these forms: (1) that the
Keth??bh really intends
?? ??????
case of
however, required ??? ??,  ?? ???
perpetuum (see § 17).—(2) that the absolute forms
analogy of ? ??? ??, &c.) were contracted to ???? ??, ???? ?? to facilitate the pronunciation of
the duals when closely connected with ? ???? and ??? ????, and that the contraction is
founded on an early and correct tradition. The second explanation is supported by the
large number of examples of ???? (66) and ???? (34). It would be strange if the
Masora required the alteration of the far commoner forms on account of isolated
instances of ??? ?? and ??? ??. As a matter of fact even in regard to the latter forms the
tradition often varies between ??? ?? and
?? ??????
cannot therefore assume a Qerê perpetuum.

4 4 In the vulgar dialects of Arabic, and in Ethiopic, the feminine form of the numeral

regarded in the abstract, as in the multiplicatives (see § 97 h).
1 1 ??? ????, which remained for a long time unexplained, was recognized (first by J.
Oppert) in the Assyro-Babylonian inscriptions in the form ištin or ištên; cf. Friedr.
Delitzsch, Assyrische Grammatik, p. 203, and P. Haupt, in the American Journal of
Philology, viii. 279. Accordingly, ? ???? ??? ???? is a compound, like the Sansk. êkâdaçan,
??????, undecim (analogous to the combination of units and tens in the numerals from
12 to 19), and is used at the same time in the composition of the feminine numeral

Very rarely the units appear in the masc. in the constr. st., as

S 19:18; ? ???? ???? ?? eighteen, Ju 20:25.—Connected by ?? we find ???????????? ??? ???? in Eze 45:12.

the plural here always stands for ten times the unit), thus, ?? ??? ?? 30, ????????? 40,

?????
50, ????? ?? 60, ?????? ?? 70, ?????? ?? 80, ???? ??? 90. But twenty is expressed by ???? ????, plur. of
???? ??  ten.2 These numerals are all of common gender, and do not admit of the construct
state.—In compound numerals, like 22, 23, 44, &c., the units may precede (two and
twenty, as in Arabic and English), e. g. Nu 3:39, 26:14. Very frequently, however, the
reverse order is found (twenty and two, as in Syriac, cf. French and English twenty-
two), e. g. 1 Ch 12:28, 185.1 In all cases the units and tens are connected by the
copula, ordinarily ??, but ??, before numerals with the tone on the penultima, ?? before ??, ?

expect (cid:31)as?r?(cid:31)m, šebh?(cid:31)?(cid:31)m, teš?(cid:31)?(cid:31)m. Is this very unusual deviation from the
common formation (see above, § 93 l, o, r) connected with the special meaning of
these plurals, or are these survivals of an older form of the plural of segholates?
1 1 According to the conclusions of König (De Criticae Sacrae Argumento, p. 61, and
Lehrgeb., ii. p. 215 ff.), the smaller number more commonly precedes in Ezek. and
the Priestly Code, but the larger always elsewhere. S. Herner (Syntax der Zahlwörter
im A. T., Lund, 1893, p. 71 ff.) arrives at the same conclusion by a full examination of
the statistics; cf. also his remarks on König in ZAW. 1896, p. 123, and König’s reply,

adding the termination ? ?? (§ 86 h), before which another ? ?? also is generally inserted
between the second and third radicals. They are as follows: ??? ?? second, ? ????? ??, ????????
(like
? ?????? (which, according to Strack, is always to be read for ????????), ???? ??,
???? ????, ???? ????. The ordinal first is expressed by ?????? (cf. § 27 w), from ???? head,
beginning, with the termination ?? (§ 86 f). On the use of ????? as an ordinal in
numbering the days of the month, cf. § 134 p; in such cases as Gn 1:5, 2:11, the
meaning of first is derived solely from the context.

The feminine forms have the termination ?? ??, more rarely (and only in the case of

part, ????? ???? and ??????? ???? tenth part. Side by side with these, in the same sense, there
are also forms like

CHAPTER IV

THE PARTICLES

§ 99. General View.

3 3 Cf. D. H. Müller, ‘Die numeralia multiplicativa in den Amarnatafeln u. im Hebr., ’
Semitica, i, Wien, 1906, p. 13 ff.

Brockelmann, Grundriss, i. 492 f.

1. The particles, which in general express the secondary modifications of thought

in speech, the closer relation of words to one another, and the mutual connexion of
sentences, are for the most part either borrowed or derived from noun-forms,
sometimes also from pronouns and verbs (§ 30 s). Primitive particles (apart from a
few demonstrative forms, see § 100 i) can only be so called in the sense defined in §
81 f.

2. So far as the origin of the particles can be discovered with certainty, they are

either (1) borrowed from other parts of speech; i.e. certain forms of the noun,
pronoun, or verb, with more or less loss of their original meaning, have come to be
employed as particles; cf. in the Indo-Germanic languages, e. g. the Latin certo, falso,
partim, verum, causa, the German statt, anstatt, wegen, weg, and the English instead,
away; or (2) derived from other parts of speech, either (a) by the addition of formative
syllables, as ????? by day, from ??? (cf., however, § 100 g); or most commonly (b) by
abbreviations effected in various ways, the extent of their mutilation being in
proportion to the frequency of their use, so that in some cases (see below) the original
stem has become wholly unrecognizable.

Cf. in German gen, from gegen, Gegend; seit, from Seite; weil (originally a particle of

time, like our while), from Weile.

Still more violent abbreviations occur in Greek, Latin, and the Romance languages, e.g.

???, ab, a; ??, ex, e; ad, Fr. à; aut, Fr. ou, Ital. o; super, Ital. su.1

The greatest shortening occurs in those particles which have entirely lost the
character of an independent word, by being reduced to a single consonant with its
vowel (generally short) or Šewâ. According to the laws of syllable formation in
Hebrew (§ 26 m), such particles cannot stand by themselves, but are united, as
prefixes, with the following word (§ 102), very much like the preformatives of the
imperfect (§a–d).

The view that this shortening of whole words to single letters has actually taken place in

the gradual course of linguistic development is rendered highly probable by the fact that
similar abbreviations in later Hebrew and in Aramaic, i.e. as the development of the original
Semitic speech progresses, become more and more striking and frequent. Thus the Biblical
Aramaic ??? becomes at a later period ??; in modern Arabic, e. g. hallaq (now) is from halwaqt;
lêš (why?) from li-ayyi-šai??n, &c. Cf. also the analogous cases mentioned above from the
Western languages. Nevertheless, the use of the simplest particles is found already in the
earliest periods of the Hebrew language, or, at any rate, in the earliest documents which have
come down to us.

3. Less frequently particles are formed by composition; as ?????? wherefore? for
?????????? quid edoctus? (?? µ????; ) or quid cognitum?; ????????? (from ??? and ?????) besides;
????????????

???????? ) from above, above.

 (from ???, ??,

1 1 Even short phrases are contracted into one word: Lat. forsitan, from fors sit an,
????????, ??????, Fr. peut-être, Eng. prithee from I pray thee.—In Chinese most of
the particles are verbs or nouns; e. g. iù (to give), also the sign of the dative; ?? (to
make use of), to, for; n(cid:31)i (the interior), in.

More frequent is the combination of two words into one without contraction, e. g. ???????????,

??????, ???????, ????????????; cf. also the compounds of ??? with demonstrative pronouns, as ??????????
from what?; ?????? ??? wherefore? [R. V. how]. See the lexicon under ???.

§ 100. Adverbs.

On demonstrative adverbs cf. Brockelmann, Grundriss, i. 323; on interrogative adverbs,
ibid., i. 328; on adverbs in general, i. 492 ff.

1. The negative ??? not, and a few particles of place and time, as ? ?? there, are of

obscure origin.

2. Forms of other parts of speech, which are used adverbially without further

change, are—

(a) Substantives with prepositions, e. g. ??????? (with might) very; ????? alone (prop.

in separation, Fr. à part), with suffix ??????? I alone;
??????? (as one) together,
corresponding to, like, &c., cf. § 161 b.

???????  and ????????? (originally in connexion with) near to,

????????

 from within, within; cf. also

(b) Substantives in the accusative (the adverbial case of the Semites, § 118 m), cf.
??????  (cessation) no more, ????? (the day) to-
??????  (union) together. Several of these continued to

??? ?????, ??????, e. g. ????? (might) very,
day (cf. § 126 b), ?????1 to-morrow,
be used, though rarely, as substantives, e. g. ??????, plur. ????????? and ????????, circuit, as
adverb circum, around; others have quite ceased to be so used, e. g. ????? (length) long
ago [Aram.: only in Ec.]; ??? (repetition, duration) again or further.

(c) Adjectives, especially in the feminine (corresponding to the Indo-Germanic
neuter), e. g. ????????? primum, formerly (more frequently ???????????, also ??????????); ?????
and ????? [both rare] multum, much, enough; ????????? wonderfully (properly mirabilibus,
sc. modis), ???????? Jewish, i.e. in the Jewish language.

(d) Verbs in the infinitive absolute, especially in Hiph(cid:31)??l, which are likewise to
be regarded as accusatives (§ 113 h), e. g. ??????? (prop. a multiplying) much [frequent],
????????? [rare and late] in multitude; ??? ???? (mane faciendo) early; ???????? (vespere
faciendo) in the evening.

(e) Pronouns and numerals, e. g. ??? (prop. there=at this place) here,

hither (also of time,
?? ??????

 till now, cf. the late and rare ????? and
?????? , ???? once, twice, seven times, a hundred times; ???? ?? for the second time.
,

??????

????

 here,
??????
???????? =???????); ????,

3. Some adverbs are formed by the addition of formative syllables (most

frequently ? ??) to substantives or adjectives, e.g. ?????? and ??????? truly (from ????? truth);
????? (by favour) gratis (from ??? gratia); ?????? in vain, frustra, but also empty, (from ????
empty, emptiness, vanum), Ru 1:21, parallel with the fem. ?????? full; ????? by day (from

1 1 Generally derived from the ptcp. Pu(cid:31)al ?????? me???r (=meo???r) and hence to be
read m???r (cf. ???????? morning); but according to P. Haupt (notes to Esther, p. 159)
from ???? ???.

???)1; with ô in the last syllable, ???????, for ???????, in a twinkling, suddenly (from
??????  a
twinkling, the ô being probably obscured from an original â).2—Moreover, cf. ???????????
backward, and ??????????? darkly attired, Mal 3:14. In both these cases, the formative
syllable an has been first attached to the stem, and then the feminine ending ??th, which
is elsewhere used to form adverbs, has been added to it.

The termination ? ?? occurs also in the formation of substantives, e. g. ????? porch, and
hence the above adverbs may equally well be regarded as nouns used adverbially, so that ? ??,
???  , would correspond to ? ??, ?? (§ 85, Nos. 53, 54), cf. ????????? (with prep.) suddenly, 2 Ch
29:36. According to others, this am is an obsolete accusative ending, to be compared with the
indeterminate accusative sing. in ?n in Arabic.

??????

4. A number of forms standing in very close relation to the demonstrative pronoun
may be regarded as primitive adverbs, since they arise directly from a combination of
demonstrative sounds. Some of these have subsequently suffered great mutilation, the
extent of which, however, can now very rarely be ascertained with certainty. Such are
 here (according to Barth, Sprachwiss. Abhandlungen, p. 16, formed
e. g. ?? then,
??????  thus (cf. ??????, ?????????, how?),
from the two demonstrative elements hin and na), ???,
??? only, ???? truly (on all these adverbs, see the Lexicon), and especially the
interrogative ?? (H? interrogativum), e. g. ????? (Dt 3:11 ?????) nonne?, ????? num etiam?
This H? interrogativum is perhaps shortened from ???, which is still used in Arabic,
and, according to the view of a certain school of Masoretes, occurs also in Hebrew in
Dt 32:6.1

The ? interrogative takes—(1) ?a?eph-Palha? generally before non-gutturals (even

before ?), with a firm vowel, e. g.
(???????? Lv 10:19 is an exception).

?????????

 hast thou set? see the interrogative clause, § 150 c

(2) Before a consonant with Šewâ, usually Patha? without a following Dageš forte, e. g.
?????????? Gn 27:38, cf. 18:17, 29:5, 30:15, 34:31; less frequently (in about ten passages), Patha?
with a following Dageš forte, e. g. ?????????? num in via, Ez 20:30,  ???????
Nu 13:19, Jb 23:6; even in ?, 1 S 10:24, 17:25, 2 K 6:32.

 Gn 17:17, 18:21, 37:32,

(3) Before gutturals, not pointed with either Qame? or ?a?eph-Qame?, it takes Patha?, e.

g. ????????? shall I go?, ??????? num tu?, ????? num si; ?????????? Mal 1:13; also in Ju 6:31 read ???????
(not ?????), likewise ?? in Ju 12:5, Jer 8:19, Neh 6:11.—In ?????? Nu 16:22, the Masora intends

 noctu), corresponding to the

1 1 Is this ? ?? an instance of the locative or temporal termination (cf. especially ????)
mentioned in § 88 c? Nöldeke, ZDMG. xl. p. 721, considers ????? a secondary
substantival form (used adverbially like
??(cid:31)?????
Phoenician and Aramaic ???, Syr. im?m?; cf. on the other hand, König, ii. 255, who
follows Olshausen in maintaining that the ?m is an adverbial termination.
2 2 ????? silent (an adjective in Is 47:5, La 3:26; a substantive in Hb 2:19), which was
formerly included under this head, is better taken, with Barth (Nominal-bildung, p.
352, Rem. 2), as a participle formed like ?????, ?????, so that ????? (perhaps assimilated
to ?????) stands for original ?????.
1 1 The separation of the ? at the beginning of Dt 32:6, expressly noticed by Qim?i
(ed. Rittenb., p. 40 b) as an unique instance, is perhaps a protestagainst admitting a
particle ???.

the article; read ??????, and cf. Dt 20:19; in Ec 3:21 read ???????? and ?????????; the article is a
correction due to doctrinal considerations.

(4) The ? takes Seghôl before gutturals pointed with Qame? or (as in Ju 9:9 ff.) ?a?eph-
Qame?, e.g. ???????? Mi 2:7; ????????? Jb 21:4; ?????????? Jo 1:2; ? ??????? Gn 24:5 (cf. the analogous
instances in § 22 c, § 35 k, § 63 k). The place of this interrogative particle is always at the
beginning of the clause [but see Jb 34:31, Neh 13:27, Jer 22:15, where one or more words are
prefixed for emphasis].

The usual explanation of these suffixes (especially of the forms with Nûn energicum) as

verbal suffixes, which ascribes some power of verbal government even to forms originally
substantival (e. g. ?? ???? there is, he is), is at least inadmissible for forms (like ???, ???????) which
are evidently connected with noun-suffixes; even for the other forms it is questionable.
Brockelmann suggests that the ? in connexion with these particles is a survival from ???
corresponding to the Arab. ánna which introduces dependent clauses.

§ 101. Prepositions.

viz.:

2 2 The most important of these differences are, (a) those between the Orientals, i. e.
the scholars of the Babylonian Schools, and the Occidentals, i. e. the scholars of
Palestine (Tiberias, &c.); cf. Ginsburg, Introd., p. 197 ff.; (b) amongst the
Occidentals, between Ben-Naphtali and Ben-Asher, who flourished in the first half of
the tenth century at Tiberias; cf. Ginsburg, Introd., p. 241 ff. Both sets of variants are
given by Baer in the appendices to his critical editions. Our printed editions present
uniformly the text of Ben-Asher, with the exception of a few isolated readings of Ben-
Naphtali, and of numerous later corruptions.

??

??? ???  Lv 14:36, Dt 21:13, 1 S 10:5;

(a) Substantives in the accusative and in the construct state, so that the noun
governed by them is to be considered as in the genitive, and in Arabic actually has the
genitive ending, cf. in German statt dessen, kraft dessen, in Greek ?????? ?????, in
Latin huius rei causa, or gratia, montis instar.1 Cf.

(b) Substantives in the construct state, but to be regarded as in the genitive, since

they depend on prepositions (especially the inseparable), e. g. ??????? (in the face of*)
before; ?????, ????? (according to the mouth, i.e. the command of*) according to; ??????? (in
the concern of) on account of;

 (for the purpose of) on account of.

§ 102. Prefixed Prepositions.

1. Of the words mentioned in § 101, ???? from, out of, frequently occurs as a prefix

(§ 99 c), with its Nûn assimilated to the following consonant (by means of Dageš
forte), e.g.

 out of a forest.

????????

Rem. The separate ???? (always with a following Maqqeph) is usual (but not necessary, cf.

????

???????

, and sometimes

Ju 20:14 with verse 15, Ez 43:6, &c.) only before the article, e. g.
occurs before the softer consonants, e. g. ?????? Jer 44:18, ????????? Jo 1:12, 1 Ch 5:18; cf. Ex
18:14, Lv 1:14, 14:30, Ju 7:23, 10:11, 19:16, Ps 104:7 (2 K 23:36 before ?; also before ? in Ps
18:49), and elsewhere in the later books (as in Aramaic)1; there is besides a poetic by-form ?????
(cf. § 90 m) and ????? Is 30:11. Its form is most commonly  ?? ·  with a following Dageš, which
may, however, be omitted in letters which have Šewâ (cf. § 20 m). With a following ? the ??   is,
as a rule, contracted to ???, e. g. ??????=??????? or ???????? (but cf. ??? ?????? Dn 12:2; ?????????????? 2 Ch 20:11);
before gutturals it becomes ??   (according to § 22 c), e. g. ???????, ?????; before ? the ??   occurs with
the guttural virtually sharpened in ????? on the outside, and in ????? Gn 14:23; before ? in ????????
(cf. § 28 b and § 63 q. The closed syllable here is inconsistent with the required virtual

1 1 In the examples which follow, the meaning of the noun is added in parentheses,
and, when it is actually in use [though it is mostly in such cases very rare], is marked
with an asterisk.—On a similar use in other languages, see W. von Humboldt, Über
die Kawisprache, iii, p. 621.
2 2 So also J. Hoch de Long, Die hebr. Präpos. ?????, Lpz. 1905.
1 1 König, Einleitung ins A. T., p. 393 (cf. also the almost exhaustive statistics in his
Lehrgebäude, ii. 292 ff.), enumerates eight instances of ??? before a word without the
article in 2 Samuel and Kings, and forty-five in Chronicles.

sharpening of the ?; probably ???????? is merely due to the analogy of ????????); similarly Is 14:3
before ?; but in 1 S 23:28, 2 S 18:16 ??????? is to be read, according to § 22 s.

2. There are also three other particles, the most commonly used prepositions and

the particle of comparison, which have been reduced by abbreviation (§ 99 c) to a
single prefixed consonant with Šewâ (but see below, and § 103 e), viz.:

?? [poet. ????] in, at, with.

?? [poet. ????] towards, (belonging) to, for, Lat. ad.

??   [poet. ????] like, as, according to (no doubt the remnant of a substantive with the

meaning of matter, kind, instar).

With regard to the pointing it is to be observed that—

(a) The Šewâ mobile, with which the above prefixes are usually pronounced, has resulted

from the weakening of a short vowel (an original ?, according to f)2; the short vowel is
regularly retained before Šewâ: before Šewâ simplex in the form of an ?, attenuated from ?:
before a ?a?eph the prefix takes the vowel of the ?a?eph, e. g. ??????? for fruit, ???????? as a lion,
???????? b?(cid:31)on??, in affliction (sometimes with the syllable subsequently closed, cf. § 28 b, and
the infinitives with ?? § 63 i): before weak consonants it follows the rule given in § 24 c, e. g.
????????? for ?????. When the prefixes ??, ??, ??  , ??, precede ???????? God, the Šewâ and ?a?eph Seghôl
regularly coalesce in ??rê, e. g. ??????????, &c., for ???????; so with suffixes ??????????, &c. (once
also in the sing. ???????? Hb 1:11); also regularly ?????? to say, for ????????, see § 23 d.

(b) When the prefixes precede the article, the ? is almost always dropped, and they take

its vowel. See further in § 35 n.

(c) Immediately before the tone-syllable, i.e. before monosyllables and dissyllables with
the tone on the penultima (in the fore-tone), they take Qame? (undoubtedly a lengthening of
an original ?, cf. § 26 e, § 28 a), but only in the following cases:

(aa) ?? before infinitives of the above-mentioned forms, as ????? to give, ?????? to judge, ?????

to plunder, ????? to shear, ????? to keep a festival,
except when the infinitive (as a nomen regens) is closely connected with another word
(especially its subject, § 115 e), and consequently, as being in a sort of constr. state, loses the
principal tone, e. g.
such cases as
of verbs ???, the ?? is retained even in close connexion; cf. Ez 21:20, 25, 22:3);

 Gn 16:3, and so always ????? ????? Nu 13:21, &c. (in
 Ex 5:21 the ? is protected by the secondary tone; before infinitives

?? is twice repeated, even before the small and smallest disjunctives;

 for the dead, Lv 19:28, Nu 5:2, 9:10.

(d) With the interrogative ??? they are pointed as in ?????; in pause and before ? as in ????? by
what? (before a following relative clause, as in Ec 3:22, ?????; cf. Delitzsch, Jesaia, 4th ed., on
Is 2:22); ????? how much? but also  ?????  1 K 22:16, in close connexion, and at a greater distance
from the pause. The Seghôl in these forms arises from a modification of the original ?, while
the ?   is sharpened in order to maintain the original ? of the prefixes.

When ?? (prop. la) is united to ???, it takes, according to § 49 f, g, the form

??????  (Jb 7:20

§ 103. Prepositions with Pronominal Suffixes and in the Plural Form.

1. As all prepositions were originally nouns (§ 101) in the accusative, they may be

united with the noun-suffixes (§ 91 b–l), e. g. ??????? (prop. at my side) by me, ????? (in
my proximity) with me, ??????? (in their place) instead of them, like the Latin mea
causa, for my sake.

Rem. 1. The preposition ??? (usually ????) near, with, is distinguished from ??? (see

below, and § 117 a, note 4), the sign of the definite accusative (§ 117 a), in its
connexion with suffixes, by a difference of pointing, the former making ?????, ??????, in
pause ??????, 2nd fem. ?????? (Is 54:10 ??????), ????, ?????,
, ???????, ????? (also in the later
books, especially in Kings, and always in Jer. and Ezek., incorrectly ????? with me;
????????? from thee, 1 K 20:25; ??????? from him, 1 K 22:7; ????? with them), while the

???????

latter retains its ô (obscured from â) before the light suffixes, but before grave
suffixes is pointed with Seghôl. This Seghôl is to be explained, with Praetorius,
ZDMG. Iv. 369 f., as the modification of an ? which again was shortened from
original â (in âth??, a??thô, &c.) in a closed syllable (?th-hem, &c.). The same
shortening and modification of the original â takes place before words in close
connexion, hence ???????, &c. When not in close connexion, the toneless ??? becomes
tone-long ???, e. g.

 Gn 1:1. Hence the following forms arise:—

???????, ??????? (so in Nu 22:12, Dt 29:16, both in principal pause, and often in very late passages,
otherwise ????? is generally used). In the first person, besides ?????, we also find ??????? (probably
from original ????; cf. Arab. (cid:31)inda, beside, with).

, ?????) is united with the suffixes ??, ???, and ??? by a

3. It is but seldom that prepositions occur with verbal suffixes, as
??????????

 Ps 139:11 (here probably for the

 Gn 2:21 and

??????

????

2. When pronominal suffixes are added to the prefixes (§ 102), there appears
occasionally, especially in the case of the shorter suffixes, an endeavour to lengthen
the preposition, so as to give it more strength and body. Hence to ?? is appended the
syllable ?? (see below, k), and ?? and ?? take at least a full vowel, ?? and ?? (§ 102 d, f).—
The following deviations from the analogy of the noun with suffixes are to be noticed

answered in the affirmative unless we conclude with Diehl and Haupt that all the
instances concerned are due to corruptions of the text. It is true that in such places as
Gn 9:26, 27, Dt 33:2, Is 30:5, Ps 73:10 (all in or immediately before the principal
pause; in Dt 33:2 with Zaqeph qa?on at least)

correct— ????(cid:31)???
, three times, Jb 20:23,
27:23 (beside ??????), and especially Jb 22:2. In all these places the most extreme
exegetical artifices can only be avoided by simply admitting a singular suffix (=??????,
??????, ??????).—On the question of the antiquity of the suffixes in ?? see § 91 l.

§ 104. Conjunctions.

1. The conjunctions serve to connect sentences, and to express their relations one

to another. They may be either—

(a) Original pronouns, e.g. the demonstrative ??? that, because, for.

(b) Original substantives, which afterwards were reduced to the rank of pronouns,

adverbs, or conjunctions; so perhaps ? ???? (see § 36), which is sometimes used to
express the general idea of relation, sometimes as a relative pronoun (properly a
demonstrative), but in many cases stands simply for ???; also ??? (nothing), that not; ????
that not (the Greek µ? of prohibition), &c. To these may be added the adverbial
 (in the not yet) earlier,
combination of substantives with prepositions, e.g.
before, for which
complex ideas (e.g. ?????? added to this, that=much more), see the Syntax, § 163 f.

????????
 is also used. On the combination of two particles to express

????????

(c) Prepositions, which with the addition of the conjunction ? ???? or ??? together

form one single conjunction, e.g.
??? ???
???
? ???? ????, and more frequently
and
? ???? ???  in consequence of the fact that, for the reason that, because. Sometimes,
however, the conjunction in such cases is omitted, and the preposition itself used as a
conjunction, e.g. ???? (for ? ????????) although, Jb 16:17.

???
? ???? ???  because, prop. on account of the fact that;
, after that; ? ??????? according as (with ??  );

? ???? ???

????

???

So, at any rate, according to our linguistic principles. It would, however, be more correct
to say, that instead of the intermediary ? ???? the whole of the succeeding sentence is regarded
as one substantival idea, under the immediate government of the preposition. In the same
way, all prepositions governing the gerund in English may be paraphrased by conjunctions
with the finite verb, see §§ 114 and 115, passim.

2. Besides those already mentioned, there are certain other small words now used

as conjunctions, of which the derivation or original meaning is altogether obscure,
thus ?? or, ???? if (also or before the second member of a double question), ?? also, ??
and, and others.

Rem. The pointing of the ?? (originally ??, as still before ?a?eph Patha? and—with a
following Dageš forte—in w?w consecutive of the imperfect; cf. § 49 f) is in many respects
analogous to that of the prefixes ??, ??  , ?? (§ 102 d–i), but as being a weak consonant, the w?w
copulative has some further peculiarities:

(a) Usually it takes simple Šewâ (??).

(b) Before words which begin with a guttural having a compound Šewâ, it takes the vowel
with which the Šewâ is compounded (according to § 28 b), e.g. ???????? and be thou wise, ???????????
and servants, ???????? and strength, ???????? and eat thou, ???????? and sickness. On ??????????, ?????????
&c., see § 102 d; on ?????????, &c., see § 102 m; on such cases as ??????? Jb 4:2, cf. § 28 b.

(c) Before words with simple Šewâ under the first consonant (except in the cases

under f), the W?w becomes the vowel û (cf. § 26 a), e.g. ?????? and to all, so also

. On the
(except in the case under g) before the cognate labials ?, ?  , ?, hence
cases in which simple Šewâ has become a ?a?eph after ? copulative (e.g. ??????? Gn
2:12), cf. § 10 g.

????????

(d) With a following ?? the ?? coalesces to form ??? according to § 24 b, as ?????? and let

him be. On the peculiar punctuation of the w?w copulative before forms with initial
Šewâ from ????? to be and ????? to live (e.g. ??????????? Jos 8:4, ???????? Gn 20:7), cf. § 63 q.

(e) Immediately before the tone-syllable it frequently takes Qame?, like ??, ??  , ?? (see
§ 102 f), but in most cases only at the end of a sentence or clause (but cf. also ????? 1 K
22:30), e.g.

; cf. also (with ?iph?a) Gn 33:13,
10:15
; 2 S 13:26  ????
2 S 15:12. The very frequent connexion of nouns expressing kindred ideas, by means
of ??, is due simply to considerations of rhythm, for even in such cases the W?w must
immediately precede the tone-syllable, which must be marked by a disjunctive accent,
e.g.
???? ??
 Gn 8:22 (see also the previous examples); Gn 13:14
(thrice); Ex 25:3
;
???? ??????? ????
???? 1K 21:10
?????
 thus and thus; Est 1:8 ???????????? at the end of the
 in spite of the De?i with the second ????, because it is
verse, but in Ps 87:5
???? ???
closely connected with the following predicate. Also with three words
???
Is 24:17. On the other hand, the rapid pronunciation ?? occurs before a conjunctive
accent (and, when farther removed from the principal pause, even with the smaller
disjunctives, in spite of a following tone-syllable), e.g.
31:40, Lv 7:23, Dt 2:21, and among the examples given above, Gn 7:13 and Ps 76:7.
(Exceptions:
??????????  Gn 13:14, where evidently the ?? is intended to ensure the slow and
 Jos 15:55,
solemn recitation of the promise, but also
immediately before the pause.) For the same rhythmical reason ?? (not ??) is used
regularly with certain monosyllables which, by their nature, lean more closely upon
 if not, with
the following word, thus ?????, ?????, ?????, ????? (to be distinguished from  ????
Zaqeph gadol, 2 K 5:17), and others.

§ 105. Interjections.

1. Among the interjections some (as in all languages) are simply natural sounds,

??????

or, as it were, vocal gestures, called forth involuntarily by certain impressions or
sensations, e.g. ????? (Ez 30:2 ???), ?? ah! ???? aha! (cf. this ?? also in ?????? and ???????
??????
utinam!),
??????
peace! Neh 8:11) hush! ??? (Am 5:16 ?????) ha! woe! ???,
4:10; ???????? 10:16) woe!

 2 K 20:3, Jn 1:14, Ps 116:4; also ??? (in pause ???, even in the plural

?????  hold your
 (Ps 120:5), ??? (in ????? Ec

) ah! (from ?? and ???), otherwise written

 Ex 32:31, &c. (Gn 50:17

??????

2. Others, however, originally expressed independent ideas, and become

)??? (
interjections only by rapid pronunciation and by usage, e.g.
(prop. here); ????? behold! (prop. imperative);
?????? , plur. ???? (prop. give, imperative of
?????; as to the tone, cf. § 69 o), come, the Latin age, agite! ????? (also ????), ???? (prop. go,

 or ????? behold!

???

imperative of ??????) with the same meaning1;
(see the Lexicon) I beseech, hear me! ??? pray!1 used to emphasize a demand, warning,
or entreaty, and always placed after the expression to which it belongs.2

 far be it! (prop. ad profanum!) ???

CHAPTER I

THE PARTS OF SPEECH

Syntax of the Verb.

USE OF THE TENSES AND MOODS.2

??(cid:31)???

 and ????? and the Ethiopic n?(cid:31)â, properly

 and ????? are also used in connexion with the feminine and the

1 1 ????? (Dt 1:8),
plural, which proves that they have become quite stereotyped as interjections.
1 1 ??? serves to express the most various shades of expression, which are discussed in
the various parts of the syntax. It is used especially (a) after the imperative, either in
commands or entreaty, see § 110 d; (b) with the imperfect, either in the cohortative (§
108 b) or jussive (§ 109 b); (c) once with perfect, Gn 40:14; (d) after various particles:
????????? behold now; particularly after the conjunctions ?? and ???: ?????? ne quaeso and
??????? if now, ?????, ?????? if, in a deprecatory sense, expressive of politeness or
modesty. In Nu 12:13 ??? stands after a noun; but we ought certainly to read ??????.—In
polite language this particle is used constantly in all these ways, Gn 18:3, 4, 19:7, 8,
19, and 50:17.
2 2 Against the usual view which regards ??? as a hortatory particle (=up! come!
analogous to the original imperatives
??(cid:31)???
hither, also come!), P. Haupt, in the Johns Hopkins University Circulars, xiii, no. 114,
p. 109, justly observes that we should then expect the particle to be prefixed to the
imperative, &c. He proposes to describe ??? as an emphatic particle. Haupt’s suggested
identification of this ??? with the Assyrian, Arabic, and Ethiopic particle m? (which is
also an enclitic of emphasis), and ultimately with the interrogative m?, we shall not
discuss here.

Sprache, Lpz. 1897 (see above, § 3 f). Important contributions to Hebrew syntax are
also contained in H. Reckendorf’s work Die syntakt. Verhältnisse des Arab., 2 pts.,
Leiden, 1895, 1898, of which we have already made use in § 97 a. Cf. also the same
author’s very instructive discussions Ueber syntakt. Forschung, Munich, 1899.
2 2 Cf. the sketch of the tenses and moods used in Hebrew in § 40; and on the general
characteristics of the perfect and imperfect see the note on § 47 a; also Driver, A
Treatise on the Use of the Tenses in Hebrew (Oxford, 1874; 3rd ed. 1892); Bennett,
‘Notes on the Use of the Hebrew Tenses’ (Hebraica, 1886, vols. ii, iii). A partial
modification of the accepted definition of the Semitic perfect and imperfect was
proposed by J. A. Knudtzon, Om det saakaldte Perfektum og Imperfektum i Hebraisk,

§ 106. Use of the Perfect.

The perfect serves to express actions, events, or states, which the speaker wishes

to represent from the point of view of completion, whether they belong to a
determinate past time, or extend into the present, or while still future, are pictured as
in their completed state.

The definition formerly given here (‘the perfect serves to express completed actions’)
applies, strictly speaking, only to some of the varieties of the perfect discussed under b–p:
hence the above modification based on the arguments of Knudtzon (for the title see note 2,
and cf. further § 107 a).

More particularly the uses of the perfect may be distinguished as follows:—

1. To represent actions, events, or states, which, after a shorter or longer duration,

were terminated in the past, and hence are finally concluded, viz.:

(a) Corresponding to the perfect proper in Latin and the English perfect definite,
in assertions, negations, confirmations, interrogations, &c., e.g. Gn 18:15 then Sarah
denied, saying, I laughed not (
) ……; and he said, Nay, but thou didst laugh
(????????); Gn 3:11 ???? ?????? ??? who told thee ….? Cf. 3:13, 14, 17, 22. Also pointing to
some undefined time in the past, e.g. Is 66:8 ?????? ??? ??????? who hath (ever yet) heard
such a thing?

??? ?????

?????

Rem. In opposition to this express use of the perfect to emphasize the completion of an
event, the imperfect is not infrequently used to emphasize that which is still future, e.g. Jos
1:5 as I was (????????) with Moses, so will I be (????????) with thee; Jos 1:17, Ex 10:14, Dt 32:21, 1
K 2:38, Is 46:4, 11, Jo 2:2, Ec 1:9.

(b) As a simple tempus historicum (corresponding to the Greek aorist) in narrating
past events, e.g. Gn 4:4 and Abel, he also brought (??????), &c.; Gn 7:19 the waters did
prevail (
relating repeated actions, 1 S 18:30.

????? ), &c.; Jb 1:1 there was a man (????? ????) in the land of Uz, &c.; even in

??

Rem. As the above examples indicate, the perfect of narration occurs especially at the
head of an entire narrative (Jb 1:1; cf. Dn 2:1) or an independent sentence (e.g. Gn 7:11, 13),
but in co-ordinate sentences, as a rule, only when the verb is separated from the copulative ?
by one or more words (cf. above Gn 4:4 and 7:19). In other cases, the narrative is continued in
the imperfect consecutive, according to § 111 a. The direct connexion of the narrative perfect
with ? copulative (not to be confounded with the perfect consecutive proper, § 112) agrees
rather with Aramaic syntax (cf. Kautzsch, Gramm. des Biblisch-Aram., § 71, 1 b). On the
examples (which are in many respects doubtful) in the earlier texts, see § 112 pp–uu.

Kristiania, 1890; of which a summary entitled ‘Vom sogenannten Perf. und Imperf.
im Hebr.’ appeared in the Transactions of the Oriental Congress at Stockholm,
section sémitique b, p. 73 ff. (Leiden, 1893). Cf. also Knudtzon’s articles, ‘Zur
assyrischen und allgemein semitischen Grammatik’ in the Zeitschrift für Assyriologie,
especially vi. 422 ff. and vii. 33 ff.

(c) To represent actions, &c., which were already completed in the past, at the
time when other actions or conditions took place (pluperfect),1 e.g. 1 S 28:3 now
Samuel was (long since) dead2 … and Saul had put away (??????) those that had
familiar spirits … out of the land. Both these statements, being as it were in
parentheses, merely assign a reason for the narrative beginning at verse 6. Cf. 1 S
9:15, 25:21, 2 S 18:18.—Gn 20:18 (for the Lord had fast closed up, &c.); 27:30,
31:19, 34, Dt 2:10; and in a negative statement, Gn 2:5 for the Lord God had not (up
to that time) caused it to rain, &c. This is especially frequent, from the nature of the
case, in relative, causal, and temporal clauses, when the main clause contains a tense
referring to the past, e.g. Gn 2:2 and he rested … from all his work which he had
made (? ????); Gn 7:9, 1927, &c.; 29:10 now when Jacob had seen Rachel (???? ? ???????)
…, Jacob went near, &c.; so also in clauses which express the completion or
incompleteness of one action, &c., on the occurrence of another, as in Gn 24:15,
27:30, &c.; cf. § 164 b, with the note, and c.

2. To represent actions, events, or states, which, although completed in the past,
nevertheless extend their influence into the present (in English generally rendered by
the present):

?

?????

?????

???? ???

?????  I know (prop. I have perceived, have experienced) Jb
 I know not Gn 4:9, &c.; on the other hand, e.g. in Gn 28:16, Nu

(a) Expressing facts which were accomplished long before, or conditions and
attributes which were acquired long before, but of which the effects still remain in the
present (present perfect), e.g. Ps 10:11 ?????? ???????? he hath hidden his face (and still
??? ??  I have spread forth my hands (and still keep them
keeps it hidden); Ps 143:6
spread forth). This applies particularly to a large number of perfects (almost
exclusively of intransitive1 verbs, denoting affections or states of the mind) which in
English can be rendered only by the present, or, in the case mentioned above under f,
by the imperfect.2 Thus,
9:2, 10:13,
?????
22:34, the context requires I knew not;
Jb 6:7; ????? it exulteth;
Gn 49:18, Ps 130:5 (parallel with
Is 1:11, &c.);
????
?
?????
further include a number of verbs which express bodily characteristics or states, such
as
?????
 thou art great Ps 104:1;
55:9; ??????? they stand aloof Jb 30:10;

 I wait
 I delight Ps 40:9 (mostly negative,
);
?????

Rem. To the same category probably belong also the perfects after ????????? Ex 10:3 how
long hast thou already been refusing (and refusest still …? which really amounts to how long
wilt thou refuse?), Ps 80:5, Pr 1:22 (co-ordinate with the imperf.), and after
 Ex 16:28,
Hb 1:2.

?????

????

(b) In direct narration to express actions which, although really only in process of
accomplishment, are nevertheless meant to be represented as already accomplished in
the conception of the speaker, e.g.
?????
14:22;
 I testify Dt 8:19;
????
(but in a different context in ver. 15, I have counselled);
????
consider as hereby settled) 2 S 19:30; I declare Jb 9:22, 32:10.

(c) To express facts which have formerly taken place, and are still of constant
recurrence, and hence are matters of common experience (the Greek gnomic aorist),
) them that seek thee. Cf. ver.
e.g. Ps 9:11 for thou, Lord, hast not forsaken (
13, also Ps 10:3, 119:40 and Gn 49:11 (?????).

?????

Rem. In almost all the cases discussed in No. 2 (included under the English present) the

imperfect can be used instead of the perfect, wherever the action or state in question is
regarded, not as already completed, but as still continuing or just taking place (see § 107 a).
Thus,

perfects in poetic or prophetic parallelism, e.g. Is 5:12, Ps 2:1 f., Pr 1:22, Jb 3:17.

3. To express future actions, when the speaker intends by an express assurance to

represent them as finished, or as equivalent to accomplished facts:

(a) In contracts or other express stipulations (again corresponding to the English
present, and therefore closely related to the instances noted under i), e.g. Gn 23:11 the

(b) To express facts which are undoubtedly imminent, and, therefore, in the
imagination of the speaker, already accomplished (perfectum confidentiae), e.g. Nu
17:27
?
Gn 30:13, Is 6:5 (
18:12, Nu 17:28, 23:10, Ju 9:9, 11, Zc 4:10 (?), Pr 22:20.2 This use of the perfect

of the perfect in conditional sentences, cf. below, p.
2 2In Gn 40:14 a perf. confidentiae (after ??? ???; but cf. § 163 d) appears to be used in
the expression of an earnest desire that something may happen (but have me in thy
remembrance, &c.). Neither this passage, however, nor the use of the perfect in
Arabic to express a wish or imprecation, justifies us in assuming the existence of a

occurs most frequently in prophetic language (perfectum propheticum). The prophet
so transports ports himself in imagination into the future that he describes the future
event as if it had been already seen or heard by him, e.g. Is 5:13 therefore my people
are gone into captivity (?????); 9:1 ff., 10:28, 11:9 (after ???, as frequently elsewhere);
19:7, Jb 5:20, 2 Ch 20:37. Not infrequently the imperfect interchanges with such
perfects either in the parallel member or further on in the narrative.

(c) To express actions or facts, which are meant to be indicated as existing in the
future in a completed state (futurum exactum), e.g. Is 4:4 ????? ??? when he has washed
away=when he shall have washed away (an imperfect follows in the co-ordinate
sentence; cf. the conditional sentences in § 107 x); Is 6:11 (after ??? ? ???? ???, as in Gn
28:15, Nu 32:17; also 2 S 17:13 after ? ???? ???, Gn 24:19 after ??? ??? and elsewhere
frequently after temporal conjunctions); Mi 5:2 (

despairing resignation. Cf. Pr 23:15, Est 4:16.

§ 107. Use of the Imperfect.1

The imperfect, as opposed to the perfect, represents actions, events, or states
which are regarded by the speaker at any moment as still continuing, or in process of
accomplishment, or even as just taking place. In the last case, its occurrence may be
represented as certainly imminent, or merely as conceived in the mind of the speaker,
or simply as desired, and therefore only contingent (the modal use of the imperfect).

Knudtzon (see above, Rem. on §106 a), comparing the Ass.-Bab. usage, would prefer the

term present rather than imperfect, on the ground that the tense expresses what is either
actually or mentally present. In any case, the essential difference between the perfect and
imperfect consists, he argues, in this, that the perfect simply indicates what is actually
complete, while the imperfect places the action, &c., in a more direct relation to the
judgement or feeling of the speaker.

precative perfect in Hebrew. In Jb 21:16, 22:18, also, translate the counsel of the
wicked is far from me. Cf. Driver, Tenses3, p. 25 f. In Is 43:9 either ???????? is imperative
(see § 51 o) or we must read ?????????, corresponding to ???????? which follows.
1 1 Cf. the literature cited above, p. 309, note 2.

More precisely the imperfect serves—

1. In the sphere of past time:

(a) To express actions, &c., which continued throughout a longer or shorter
period,1 e.g. Gn 2:6 a mist went up continually (????????), 2:25, 37:7, 48:10, Ex 1:12,
8:20, 13:22, 15:6, 12, 14, 15, Nu 9:15 f. 20 f., 23 7, Ju 2:1, 5:8, 1 S 3:2, 13:17 f., 2 S
2:28, 23:10, 1 K 3:4, 21:6, Is 1:21, 6:4 (???????), 17:10 f., 51:2 x, Jer 13:7, 36:18, Ps
18:7, 14, 17 ff.38 ff., 24:2, 32:4, 5 (??????????), 47:5, 68:10, 12, 104:6 ff., 106:19, 107:18,
29, 139:13, Jb 3:11, 4:12, 15 f., 10:10 f., 15:7 f.—very frequently alternating with a
perfect (especially with a frequentative perfect; cf. Nu 9:15–23 and § 112 e), or when
the narration is continued by means of an imperfect consecutive.2

??????  e.g. Gn 19:4

????????

yet,
4:41, Jos 10:12, 1 K 3:16, 8:1, Ps 126:2, Jb 38:21. (The perfect is used after ?? when stress is
to be laid on the fact that the action has really taken place, and not upon its gradual
accomplishment or duration in the past, e.g. Gn 4:26 ????? ?? then began, &c.; Gn 49:4, Ex
15:15, Jos 22:31, Ju 5:11, Ps 89:20.)3 After
Gn 2:5, 24:45, 1 S 3:3, 7, always in the sense of our pluperfect. (In Gn 24:15 instead of the
perf. ?????, the imperf. should be read, as in verse 45; so also in 1 S 3:7 [???????] an imperf. is co-
??????  Ex 12:34, Jos 3:1), e.g. Jer 1:5
ordinated with ???). After

imperf. may be used, according to the context, in the sense of our future, e.g. 2 K 2:9, Is
65:24, Jb 10:21; after ???? e.g. Is 22:14. The imperf. is used in the sense of our present after
??????  in Ex 9:30, 10:7.

 before thou camest forth; Gn 27:33, 37:18, 41:50, Ru 3:14 (perhaps also in Ps 90:2

2. Driver (Tenses3, p. 35 f.) rightly lays stress upon the inherent distinction between the
participle as expressing mere duration, and the imperfect as expressing progressive duration
(in the present, past, or future). Thus the words
Paradise as going out of Eden in a continuous, uninterrupted stream, but ???????, which
immediately follows, describes how the parting of its waters is always taking place afresh. In
the same way ????????? Gn 2:6 represents new mists as constantly arising, and ??????? Is 6:4 new
clouds of smoke. Also those actions, &c., which might be regarded in themselves as single or

 Gn 2:10 represent the river of

? ???????

????

1 1 Cf. the Mêša(cid:31) inscription, l. 5, ????? ??? ???? ?? for Chemosh was angry with his
land. As Driver, Tenses, 3rd ed., § 27, 1 a, remarks, this vivid realization of the
accomplishment of the action is especially frequent in poetic and prophetic style.
2 2 According to the Masora such imperfects occur in Is 1013 bis (where, however,
??????? might also mean I am wont to remove, &c.), Is 48:3, 57:17, Ps 18:38a, also
(according to § 49 c) in 2 S 1:10 and Ez 16:10. In some other cases ?? is no doubt a
dogmatic emendation for ?? (imperf. consec.) in order to represent historical statements
as promises; cf. Is 42:6, 43:28 [contrasted with 42:25], 512 bis, 63:3 ff. and the note on
§ 53 p.
3 3 After ?? then (to announce future events) the imperf. is naturally used in the sense
of a future, Gn 24:41, Ex 12:48, Mi 3:4, Zp 3:9, Ps 51:21.

even momentary, are, as it were, broken up by the imperfect into their component parts, and
so pictured as gradually completing themselves. Hence
 Ex 15:12 (after a perf. as in
verse 14) represents the Egyptians, in a vivid, poetic description, as being swallowed up one
after another, and

 Nu 23:7 the leading on by stages, &c.

????????

??????

???

????

(b) To express actions, &c., which were repeated in the past, either at fixed
intervals or occasionally (the modus rei repetitae), e.g. Jb 1:5 thus did (? ???????) Job
continually (after each occasion of his sons’ festivities); 4:3 f., 22:6 f., 23:11, 29:7, 9,
12 f., Gn 6:4, 29:2, 30:38, 42:31, 39 (I used to bear the loss of it), Ex 1:12, 19:19,
33:7 ff. (????? used to take every time), 40:36 ff., Nu 9:17 f. 20 ff., 11:5, 9, Ju 6:4,
14:10, 21:25, 1 S 1:7, 2:22, 9:9, 13:19, 18:5, 27:9, 2 S 1:22, 12:3, 13:18, 1 K 5:25 (of
tribute repeated year by year), 10:5, 13:33, 14:28, 2 K 4:8, 8:29, 13:20, 25:14, Jer
36:23, Ps 42:5, 44:3, 78:15, 40, 103:7, Est 2:14; even in a negative dependent clause,
1 K 18:10.

2. In the sphere of present time, again

(a) To express actions, events, or states, which are continued for a shorter or
longer time,1 e.g. Gn 37:15 ??????????? what seekest thou? 19:19 ????????? I cannot;
24:50, 31:35, Is 1:13. Other examples are Gn 2:10, 24:31, 1 S 1:8, 11:5, 1 K 3:7, Ps
2:2, and in the prophetic formula ??????? ?????? saith the Lord, Is 1:11, 18, &c., cf. 40:1.
So especially to express facts known by experience, which occur at all times, and
consequently hold good at any moment, e.g. Pr 15:20 a wise son maketh a glad father;
hence especially frequent in Job and Proverbs. In an interrogative sentence, e.g. Jb
4:17 is mortal man just before God? In a negative sentence, Jb 4:18, &c.

(b) To express actions, &c., which may be repeated at any time, including
therefore the present, or are customarily repeated on a given occasion (cf. above, e),
e.g. Dt 1:44 as bees do (are accustomed to do); Gn 6:21, 32:33, 43:32, Ju 11:40, 1 S
2:8, 5:5, 20:2, 2 S 15:32, Is 1:23, 3:16, Ps 1:3. So again (see f) especially to express
facts known by experience which may at any time come into effect again, e.g. Ex 23:8
a gift blindeth (???????), &c.; Gn 2:24, 22:14, Is 32:6, Am 3:7, Mal 1:6, Jb 2:4, &c. Of the
same kind also is the imperfect in such relative clauses (see § 155), as Gn 49:27
Benjamin is ??????? ????? a wolf that ravineth (properly, is accustomed to ravin). Finally,
compare also the formulae
expressions) Gn 10:9, 22:14, &c.; ??? ? ??????????? it is not (wont to be) so done (and
hence may not, shall not be, see u), Gn 29:26, 20:9, 34:7, 2 S 13:12.

?????  it is (wont to be) said (to introduce proverbial

??

(c) To express actions, &c., which although, strictly speaking, they are already
finished, are regarded as still lasting on into the present time, or continuing to operate
in it, e.g. Gn 32:30 wherefore is it that thou dost ask (?? ????) after my name? 24:31,
44:7, Ex 5:15, 2 S 16:9. In such cases, naturally, the perfect is also admissible, and is
sometimes found in the same formula as the imperfect, e.g. Jb 1:7 (22)
whence comest thou (just now)? but Gn 16:8 (cf. 42:7) ????? ?????????? whence camest
thou? The imperfect represents the coming as still in its last stage, whereas the perfect
represents it as an accomplished fact.

????? ???

????

1 1 It is not always possible to carry out with certainty the distinction between
continued and repeated actions. Some of the examples given under f might equally be
referred to g.

3. In the sphere of future time. To express actions, &c., which are to be

represented as about to take place, and as continuing a shorter or longer time in the
future, or as being repeated; thus:

(a) From the standpoint of the speaker’s present time, e.g. Ex 4:1 they will not

???

believe (
6:1, 9:5, &c.

?

???????

) me, nor hearken (???? ????) unto my voice: for they will say (????????), &c.,

(b) In dependent clauses to represent actions, &c., which from some point of time

in the past are to be represented as future, e.g. Gn 43:7 could we in any wise know

erat; 13:14, Jon 4:5, Jb 3:3, Ec 2:3, Ps 78:6 that the generation to come might know,
????
 the children which should be born (qui nascituri essent; the imperfect here
???? ??????
?
with the collateral idea of the occurrence being repeated in the future).

(c) To represent a futurum exactum; cf. Is 4:4, 6:11 (co-ordinated with a perfect
used in the same sense, see § 106 o); so also sometimes after the temporal particles ???,
Ps 132:5, and ? ???? ??? until, Gn 29:8, Nu 20:17, &c.

4. Finally to the sphere of future time belong also those cases in which the (modal)

imperfect serves to express actions, events, or states, the occurrence of which is to be
represented as willed (or not willed), or as in some way conditional, and consequently
only contingent. More particularly such imperfects serve—

(a) As an expression of will, whether it be a definite intention and arrangement, or

a simple desire, viz.:

(1) Sometimes in positive sentences in place of the cohortative (cf. e.g. Ps 59:17
with verse 18; 2 S 22:50 with Ps 18:50; Ju 19:11, &c.), of the imperative (Is 18:3), or
of the jussive (which, however, in most cases, does not differ from the ordinary form
of the imperfect), e.g. ???????? let it appear Gn 1:9, 41:34, Lv 19:2, 3, 2 S 10:12 (and so
frequently in verbs ???; cf. § 109 a, note 2); Zc 9:5 (??????); Ps 61:7 (??????); Pr 22:17
(?? ????); 23:1, Jb 6:23 (co-ordinated with the imperative), 10:20 Keth.; so probably also
????  let him judge! Ps 72:2.—So also in the 1st pers., to express a wish which is
asserted subsequently with reference to a fixed point of time in the past, e.g. Jb 10:18
??????? I ought to [not should as A.V., R.V.] have, (then, immediately after being born)
given up the ghost; cf. verse 19 ???????? and ?????? Lv 10:18, Nu 35:28. Even to express
an obligation or necessity according to the judgement of another person, e.g. Jb 9:29
? ?????? I am to be guilty, 12:4. Cp. Jb 9:15, 19:16; in a question, Ps 42:10, 43:2.

??

(2) To express the definite expectation that something will not happen. The
imperfect with ??? represents a more emphatic form of prohibition than the jussive1
with ??? (cf. § 109 c), and corresponds to our thou shalt not do it! with the strongest
expectation of obedience, while ??? with the jussive is rather a simple warning, do not
that! Thus ??? with the imperfect is especially used in enforcing the divine
commands, e.g.  ????? ???
??? with the 3rd pers. perhaps in Pr 16:10.

 thou shalt not steal Ex 20:15; cf. verses 3, 4, 5, 7, 10 ff. So

??

1 1 As stated in § 46 a, a prohibition cannot be expressed by ??? and the imperative.

Rem. The jussive, which is to be expected after ???, does not, as a rule (according to n,
and § 109 a, note 2), differ in form from the simple imperfect. That many supposed jussives
are intended as simple imperfects is possible from the occurrence after ??? of what are
undoubtedly imperfect forms, not only from verbs ??? (cf. § 109 a, note 2), but also from
verbs ???, to express a prohibition or negative wish, ????????? Gn 19:17, ???????? Jos 1:7,  ??????
?? ???? 1 S 25:25. Even with the 1st pers. plur. (after an imperative) ?????????? that we die not, 1 S
12:19. Also to express the conviction that something cannot happen, ???????? he will not
slumber, 2 Ps 121:3; cf. Jer 46:6, 2 Ch 14:10.

imperfect (or jussive? see the examples in § 109 f) is added to the expression of the
command by an asyndeton, and in La 1:19 to the principal clause simply by ??: while
they sought them food

(b) To express actions, &c., which are to be represented as possibly taking place

or not taking place (sometimes corresponding to the potential of the classical
languages, as also to our periphrases with can, may, should4). More particularly such
imperfects are used—

(1) In a permissive sense, e.g. Gn 2:16 of every tree of the garden (?????? ????)
thou mayest freely eat (the opposite in verse 17); 3:2, 42:37, Lv 21:3, 22, Jb 21:3. In
the 1st pers. Ps 5:8, 22:18 (I may, or can, tell); in a negative sentence, e.g. Ps 5:5.

(2) In interrogative sentences, e.g. Pr 20:9 ??????????? quis dixerit? Cf. Gn 17:17,
18:14, 31:43, 1 S 11:12, 2 K 5:12 ????? ?????????????? may I not wash in them? Is 33:14, Ps
15:1, 24:3, Ec 5:5. So especially in a question expressing surprise after ?????, e.g. Gn
39:9 how then can I …? 44:34, Is 19:11, Ps 137:4, and even with regard to some point
of time in the past, looking forward from which an event might have been expected to
take place, e.g. Gn 43:7 ????? ???????? could we in any wise know …? Cf. 2 S 3:33 (?????

 in a causal sense (because, since), e.g. Ju 2:20 (as ? ???? Gn 34:27) is

2 2 To regard this as an optative (so Hupfeld) is from the context impossible. It is
more probably a strong pregnant construction, or fusion of two sentences (such as, do
not think he will slumber!). Verse 4 contains the objective confirmation, by means of
??? with the imperf., of that which was previously only a subjective conviction.

4 4 By this, of course, is not meant that these finer distinctions were consciously
present to the Hebrew mind. They are rather mere expedients for making intelligible
to ourselves the full significance of the Semitic imperfect.

was Abner to die as a fool, i.e. was he destined to die …?), and so probably also Gn
34:31 (should he deal …?). Very closely connected with this is the use of the
imperfect—

(3) In a consecutive clause depending on an interrogative clause, e.g. Ex 3:11,
who am I (?????? ???) that I should (ought, could) go? 16:7, Nu 11:12, Ju 9:28, 1 S 18:18,
2 K 8:13, Is 29:16, Jb 6:11, 21:15, similarly after ? ???? Gn 38:18, Ex 5:2.

Rem. In passages like 1 S 11:5, Ps 8:5, 114:5, the context shows that the imperfect
corresponds rather to our present. In such sentences the perfect also is naturally used in
referring to completed actions, e.g. Gn 20:10, Ju 18:23, 2 S 7:18, Is 22:1.

(4) In negative sentences to express actions, &c., which cannot or should not
happen, e.g. Gn 32:13 ????? ???????????? ? ???? which cannot be numbered for multitude;
20:9 deeds (?????????? ? ????) that ought not to be done (cf. above, g); Ps 5:5.

 ...

 ??????????? ???

??? ???????????

(5) In conditional clauses (the modus conditionalis corresponding to the Latin
present or imperfect conjunctive) both in the protasis and apodosis, or only in the
latter, Ps. 23:4
(or I would fear) no evil; Jb 9:20 though I be righteous, mine own mouth shall
condemn me. After a perfect in the protasis, e.g. Jb 23:10. Very frequently also in an
apodosis, the protasis to which must be supplied from the context, e.g. Jb 5:8 but as
for me, I would seek unto God (were I in thy place); 3:13, 16, 14:14 f., Ps 55:13, Ru
1:12. However, some of the imperfects in these examples are probably intended as
jussive forms. Cf. §109 h.

 yea, though I walk (or had to walk) … I fear

§ 108. Use of the Cohortative.

The cohortative, i.e. according to § 48 c, the 1st pers.1 sing. or plur. of the

imperfect lengthened by the ending ? ??, 2 represents in general an endeavour directed
expressly towards a definite object. While the corresponding forms of the indicative
rather express the mere announcement that an action will be undertaken, the
cohortative lays stress on the determination underlying the action, and the personal
interest in it.

Its uses may be divided into—

1. The cohortative standing alone, or co-ordinated with another cohortative, and

frequently strengthened by the addition of the particle ???:

(a) To express self-encouragement, e.g. Ex 3:3

 I will turn aside now,
and see …! So especially as the result of inward deliberation (in soliloquies), e.g. Gn
18:21, 32:21 (rarely so used after ???, Gn 21:16 let me not look …! Jer 18:18), and
also as a more or less emphatic statement of a fixed determination, e.g. Is 5:1 I will
sing3 …! 5:6, 31:8. Cf. also Gn 46:30 now let me die (I am willing to die), since I have

??? ???????

????

1 1 For the few examples of cohortatives in the 3rd sing., see § 48 d.
2 2 But verbs ???, according to § 75 l, even in the cohortative, almost always have the
ending ? ??; cf. e.g. in Dt 32:20 ??????? after
3 [3 R.V. let me sing.]

.
?????(cid:31)????

seen thy face; and Ps 31:8. In the 1st pers. plur. the cohortative includes a summons to
others to help in doing something, e.g. Ps 2:3 ????????? come! let us break asunder! &c.,
and Gn 11:3.

(b) To express a wish, or a request for permission, that one should be allowed to

do something, e.g. Dt 2:27 ????????? may I be allowed to pass through (let me pass
through)! Nu 20:17 ????????????? may we be allowed to pass through! Jer 40:15 let me go,
I pray thee! &c.; 2 S 16:9; so after ??? 2 S 18:14; after ??? 2 S 24:14, Jer 17:18, Ps

2. The cohortative in dependence on other moods, as well as in conditional

sentences: (a) In dependence (with w?w copulative; Ps 9:15 after
imperative or jussive to express an intention or intended consequence, e.g. Gn 27:4
 that I may eat, prop. then will I eat; Gn 19:5, 23:4, 24:56, 27:25,
bring it to me,
29:21, 30:25 f., 42:34, 49:1, Dt 32:1, Ho 6:1, Ps 2:8, 39:14, Jb 10:20 Qerê; Is 5:19 and
let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw nigh and come, ?????????? that we may
know (it)! Gn 26:28, 1 S 27:5. Also after negative sentences, Gn 18:30, 32, Ju 6:39,
and after interrogative sentences, 1 K 22:7, Is 40:25, 41:26, Am 8:5.

) on an

??????

(b) In conditional sentences (with or without  ??? ) to express a contingent intention,

e.g. Jb 16:6 ????????????? should I determine to speak, my grief is not assuaged, ??????????
and should I forbear, what am I eased? without ??? Jb 19:18, 30:26 (where, however,
??????? is probably intended); Ps 73:16 (unless ??????? should be read), 139:8 f. After the
3rd person, Jb 11:17 though it be dark, &c. So perhaps also 2 S 22:38 ????????? if I
determined to pursue, then …, but cf. Ps 18:38.

(c) Likewise in the apodosis of conditional sentences, e.g. Jb 31:7 f. if my step
hath turned out of the way …, ????????? then let me sow; cf. 16:4 f. I also could speak as
ye do, if …! So even when the condition must be supplied from the context, e.g. Ps
40:6 else would I declare and speak of them; 51:18 else would I (gladly) give it, i.e. if
thou didst require it (cf. the precisely similar ???????? Ps 55:13); Jb 6:10. In the 1st plur.
Jer 20:10. To the same category belong the cohortatives after the formula expressing a
wish ??????????,
, e.g. Jer 9:1 oh, that I had …, ???????????? then (i.e. if I had) should I
(or would I) leave my people, &c.; Ju 9:29; without W?w Is 27:4, Ps 55:7, Jb 23:4 (cf.
also verse 7).

???????????

????

Rem. 1. The question, whether a resolution formed under compulsion (a necessity) is also

expressed by the cohortative (so, according to the prevailing opinion, in Is 38:10
; Jer
3:25, 4:19, 21, 6:10, Ps 55:3, 18 (?); 57:5, where, however, with Hupfeld, ?????? ?? should be
read; 77:7, 88:16, and in the 1st plur. Is 59:10), is to be answered in the sense that in these
examples the cohortative form is used after its meaning has become entirely lost, merely for
the sake of its fuller sound, instead of the ordinary imperfect. This view is strongly

????????

supported by the rather numerous examples of cohortative forms after w?w consec. of the

imperfect (cf. § 49 e, as also Ps 66:6 ????? ???? ? ?? there did we rejoice1; Ps 119:163

????

?????????

; Pr

1 1 Analogous to this cohortative (as equivalent to the imperfect) after  ???  is the use of
the historic imperf. after ??, § 107 c.

7:7), which can likewise only be explained as forms chosen merely for euphony, and
therefore due to considerations of rhythm.

2. The cohortative is strange after ???? Ps 73:17 until I went …

????????

 I considered their

latter end; possibly a pregnant construction for ‘until I made up my mind, saying, I will
consider’, &c. (but
any rate to be explained in the same way (in Jer 49:19, 50:44 we have ?????? with a similar
meaning), as long as I (intentionally) wink with the eyelashes (shall wink). On the other hand,
in Ex 32:30 ??????? is to be read, with the Samaritan, instead of ????????? after ?????.

 Pr 7:7 is still dependent on the preceding ??);

§ 109. Use of the Jussive.

As the cohortative is used in the 1st pers., so the jussive is especially found in the

2nd and 3rd pers. sing. and plur. to express a more or less definite desire that
something should or should not happen (cf. for its form, which frequently coincides
with that of the ordinary imperfect, 2 § 48 f, g). More particularly its uses may be
distinguished as follows:

1. The jussive standing alone, or co-ordinated with another jussive:

(a) In affirmative sentences to express a command, a wish (or a blessing), advice,
or a request; in the last case (the optative or precative) it is frequently strengthened by
the addition of ???. Examples: Gn 1:3 ??? ????? let there be light! Gn 1:6, 9, 11, &c. (the
creative commands); Nu 6:26 the Lord lift up his countenance upon thee, and give
thee peace! cf. verse 25. After particles expressing a wish, Gn 30:34 ????? ?? I would it
might be; Ps 81:9 ??????? ???????? if thou wouldest hearken unto me! As a humble request,
Gn 44:33 …
the lad go up, &c., Gn 47:4.

 let thy servant, I pray thee, abide, &c., and let

 ???????? ????? ?????

?? ???????

??????
?

 ...

(b) In negative sentences to express prohibition or dissuasion, warning, a negative

wish (or imprecation), and a request. The prohibitive particle used before the jussive
(according to § 107 o) is almost always ??? (in negative desires and requests
frequently ??????); e. g. Ex 34:3 ???????? ???? neither let any man be seen! Pr 3:7 be not
(
) wise in thine own eyes! Jb 15:31 ???????? ??? ne confidat. In the form of a
??????
request (prayer), Dt 9:26 ??? ??????? destroy not! 1 K 2:20, Ps 27:9, 69:18.

??

Rem. 1. The few examples of ??? with the jussive could at most have arisen from the
attempt to moderate subsequently by means of the jussive (voluntative) form what was at first
intended to be a strict command (??? with imperf. indic.); probably, however, they are either
cases in which the defective writing has been misunderstood (as in 1 K 2:6, Ez 48:14), or (as
in Gn 24:8) instances of the purely rhythmical jussive form treated below, under k. Moreover,
cf. ????? ??? Jo 2:2 and from the same verb Gn 4:12 (unless it is to be referred to h) and Dt
13:1. The same form, however, appears also to stand three times for the cohortative (see
below), and in Nu 22:19 for the ordinary imperfect (but see below, i). Thus it is doubtful

2 2 With regard to verbs ???, it is true that the full form of the imperfect is frequently
used with the meaning of the jussive (as also for the cohortative, see § 108 a, note 2),
e. g. ?????????? Jb 3:9 (but previously ????? let it look for!):especially in (Neh 2:3) and
immediately before the principal pause, Gn 1:9 ????????; Ju 6:39 ????????, but previously
?????????; Is 47:3 ????????, previously ?????; Ps 109:7. On the attempt to distinguish such
jussives from the imperfect by means of a special meaning ? ??, see § 75 hh.

whether an imaginary by-form of the ordinary imperf. is not intended by the Masora in all
these cases, and whether consequently ?????, &c., should not be restored.—On ???????? ??????????,
&c., Dt 7:16, 13:9, &c., Ez 5:11, &c., cf. § 72 r, according to which ????? should probably be
read in every case.—The jussive appears in the place of the cohortative after ??? 1 S 14:36

Ez 5:16.

 co-ordinated with two cohortatives), 2 S 17:12; cf. Is 41:23 Keth. (????, i. e.

?????

2. ??? with the jussive (or imperf., cf. § 107 p) is used sometimes to express the

conviction that something cannot or should not happen; cf. Is 2:9 (where, however, the text is
very doubtful) ????? ??????????? and thou canst not possibly forgive them [R. V. therefore forgive
them not]; Ps 34:6, 41:3, 50:3, 121:3 (????????); Pr 3:25, Jb 5:22 ????????? neither needest thou be
afraid; 20:17, 40:32.

2. The jussive depending on other moods, or in conditional sentences:

(a) Depending1 (with W?w) on an imperative or cohortative to express an

intention or an assurance of a contingent occurrence, e. g. Gn 24:51 take her and go,
and let her be (?????? prop. and she will be)…; 30:3, 31:37, 38:24, Ex 8:4, 9:13, 10:17,
14:2, Jos 4:16, Ju 6:30, 1 S 5:11, 7:3, 1 K 21:10, Ps 144:5, Pr 20:22, Jb 146. Also after
interrogative sentences, which include a demand, Est 7:2 (say) what is thy desire…,
??????? and it shall (i. e. in order that it may) be granted! 1 K 22:20, Is 19:12, Jb 38:34f.
Depending on a cohortative, e. g. Gn 19:20
thither…? ?????? ?????? that my soul may live; even after a simple imperf. (cf. below, g), 1
K 13:33 whosoever would, he consecrated him … ?????? that he might be a priest (read
?????) of the high places, but probably the LXX reading ??????? is to be preferred.

 oh, let me escape

?? ??? ??????????

????

Rem. In 2 Ch 35:21 a negative final clause with ????? is dependent on an imperative,
forbear from (meddling with) God … that he destroy thee not. As a rule, however, negative
final clauses are attached to the principal sentence by means of ????? and a following
imperfect; so after an imperative, Gn 42:2, 1 K 14:2, 18:44; after a jussive, Ex 30:20, Neh
6:9; after a perfect consec., Ex 28:35, 43, 30:12, Nu 18:5; after ??? with an imperfect, Lv
10:6, Nu 18:3, Dt 17:17 neither shall he multiply wives unto himself (?????? ????? ?????) that his
heart turn not away; 1 S 20:14, 2 S 21:17, Jer 11:21; after ??? with jussive, Lv 10:9, 11:43,
16:2, 2 S 13:25, Jer 25:6, 37:20, 38:24 f.; after the asseverative ??? with the impft., Gn 14:23;
even after a simple imperfect, Jer 10:4 with nails … they fasten it (?????? ?????) that it move not;
after a participle, Jb 9:7.

(b) Frequently in conditional sentences (as in Arabic), either in the protasis or in
the apodosis, cf. Ps 45:12 ?????? should he desire … then …; 104:20
 if thou
makest darkness, then it is night; so also in the protasis, Ex 22:4, Lv 15:24, Is 41:28,
???????? ), Jb 34:29; in the apodosis, Ex 7:9 then will it (not, then shall it) become
Ez 14:7 (
a serpent; Pr 9:9 after an imperat. in the protasis; Jb 10:16, 13:5, 22:28. In a negative
apodosis, Gn 4:12 (??????????, but see above, d). In 2 K 6:27 ???? ???????? (if the Lord do
not help thee, &c.) is to be explained as a jussive in a negative protasis.

 ...

???

Rem. Undoubtedly this use of the jussive (in conditional sentences) is based on its
original voluntative meaning; let something be so and so, then this or that must happen as a

1 1 This does not include the cases in which the jussive is not logically dependent on a
preceding imperat., but is merely co-ordinated, e. g. Gn 20:7, Ps 27:14, &c.

consequence. Certain other examples of the jussive, however, show that in the consciousness
of the language the voluntative has in such cases become weakened almost to a potential
mood, and hence the jussive serves to express facts which may happen contingently, or may
be expected, e. g. Nu 22:19 (
that might lay (? ????, hence plainly a subjunctive=qui ponat; also in Nu 23:19 ????????? that he
should lie is probably intended as a jussive); Ec 5:14; so after interrogative sentences, Jer 9:11
who is the wise man, ??????? qui intelligat hoc?; Ho 14:10.

, but cf. above, d); Jb 9:33 there is no daysman betwixt us,

Moreover, in not a few cases, the jussive is used, without any collateral sense, for the

ordinary imperfect form, and this occurs not alone in forms, which may arise from a
misunderstanding of the defective writing, as Dt 28:21, 36, 32:8, 1 K 8:1, Is 12:1, Mi 3:4, 5:8,
Ps 11:6, 18:12, 21:2 Qerê (
13:27, 15:33, 18:9, 20:23, 37:22, 33:11, 36:14, 38:24, Ec 12:6 (verse 7 ?????, but immediately
afterwards ?????), Dn 8:12, —but also in shortened forms, such as ????? Gn 49:17 (Sam; ???????), Dt
28:8, 1 S 10:5, 2 S 5:24, Ho 6:1, 11:4, Am 5:14, Mi 1:2, Zp 2:13, Zc 9:5, Ps 72:16 f. (after
other jussives), 104:31, Jb 18:12, 20:23, 26, 28, 27:8, 33:21, 34:37, Ru 3:4. This use of the
jussive can hardly be due merely to poetic licence, but is rather to be explained on rhythmical
grounds. In all the above-##ited examples, in fact, the jussive stands at the beginning of the
sentence (and hence removed as far as possible from the principal tone), in others it is
immediately before the principal pause (Is 42:6, 50:2, Ps 68:15, Pr 23:25, Jb 24:14, 29:3,
40:19), or actually in pause (Dt. 32:18, Jb 23:9, 11, La 3:50), and is then a simply rhythmical
shortening due to the strong influence of the tone. Moreover, since the jussive in numerous
cases is not distinguished in form from the imperfect (§ 48 g), it is frequently doubtful which
of the two the writer intended. This especially applies to those cases, in which a subjunctive is
to be expressed by one or other of the forms (cf. § 107 k and m–x).

Mayer Lambert, ‘Sur la syntaxe de l’impératif en hébreu,’ in REJ. 1897, p. 106 ff.

1. The imperative,1 which, according to § 46, is restricted to the 2nd pers. sing.
and plur., and to positive commands, &c., may stand either alone, or in simple co-
ordination (as in 1 K 18:44, Is 56:1, 65:18) with other imperatives:

(a) To express real commands, e. g. Gn 12:1 get thee out of thy country; or (like

the jussive) mere admonitions (Ho 10:12) and requests, 2 K 5:22, Is 5:3; on the
addition of ??? see below, Rem. 1. The imperative is used in the sense of an ironical
challenge (often including a threat) in 1 K 2:22 ask for him the kingdom also; 22:15,
Ju 10:14, Is 47:12 (with ???), Jer 7:21, Ez 20:39, Am 4:4, Jb 38:3f., 40:10ff., La 4:21.
The imperative has a concessive sense in Na 3:15 (though thou make thyself many,
&c.), and in the cases discussed under f, e. g. Is 8:9 f., 29:9.

(b) To express permission, e. g. 2 S 18:23 after previous dissuasion, (then) run (as

far as I am concerned)! Is 21:12, 45:11.

(c) To express a distinct assurance (like our expression, thou shalt have it)2 or
promise, e. g. Is 65:18 but be ye glad, &c. (i. e. ye will have continually occasion to

1 1 On the close relation between the imperative and jussive (both in meaning and
form), cf. § 46 and § 48 i.
2 2 Like the threatening formulae in the Latin comic writers, e. g. vapula, Ter. Phorm.
v. 6, 10=vapulare te iubeo, Plaut. Curc. vi. 4, 12.

be glad); and Is 37:30, Ps 110:2; in a threat, Jer 2:19. So especially in commands, the
fulfilment of which is altogether out of the power of the person addressed, e. g. Is
54:14 be far from anxiety (meaning, thou needst not fear any more); Gn 1:28, &c. (for
other examples, such as 1 K 22:12, 2 K 5:13, see below, f). Most clearly in the case of
the imperative Niph(cid:31)al with a passive meaning, e. g. Gn 42:16 ???????? ?????? and ye
shall be bound; Dt 32:50, Is 49:9 (Is 45:22, see below, f).

Rem. 1. The particle ??? age! (§ 105) is frequently added to the imperative, as to the

jussive, sometimes to soften down a command, or to make a request in a more courteous form
(see above, a), Gn 12:13, 24:2, sometimes to strengthen an exhortation uttered as a rebuke or
threat (Nu 16:26, 20:10) or in ridicule (Is 47:12).

2. The imperative after the desiderative particle ?? Gn 23:13 (at the end of verses 5 and 14
also read ?? for ?? and join it to the following imperative) is due to an anacoluthon. Instead of
the imperfect which would be expected here after ??, the more forcible imperative is used in a
new sentence.

2. The imperative in logical dependence upon a preceding imperative, jussive (or
cohortative), or an interrogative sentence, serves to express the distinct assurance or
promise that an action or state will ensue as the certain consequence of a previous
action. So especially:

(a) The imperative when depending (with w?w copulative) upon another

imperative. In this case the first imperative contains, as a rule, a condition, while the
second declares the consequence which the fulfilment of the condition will involve.
The imperative is used for this declaration, since the consequence is, as a matter of
fact, intended or desired by the speaker (cf. divide et impera), e. g. Gn 42:18  ???? ????
??????? this do, and live, i. e. thus shall ye continue to live. Gn 17:1, 1 K 22:12, 2 K 5:13,
Is 36:16, 45:22 (?? ?????????), Jer 6:16, Am 5:4, 6, Ps 37:27, Pr 3:3f., 4:4, 7:2, 13:20 Keth.,
Jb 2:9, 2 Ch 20:20; in Jer 25:5, Jb 22:21 ??? is added to the first imperative. In other
cases, the first imperative contains a mocking concession, the second an irrevocable
denunciation, e. g. Is 8:9
and ye shall be broken in pieces; cf. verse 9 b.

 (continue to) make an uproar, O ye peoples,

???? ?????? ??

???

???

Rem. 1. If a promise or threat dependent on an imperative be expressed in the 3rd pers.

then the jussive is naturally used instead of the 2nd imperative Is 8:10, 55:2.

2. In Pr 20:13 the second imperative (containing a promise) is attached by asyndeton;
elsewhere two imperatives occur side by side without the copula, where the second might be
expected to be subordinated to the first, e. g. Dt 2:24 ??? ????? (where ??? is virtually, as it were,
an object to ?????) begin, take in possession for to take in possession (cf., however, Ju 19:6
?????? ?????????? be content, I pray thee, and tarry all night, and on this kind of co-ordination in
general, cf. § 120 d). But such imperatives as
????
preceding a second imperative, are for the most part only equivalent to interjections, come!
up!

 (

(b) The imperative, when depending (with w?w copulative) upon a jussive
(cohortative), or an interrogative sentence, frequently expresses also a consequence
which is to be expected with certainty, and often a consequence which is intended, or
in fact an intention; cf. Gn 20:7 and he shall pray for thee, ???????? and thou shalt live;
cf. Ex 14:16, 2 K 5:10, Jb 11:6, Ps 128:5 the Lord bless thee … so that (or in order

that) thou seest, &c.; Ru 1:9, 4:11; after a cohortative, Gn 12:2, 45:18, Ex 3:10 ???????
that thou mayest bring forth; Ex 18:22, 1 S 12:17, 1 K 1:12; Jer 35:15 (after
imperative and jussive); after an interrogative sentence, 2 S 21:3 wherewith shall I
make atonement, ???????? that ye may bless, &c.—In Nu 5:19 the imperative without ??
(in 32:23 with ??) is used after a conditional clause in the sense of a definite promise.

Rem. The 2nd sing. masc. occurs in addressing feminine persons in Ju 4:20 (?????,
according to Qim?i an infinitive, in which case, however, the infinitive absolute ????? should
be read; but probably we should simply read ??????? with Moore), Mi 1:13 and Zc 13:7 (after
?????); and in Is 23:1, the 2nd plur. masc. (On the four forms of the 2nd fem. plur. imperative in
Is 32:11, erroneously explained here in former editions, see now § 48 i). In Na 3:15 the
interchange of masc. and fem. serves to express totality (the nation in all its aspects). Cf.,
moreover, § 145 p on other noticeable attempts to substitute the corresponding masculine
forms for the feminine.

§ 111. The Imperfect with W?w Consecutive.

1. The imperfect with w?w consecutive (§ 49 a–g) serves to express actions,

events, or states, which are to be regarded as the temporal or logical sequel of actions,
events, or states mentioned immediately1 before. The imperfect consecutive is used in
this way most frequently as the narrative tense, corresponding to the Greek aorist or
the Latin historic perfect. As a rule the narrative is introduced by a perfect, and then
continued by means of imperfects with w?w consecutive (on this interchange of tenses
cf. § 49 a, and especially § 112 a), e. g. Gn 3:1 now the serpent was (?????) more subtil
… and he said (????????) unto the woman; 4:1, 6:9ff., 10:9f., 15:19, 11:12ff. 27ff.,
14:5f., 15:1f., 16:1f., 21:1ff., 24:1f., 25:19ff., 36:2ff., 37:2.

Rem. 1. To this class belong some of the numerous imperfects consec. after various
expressions of time, whenever such expressions are equivalent in moaning to a perfect2 (viz.
????? it came to pass), e. g. Is 6:1 in the year that king Uzziah died, I saw (??????????), &c.; Gn
22:4, 27:34, Ju 11:16, 1 S 4:19, 17:57, 21:6, Ho 11:1; on the use of ??????? to connect expressions
of time, see below, g.—It is only in late books or passages that we find the simple perfect in a
clause following an expression of time, as 1 S 17:55 (cf. Driver on the passage), 2 Ch 12:7,
15:8, &c., Dn 10:11, 15:19; the Perfect after ?? and the subject, 2 Ch 7:1.

2. The continuation of the narrative by means of the imperfect consec. may result in a
series of any number of such imperfects, e. g. there are forty-nine in Gn. 1. As soon, however,
as the connecting W?w becomes separated from the verb to which it belongs, by the insertion
of any word, the perfect necessarily takes the place of the imperfect, e. g. Gn 1:5 and God
called (?????????) the light Day, and the darkness he called (
) Night; verse 10, 2:20,
11:3 and frequently.

?? ?? ??

?????
?

???

3. Of two co-ordinate imperfects consecutive the former (as equivalent to a temporal
clause) is most frequently subordinate in sense to the latter, e. g. Gn 28:8f.
 ? ???? ???????
when Esau saw that …, he went, &c.; so also, frequently ??? ??????, &c., Gn 37:21, &c. On the
other hand, a second imperfect consecutive is seldom used in an explanatory sense, e. g. Ex

and Jb 36:7, where it is joined to an abrupt statement of the place.

 for she said); cf. 1 S 7:12. Other examples of the imperfect consecutive, which

2:10 (
apparently represent a progress in the narrative, in reality only refer to the same time, or
explain what precedes, see Gn 2:25 (????????? they were; but Jos 4:9, 1 K 8:8 they are); Gn 36:14
????????
(

), 36:32 (??????????), 1 K 1:44.

4. The imperfect consecutive sometimes has such a merely external connexion with an
immediately preceding perfect, that in reality it represents an antithesis to it, e. g. Gn 32:31
and (yet) my life is preserved; 2 S 3:8 and yet thou chargest me; Jb 10:8, 32:3; similarly in
dependence on noun-clauses, Pr 30:25 ff.

2. The introduction of independent narratives, or of a new section of the narrative,

by means of an imperfect consecutive, likewise aims at a connexion, though again
loose and external, with that which has been narrated previously. Such a connexion is
especially often established by means of ??????? (??? ???????) and it came to pass, after
which there then follows either (most commonly) an imperfect consecutive (Gn 4:3, 8,
8:6, 11:2, Ex 12:29, 13:17, &c.), or W?w with the perfect (separated from it), Gn 7:10,
15:12, 22:1, 27:30, or even a perfect without W?w (Gn 8:13, 14:1f., 40:1, Ex 12:41,
16:22, Nu 10:11, Dt 1:3, 1 S 18:30, 2 K 8:21, &c.), or finally a noun-clause
introduced by W?w, Gn 41:1.

Rem. 1. This loose connexion by means of ????1 is especially common, when the narrative
or a new section of it begins with any expression of time, see above, b; cf., in addition to the
above-mentioned examples (e. g. Gn 22:1 and it came to pass after these things, that God did
prove Abraham), the similar cases in Gn 19:34, 21:22, 1 S 11:11, Ru 1:1. Elsewhere the
statement of time is expressed by ?? or ??   with an infinitive (Gn 12:14, 19:17, 29 39:13, 15:18f.,
Ju 16:25) or by an independent sentence with the perfect (equivalent to a pluperfect, cf. § 106
f), e. g. Gn 15:17, 24:15, 27:30, or by a temporal clause introduced by ??? when, Gn 26:8, 27:1,
Ju 16:16, ? ??????? when, Gn 12:11, 20:13, ???? from the time that, Gn 39:5; or, finally, by a
noun-clause (cf. § 116 u), e. g. 2 K 13:21 ???? ????????? ??? ??????? and it came to pass, as they were
(just) burying a man (prop. they burying), that …; Gn 42:35, 2 K 2:11 (the apodosis in both
these cases being introduced by ???????); 1 S 7:10, 2 S 13:30, 2 K 6:5, 26, 19:37 (=Is 37:38).—In
1 S 10:11, 11:11, 2 S 2:23, 15:2 a noun standing absolutely follows ??????? (as the equivalent of a
complete sentence; see below, h), and then an imperfect consecutive follows.

2. Closely related to the cases noticed in g are those in which the imperfect consecutive,
even without a preceding ????, introduces the apodosis either— (a) to whole sentences, or (b)
to what are equivalent to whole sentences, especially to nouns standing absolutely. As in
certain cases of the perfect consecutive (see § 112 x), so the imperfect consecutive has here
acquired a sort of independent force. Cf. for (a) 1 S 15:23 because thou hast rejected the word
of the Lord, ???????????? he hath rejected thee (cf. Nu 14:16, Is 48:4, where the causal clause
precedes in the form of an infinitive with preposition), Ex 9:21; for (b) Gn 22:24 ??????????? and
(as to) his concubine …,
 she bare, &c.; Ex 38:24, Nu 14:36f., 1 S 14:19, 17:24, 2 S 4:10,
19:41 Keth., 21:16, 1 K 9:20f., 12:17, 2 K 25:22, Jer 6:19, 28:8, 33:24, 4425.2—In 1 K 15:13, 2

????????

1 1 Exhaustive statistics of the use of ???? in its many and various connexions are given
by König in ZAW. 1899, p. 260 ff.
2 2 Cf. the Mêša(cid:31) inscription, l. 5 (Omri) the king of Israel, ????? he oppressed Moab,
&c.—The peculiar imperfect consecutive in Gn 30:27 b (in the earlier editions
explained as equivalent to an object-clause) arises rather from a pregnant brevity of
expression: I have observed and have come to the conclusion, the Lord hath blessed
me, &c.—In Gn 27:34 read, with LXX, ??????? before ???? ????.

K 16:14 the preceding noun, used absolutely, is even regarded as the object of the following
imperfect consecutive, and is therefore introduced by ????.

3. The imperfect consecutive serves, in the cases treated under a–h, to represent
either expressly, or at least to a great extent, a chronological succession of actions or
events; elsewhere it expresses those actions, &c., which represent the logical
consequence of what preceded, or a result arising from it by an inherent necessity.
Thus the imperfect consecutive is used—

(a) As a final summing up of the preceding narrative, e. g. Gn 2:1, 23:20

 ???

?????

??? ???????? so (in this way) the field became (legally) the property of Abraham, &c.; 1 S
17:50, 31:6.

(b) To express a logical or necessary consequence of that which immediately

precedes, e. g. Gn 39:2, Jb 2:3 and he still holdeth fast his integrity,
thou thus (as it now appears) groundlessly movedst me against him; Ps 65:9 so that
they are afraid …; even a consequence which happens conditionally, Jer 20:17 ??????? so
that my mother should have been … Another instance of the kind perhaps (if the text
be correct) is Jer 38:9

????????  so that he dies (must die).

 so that

??? ???
?

?????????

Rem. Such consecutive clauses frequently occur after interrogative sentences, e. g. Is
51:12 who art thou (i. e. art thou so helpless), ??????????? that thou art (must needs be) afraid? Ps
144:3 (cf. Ps 8:5, where in a very similar context ??? that is used with the imperfect); Gn 12:19
(????????); 31:27 ??????? ??????? so that I might have sent thee away.

4. As regards the range of time it is to be carefully noticed—

(a) That the imperfect consecutive may represent all varieties in the relations of
tense and mood, which, according to § 107 a, follow from the idea of the imperfect;

(b) That the more precise determination of the range of time to which an imperfect

consecutive relates must be inferred in each case from the character of the preceding
tense (or tense-equivalent), to which it is attached, in a more or less close relation, as
temporal or logical sequence. Thus the imperfect consecutive serves—

(1) To represent actions, events, or states, which are past (or were repeated in past
time), when it is united with tenses, or their equivalents, which refer to an actual past.

Cf. the examples given above, under a and f, of the imperfect consecutive as an historic

???

??????????

 is the continuation of a preterite, contained, according to the

tense. The imperfect consecutive also frequently occurs as the continuation of a perfect
(preterite) in a subordinate clause; e. g. Gn 27:1, Nu 11:20, Dt 4:37, 1 S 8:8, 1 K 2:5, 11:33,
18:13, &c.; also in Is 49:7
sense, in the preceding ????????. ? ????.—In Jb 31:26, 34 the imperfect consecutive is joined to an
imperfect denoting the past in a conditional sentence. An imperfect consecutive occurs in
dependence on a perfect which has the sense of a pluperfect (§ 106 f), e. g. in Gn 26:18,
28:6f., 31:19, 34 (now Rachel had taken the teraphim,
??? ??  and had put them, &c.); Nu
14:36, 1 S 28:3, 2 S 2:23, Is 39:1. Finally there are the cases in which an infinitival or
participial construction representing past time, according to § 113 r, § 116 x, is taken up and
continued by an imperfect consecutive.

????

(2) To represent present actions, &c., in connexion with tenses, or their

equivalents, which describe actions and states as being either present or lasting on into
the present (continuing in their effect); so especially,

(?) In connexion with the present perfects, described in § 106 g, e. g. Ps 16:9

therefore my heart is glad (??? ??) and my glory rejoiceth (
simple imperfect). Cf. also such examples as Ps 29:10

????????

); Is 3:16 (parallel with a

?????? ??  (prop. he sat down, and

(?) In connexion with those perfects which represent experiences frequently
confirmed (see § 106 k), e. g. Jb 14:2 he cometh up (?????) like a flower, and is cut
down (???????); he fleeth (?????????) also as a shadow,  ??????? ?????
 and continueth not; Jb
20:15, 24:2, 11, Is 40:24, Pr 11:2.

?

(?) In connexion with imperfects which, in one of the ways described in § 107. 2,
are used in the sense of the present; e. g. Jb 14:10 but man dieth (?????) and becometh
powerless (??????????), &c., i. e. remains powerless; Jb 4:5, Ho 8:13, Hb 1:9f., Ps 55:18,
90:3, Jb 5:15, 7:18, 11:3 (when thou mockest), 12:25, 34:24, 37:8 (parallel with a
simple imperfect); 39:15. In the apodosis of a conditional sentence, Ps 59:16, so also
after an interrogative imperfect, 1 S 2:29, Ps 42:6 (?????????? for which in verse 12 and in
43:5 we have ????????????? and why art thou disquieted?).

(?) In dependence on participles, which represent what at present continues or is
being repeated, e. g. Nu 22:11, 1 S 2:6, 2 S 19:2 behold the king weepeth (?????) and
mourneth (??????????) for Absalom; Am 5:8, 9:5f., Na 1:4, Ps 34:8, Pr 20:26, Jb 12:22 ff.,
but cf. e. g. Jb 12:4 ????????? ????? who called upon God,

 and he answered him.

?????????

???

(?) In dependence on other equivalents of the present, as in Is 51:12, Ps 144:3 (see

above, m); Jb 10:22. So especially as the continuation of an infinitive, which is
governed by a preposition (cf. § 144 r), Is 30:12, Jer 10:13, Ps 92:8, &c.

(3) To represent future actions, &c., in dependence on—(?) an imperfect which
refers to the future, Ps 49:15, 94:22f.;—(?) a perfect consecutive, or those perfects
which, according to § 106 n, are intended to represent future events as undoubtedly
certain, and therefore as though already accomplished (perf. propheticum); cf. Is 5:15
(parallel with a simple imperfect separated from ?); 5:16 (cf. 2:11, 17, where the same
threat is expressed by the perfect consecutive); 5:25, 9:5, 10f., 1315.17 ff., 22:7 ff., Jo
2:23, Mi 2:13, Ez 33:4, 6, Ps 7:13, 64:8 ff.;—(?) a future participle, Jer 4:16.1

Rem. An imperfect consecutive in dependence on a perfect or imperfect, which represents

an action occurring only conditionally, is likewise used only in a hypothetical sense, e. g. Jb

1 1 Also in Jer 51:29 the imperfects consecutive are attached to the threat virtually
contained in the preceding imperatives. On the other hand
 Ho 8:10 would be
very remarkable as expressing a future; the text is, however, certainly corrupt, and
hence the Cod. Babyl. and the Erfurt MS. 3 endeavour to remedy it by ?????, and Ewald
reads ????????—In Ez 28:16 (cf. Jer 15:6f.) ????????????? appears to announce an action
irrevocably determined upon, and therefore represented as already accomplished; cf.
the prophetic perfects in verse 17 ff.

??????(cid:31)??

????

????????? ????
????????
?

 if I had called, and he had answered me, yet …; Ps 139:11 ???????? if I

9:16
should say (previously, in verse 8 f., hypothetical imperfects are used).—In Is 48:18f. an
imperfect consecutive occurs in dependence on a sentence expressing a wish introduced by
??? utinam (??????? and it, or so that it were, equivalent to then should it be). Cf. also the
examples mentioned above, under l (Jer 20:17) and m (Gn 31:27), where the imperfect
consecutive expresses facts occurring contingently.

§ 112. The Perfect with W?w Consecutive.

G. R. Berry, ‘Waw consecutive with the perfect in Hebrew,’ in Bibl. Lit., xxii. (1903), pp.
60–69.

1. The perfect, like the imperfect (§ 111), is used with w?w consecutive (cf. § 49
a; on the external differentiation of the perfect consecutive by a change in the position
of the tone, see § 49 h) to express actions, events, or states, which are to be attached to
what precedes, in a more or less close relation, as its temporal or logical consequence.
And as, according to § 111 a, the narrative which begins with a perfect, or its
equivalent, is continued in the imperfect consecutive, so, vice versa, the perfect
consecutive forms the regular continuation to a preceding imperfect, or its equivalent.

Rem. 1. This alternation of perfect and imperfect or their equivalents is a striking

peculiarity of the consecutio temporum in Hebrew. It not only affords a certain compensation
for the lack of forms for tenses and moods, but also gives to Hebrew style the charm of an
expressive variety, an action conceived as being still in progress (imperfect, &c.), reaching
afterwards in the perfect a calm and settled conclusion, in order to be again exhibited in
movement in the imperfect, and vice versa.2 The strict regularity of this alternation belongs
indeed rather to the higher style, and even then it depends upon the view and intention of the
speaker, whether he wishes the action, &c., to be regarded as the logical consequence of what
has preceded, or as simply co-ordinate with it, and so in the same tense.

2. A succession of any number of other perfects consecutive may be co-ordinated with a

perfect consecutive (cf. e.g. Ez 14:13, Am 5:19, Ru 3:3, four perfects in each case, Is 8:7 five,
Ex 6:6f. eight). It is true, however, of the perfect (as conversely of the imperfect, § 112 c),
that as soon as the W?w is separated by any intervening word from the verb to which it
belongs, an imperfect necessarily takes the place of the perfect, e.g. Gn 12:12 when the
Egyptians shall see thee, they shall say (????????), This is his wife: and they will kill me ( ?????????
?????) but thee they will save alive (?????? ????????).

2 2 It is difficult to give a proper explanation of this phenomenon (according to § 49 a,
note, to be found only in the Canaanitish group of languages), when we have given up
the theory of a special w?w conversivum in the unscientific sense mentioned in § 49 b,
note, at the end, and if we accept the fact that the perfect and imperfect consecutive
cannot possibly be used in a way which contradicts their fundamental character as
described in §§ 106 and 107. In other words, even the perfect consecutive originally
represents a finally completed action, &c., just as the imperfect consecutive represents
an action whichis only beginning, becoming or still continuing, and hence in any case
incomplete. The simplest view is to suppose, that the use of the perfect consecutive
originated from those cases, in which it had to express the conclusion (or final
consequence) of an action which was continued (or repeated) in past time (see the
examples above), and that this use was afterwards extended to other cases, in which it
had to represent the temporal or logical consequence of actions, &c., still in progress,
and thus in the end a regular interchange of the two tenses became recognized.

2. The perfect consecutive, like the imperfect consecutive, always belongs to the

period of time expressed by the preceding tense, or its equivalent, with which it is
connected as the temporal or logical consequence. The particular cases may be
classed under three heads: (a) the perfect consecutive in immediate dependence (see
e), (b) in loose connexion (see x) with the preceding, and (c) the perfect consecutive
at the beginning of the apodosis to other sentences, or their equivalents (see ff).

3. The perfect consecutive in immediate dependence on the preceding tense, or its

equivalent, serves

(a) As a frequentative tense to express past actions, &c., i.e. actions repeatedly

brought to a conclusion in the past, and follows tenses, or their equivalents,
representing actions which have continued or been repeated in the past:

(?) After a simple imperfect, e.g. Gn 2:6 ???????? ??? there went up a mist (again and
again) from the earth, ??? ?????? and watered (as it were, and ever watered afresh), &c.
This frequentative use of the perfect consecutive is equally evident after frequentative
imperfects, Gn 2:10 (??????? and it became again every time; ??????? would mean, and it
became so once for all); 29:2f. (four perfects consecutive referring to actions repeated
daily); Ex 33:7–11 ????? he used to take at each new encampment the tent, ??????? and to
pitch it again every time without the camp; notice, amongst the numerous frequent.
perff. consec., the imperf. in vv. 7, 8, 9, 11, always in a frequentative sense; 34:34f.,
Nu 9:19, 21 (among several simple imperfects), 10:17, Ju 2:19, 1 S 2:19 ? ??????? she
used to make … ???????????? and brought it to him from year to year; 27:9 (???????), 1 K
14:28, 2 K 3:25, 12:15 (in verses 16f. imperfects occur again). So also in dependent
sentences, Gn 6:4 (????????? as a continuation of ??????), Jb 31:29.1

(?) After an imperfect consecutive, e.g. Ex 39:3 (Samaritan ?????), 1 S 5:7 (? see §

112 rr), 7:16, 2 S 15:2, 5, 16:13 and he threw stones at him, ??????? and east dust
continually; 12:16, 31, 2 K 6:10, 12:11 ff. 15, Jer 37:15, Jb 1:5.

Rem. The frequentative perfect consecutive is sometimes joined even with imperfects
consecutive which simply express one single action or occurrence in the past; thus Ex 18:26,
40:31 f., 1 S 1:4, 2 S 15:1 f., 1 K 14:27 (cf. verse 28); 1 K 18:4, 2 K 12:10. For other
examples of a loosely connected frequentative perfect consecutive, see below, dd.

(?) After a perfect, Gn 37:3 (?? ? ??????, i.e. as often as he needed a new garment)2;
Gn 31:7, Nu 11:8, 1 S 16:14, 2 K 3:4, Ps 22:6; 3 in interrogative sentences, 1 S 26:9
who has ever, &c.; Ps 80:13, Jb 1:1, 4, Ru 4:7.

1 1 Also in Ez 44:12 (where Stade, ZAW. v. 293, would read ????? ?? and ?????????) the
unusual tenses may have been intentionally chosen: because they continually
ministered and so always became afresh …
2 2 Driver, on this passage, rightly refers to 1 S 2:19.
3 3 Am 4:7 would also come under this head, if
statement refers to the past;
positive assurance (§ 106 m), and the passage would then come under s.

 might, however, also be a perfect expressing

????(cid:31)?????

????????????

(cid:31)?

 is really intended, and the

(?) After an infinitive, Am 1:11 ?????????? because he did pursue his brother, ??? ????
and (on each occasion) did east off all pity (then an imperfect consecutive); after an
infinitive absolute, Jos 6:13, 2 S 13:19, Jer 23:14.

(?) After a participle, Is 6:3 (???????), &c., frequentative, as a continuation of ?????????,

verse 2); 1 S 2:22, 2 S 17:17.4

(?) After other equivalents of tenses, e.g. Gn 47:22 the priests had a portion from

Pharaoh, ???????? and did eat (year by year), &c.; 1 K 4:7.

(b) To express present actions, &c., as the temporal or logical consequence of
actions or events which continue or are repeated in the present, especially such as
have, according to experience, been at all times frequently repeated, and may be
repeated at any time:

(?) After a simple imperfect, e.g. Gn 2:24 therefore a man leaves (???????? is

accustomed to leave) … ??????? and cleaves, &c., here, as frequently elsewhere, clearly
with the secondary idea of purpose, i.e. in order to cleave; Is 5:11 (if ??????? is to be
taken as a continuation of ??????????); Is 28:28, Jer 12:3, Ho 4:3, 7:7, Ps 90:6, Jb 14:9;
also in dependent clauses, Lv 20:18, Is 29:8, 11 f., Am 5:19.

(?) After a participle, as the equivalent of a sentence representing a contingent
action, &c., e.g. Ex 21:12 ????? ???? ????? (instead of ????? there is in verse 20, &c.  ????? ?????
????) if one smite a man and (so that) he die, &c., Ex 21:16, Is 29:15, Am 6:1, Hb
2:12.

(?) After an infinitive absolute, Jer 7:9 f. will ye steal, murder, and commit
adultery (simple infinitives absolute; cf. § 113 ee), ??????? and then come and stand
before me … and say, &c.; cf. below, u.

(c) To express future actions, &c., as the temporal or logical consequence of
tenses, or their equivalents, which announce or require such future actions or events.
Thus—

(?) After imperfects in the sense of a simple future, e.g. Am 9:3 f.  ??????? ??????
??????????? I will search and take them out thence, &c.; Gn 4:14, 40:13, Ex 7:3, 1 S
17:32, 2 K 5:11, Jb 8:6 f. (also with a change of subject, Gn 27:12, Ju 6:16, &c.); and
in interrogative sentences, Gn 39:9, Ex 2:7, 2 S 12:18, 2 K 14:10, Am 8:8, Ps 41:6; cf.
also Ru 1:11; in sentences expressing a wish, 2 S 15:4; as well as in almost all kinds
of dependent clauses. Also in conditional clauses after ???? Gn 32:9, Ex 19:5, 1 S 1:11,
 Gn 12:13, Nu 15:40, Is 28:13;
or ??? Gn 37:26, or ??? Jer 3:1; in final clauses after
after ? ???? Dt 2:25, or ???? Gn 3:22, 19:19, 32:12, Is 6:10, Am 5:6; in temporal clauses,
Is 32:15, Jer 13:16; and in relative clauses, Gn 24:14, Ju 1:12, 1 S 17:26.

????????

4 4 That ??????????, &c., are frequentatives (the maidservant used to go repeatedly and tell
them) may be seen from ??????? (necessarily an imperfect, since it is separated from ?? by
???) and ???????; on the other hand in verse 18 ??????? and ????????? of actions which happened
only once.

(?) After the jussive (or an imperfect in the sense of a jussive or optative) or
 ??????? ?????

cohortative, with the same or a different subject, e.g. Gn 1:14 f.
there be lights … and let them be, &c.; Gn 24:4, 28:3, 31:44, 1 K 1:2, 22:13, Ru 2:7, 1
Ch 22:11; after a jussive expressing an imprecation, Ps 109:10.

 let

??????

 ...

(?) After an imperative, also with the same or a different subject, e.g. 2 S 7:5  ????
?????????? go and tell (that thou mayst tell), &c., and often, perf. consec. after ???? (as also
the perf. consec. of ???? and ????? very frequently follows other imperatives); Gn 6:14,
8:17, 27:43 f., 1 S 15:3, 18, 1 K 2:36, Jer 48:26.

(?) After perfects which express a definite expectation or assurance (cf. § 106 m
 behold, I have blessed him, and will
???? ?????

and n), e.g. Gn 17:20
make him fruitful, &c.; Is 2:11, 5:14; on Am 4:7 see above, note 3 on h; in an
interrogative sentence, Ju 9:9, 11:13.

???? ??????????? ???? ?????

?

(?) After a participle, e.g. Gn 7:4 for yet seven days, ???????? ??????? and I will cause it

?????

????
?

 and I will (i.e. in order to) destroy, &c.; Jer 21:9; also with a

to rain …
???? ???????
different subject, Gn 24:43 f. the maiden which cometh forth (????????) …
to whom I shall say …, ????????? and she (then) shall say, &c. This use of the perfect
consecutive is especially frequent after a participle introduced by ?????, e.g. Gn 6:17 f.;
with a different subject 1 K 20:36, Am 6:14; after a complete noun-clause introduced
by ????? (cf. § 140), Ex 3:13 behold, I come (i.e. if I shall come) … ????? ??????????? and shall
say unto them …, ???????? and they (then) shall say, &c.; 1 S 14:8 ff., Is 7:14, 8:7 f.,
39:6.

????

????

(?) After an infinitive absolute, whether the infinitive absolute serves to strengthen

the finite verb (see § 113 t), e.g. Is 31:5, or is used as an emphatic substitute for a
cohortative or imperfect (§ 113 dd and ee), e.g. Lv 2:6, Dt 1:16, Is 5:5, Ez 23:46 f.

(?) After an infinitive construct governed by a preposition (for this change from

the infinitive construction to the finite verb, cf. § 114 r), e.g. 1 S 10:8
???? ???????????? till I come unto thee (prop. until my coming) and show thee, &c.; Gn 18:25,
27:45, Ju 6:18, Ez 39:27; cf. 1 K 2:37, 42.

???? ?????????

 ???

?

Rem. To the same class belong 1 S 14:24, where the idea of time precedes, until it be
evening and until I be avenged, &c., and Is 5:8, where the idea of place precedes, in both
cases governed by ????.

4. The very frequent use of the perfect consecutive in direct dependence upon
other tenses (see above, d–v) explains how it finally obtained a kind of independent
force—especially for the purpose of announcing future events—and might depend
loosely on sentences to which it stood only in a wider sense in the relation of a
temporal or logical consequence. Thus the perfect consecutive is used—

(a) To announce future events, &c., in loose connexion with a further
announcement, e.g. Gn 41:30 ?????? and two co-ordinate perfects consecutive,
equivalent to but then shall arise, &c.; frequently so after ????? with a following
substantive (1 S 9:8), or a participial clause (cf. the analogous instances above, under
t), e.g. 1 S 2:31 behold, the days come, ???????????? that I will cut off, &c.; Is 39:6, Am 4:2,

8:11, 9:13, and very often in Jeremiah; after an expression of time, Ex 17:4, Is 10:25,
29:17, Jer 51:33, Ho 1:4. Further, when joined to a statement concerning present or
past facts, especially when these contain the reason for the action, &c., expressed in
the perfect consecutive; cf. Is 6:7 lo, this hath touched thy lips, ????? therefore thine
iniquity shall be taken away, &c. (not copulative and it is taken away, since it is
parallel with a simple imperfect), Gn 20:11, 26:22, Ju 13:3 (here in an adversative
sense); Ho 8:14. In loose connexion with a noun-clause, a long succession of perfects
consecutive occurs in Ex 6:6 ff. Also in Amos 5:26 ???? ????? may be an announcement
yea, ye shall take up; but cf. below, rr.

Rem. 1. Very frequently the announcement of a future event is attached by means of ???????1

and it shall come to pass (cf. the analogous continuation in the past by means of ???????, § 111,
2), after which the event announced (sometimes after a long parenthesis) follows in one or
more (co-ordinate) perfects consecutive, Gn 9:14, 12:12 (??? ???????=if, as in 46:33, Ex 1:10,
22:26 and frequently), 1 K 18:12, Is 14:3 f., Am 8:9; or in the imperfect, Gn 4:14, Is 2:2, 3:24,
4:3, 7:18, 21 ff. (cf. 29:8); or in the jussive, Lv 14:9. It very rarely happens that the verb
which is thus loosely added, agrees in gender and number with the following subject, as in Nu
5:27, Jer 42:16 ?????????? (before

), and in Jer 42:17 ???????? (before ?? ?????????????).

????????

2. The jussive form ?????? occurs (in the sense described in y) instead of ??????? in 1 S 10:5, 2 S

5:24 (1 Ch 14:15), 1 K 14:5, Ru 3:4, although in the first three places a jussive is wholly
inadmissible in the context, and even in Ru 3:4 (where an admonition follows) ??????? would be
expected (see below, bb). In 1 K 14:5 the form is a textual error, and the pointing should
simply be ???????. In the other passages ???? (always before an infinitive with a preposition) stands
at the beginning of the sentence at an unusually long distance from the principal tone, and
hence is certainly to be explained according to § 109 k, except that in 1 S 10:5, &c., the
simply rhythmical jussive form takes the place, not of the full imperfect form, but
(exceptionally) of the perfect consecutive.

(b) To introduce a command or wish: Dt 10:19 love ye therefore the stranger; 1 S

6:5, 24:16, 1 K 2:6 (in Gn 40:14 the precative perfect consecutive, as elsewhere the
cohortative, jussive, and imperative, is strengthened by means of ???). So, also, in loose
connexion with participial and other noun-clauses (see above, x), Gn 45:12 f., 1 K 2:2
f., Ru 3:3 f., 3:9.—In Gn 17:11 the perfect consecutive (?????????? and ye shall be
circumcised, &c.) is used to explain a preceding command.

Rem. As in the cases mentioned above under y, the connexion may be made by means of

???????. Thus with a following perfect consecutive, e.g. Gn 46:33, 47:24, Ju 4:20. Cf. also Gn
24:14, where the real wish, at least as regards the sense, is contained in the next sentence.

(c) To introduce a question, whether in loose connexion with another interrogative
sentence (see above, p), e.g. Gn 29:15 art thou my brother (equivalent to, Surely thou
art),
statement, e.g. Ex 5:5 (????? ?????? will ye then make them rest?); Nu 16:10, 1 S 25:11,
and (if it is Milera(cid:31)) Ps 50:21 (??? ???????????).

 and shouldest thou then serve me for naught? or with a positive

???????????

????

(d) To introduce actions frequently repeated hence analogous to the numerous
examples of a frequentative perfect consecutive, above, under e), e.g. 1 S 1:3 (??????? of
annual festival journeys); 13:21 (where, however, the text appears radically corrupt);

1 1 On the various combinations with ??????? see König’s statistics in ZAW. xix. 272 ff.

27:9 (???????, i.e. every time, therefore continued by means of ??????? ?????); 1 K 5:7 (??????????,
parallel with a simple imperfect); 9:25, Jer 25:4, Ho 12:11, Dn 8:4.—In Jb 1:4 f. a
series of frequentative perfects consecutive is interrupted by an imperfect consecutive,
while a simple imperfect (as the modus rei repetitae) forms the conclusion. In Jer 6:17
a similar perfect is expressly marked, by placing the tone on the final syllable
(according to § 49 h), as parallel with the real perfects consecutive.

Rem. The loose connexion of tempora frequentativa by ??????? (cf. the Rem. on y and bb) is
also very common in this sense; thus with a following perfect consecutive, Gn 30:41 f. (but in
verse 42a, where the verb is separated from the W?w by an insertion, we find ?? ???? ??? he used
not to put them in, according to § 107 e); Gn 38:9, Ex 17:11, 33:7 ff. (see above, e), Nu 21:9,
Ju 6:3, 19:30, 1 S 16:23 (followed by five perfects consecutive); 2 S 15:5; with a following
imperfect (as the modus rei repetitae), Ju 2:19, 2 S 14:26.—In Ju 12:5 f. ????, contrary to what
would be expected, is continued by means of the imperfect consecutive, and in 1 S 13:22 by
????? with the perfect (instead of the imperfect).

5. Further, the perfect consecutive is very frequently employed with a certain

emphasis to introduce the apodosis after sentences (or their equivalents) which
contain a condition, a reason, or a statement of time. Such an apodosis, as in the cases
already treated, may represent either future events, or commands and wishes, or even
events which have been often repeated in the past. Thus—

(a) The perfect consecutive occurs in the apodosis to conditional sentences1 (§ 159

g, o, s):

(?) After ??? with the imperfect, e.g. 2 K 7:4b

????????? ??

???????????

 if they kill us, (well

?

then) we shall but die; here the perfect consecutive is used obviously with greater
emphasis than the imperfect (???????) which immediately precedes; Gn 18:26, 24:8, 41,
32:9, Nu 30:15, Ju 4:20, 1 S 1:11, 20:6, 1 K 3:14, Na 3:12, Ec 4:11.

(?) After ??? with the perfect (in the sense of a futurum exactum), Nu 5:27, 2 K
5:20, 74a, Is 4:4 f.; as precative apodosis after ??????? with the perf. preteritum, Gn
33:10; as a frequentative perfect consecutive, to represent past events in the apodosis
after ??? with a perfect, Gn 38:9, Nu 21:9, Ju 6:3, Jb 7:4; after ??? with imperfect, Gn
31:8.

(?) After ??? (in case, suppose that) with the imperfect, Gn 12:12, Ex 18:16, Ju

13:17, Is 58:7, Ez 14:13.2 Frequentative with reference to the past, after ??? with
frequentative perfect, Ju 2:18, Jb 7:13f.

(?) After ? ???? with the imperfect, Gn 44:9

 with whomsoever …
it be found, let him die; with the perfect, Ex 21:13 and if a man lie not in wait, &c.; Ju
1:12.

 ???? ???????

 ? ????

?????

 ...

1 1 In a number of the examples of this kind the protasis is already loosely connected
by means of ????, and hence some of them had to be already mentioned above, under
y, bb, ee.
2 2 In 1 S 24:19 a question appears to be expressed by the perfect consecutive, for if a
man find his enemy, will he let him go well away? Probably, however, with
Klostermann, ???? should be read for ?????.

?

(?) Very frequently after a perfect consecutive (one or more) containing the
 … ??????????? ?????????? and if ye take (or shall have

condition, e.g. Gn 44:29  ???????????
taken) this one also … ye shall bring down, &c.; cf. Gn 33:13, 42:38, 44:4, 22, 47:30,
Nu 30:12, Ru 2:9, and probably also Ez 39:28.—Also frequentative in reference to the
past, e.g. 1 S 17:34 f. …
happened) a lion … I went out, &c.; Ex 33:10, Nu 10:17 ff., 1 K 18:10, Jer 20:9 (the
perfects consecutive being regularly continued in the apodosis by ????? with an
imperfect1).

 and when there came (as sometimes

Rem. The perfect consecutive may be used also in the protasis to express a condition
when the employment of the perfect consecutive in the apodosis has become impossible,
?????? ;
owing to an emphatic word having to stand before it; thus in Ez 14:14 on account of
33:4 on account of ????.—In 1 S 14:52 the imperfect consecutive, contrary to what might be
expected, stands in the apodosis, and when Saul saw any … valiant man, he took him unto
him, where
Conversely, in 1 S 2:16 (????????? perhaps a mere mistake for ??????), 17:35 b an imperfect

 suggests the special case, rather than a repeated occurrence; cf. 2 S 15:2.

??????????

(?) After various equivalents of sentences, which contain a condition; thus, after a
 ????? ???????

substantive standing absolutely, or a participle (a casus pendens), Gn 17:14
??? ??????????? and the uncircumcised male (in case such an one be found), he shall be cut
off, &c.; cf. Gn 30:32, Ex 12:15, 2 S 14:10, Is 6:13, and (after an infinitive with a
preposition) 2 S 7:14; in a wider sense also Ex 4:21, 9:19, 12:44, Is 9:4, 56:5.

(b) The perfect consecutive serves as the apodosis to causal clauses; thus e.g. after

consecutive relating to the past, as in Ex 1:19; also after participial clauses (§ 116 w),
e.g. 1 S 2:13 f.
 when(ever) any man offered sacrifice, then
came, &c. (so Ju 19:30, 2 S 20:12), with a frequentative perfect consecutive. The
perfect consecutive is very frequently used to announce future actions or events after
simple expressions of time of any kind; thus Gn 3:5, Ex 32:34 (after ????? with the
infinitive), cf. also such examples as Gn 44:31, Ju 16:2, Jos 6:10, 1 S 1:22, 16:23
(numerous frequentative perfects consecutive after the infinitive with a preposition; so
2 S 15:5, see above, ee); 1 S 20:18, 2 S 14:26, 15:10, Is 18:5; moreover, Ex 17:4, Is
10:25, 29:17, 37:26; even after single disconnected words, e.g. Ex 16:6
???
even (when it becomes evening) then ye shall know; cf. verse 7, Lv 7:16, 1 K 13:31,
Pr 24:27.

??????????? ???  at

1 1 In all these examples (not only in the frequentative perfects consecutive) the
original idea of the perfect, which also underlies the perfect consecutive, comes out
very distinctly. Gn 44:29 (see above) implies in the mind of the speaker, If it ever
shall have come to this, that ye have taken this one also, then ye have thereby brought
me down to Sheol.

6. Finally there still remains a number of passages which cannot be classed with
any of those hitherto mentioned. Of these, some are due to the influence of Aramaic
modes of expression, while in others the text is evidently corrupt.1 In a few instances
we can do no more than merely call attention to the incorrectness of the expression.
(We are not of course concerned here with the cases—usually occurring in dependent
clauses—in which a 2nd pers. perf. with W?w copulative is simply co-ordinate with
what precedes, as in Gn 28:6, and probably Nu 21:15, Dt 33:2.)

(a) The influence of the Aramaic construction of the perfect with ?? as the narrative tense,
instead of the Hebrew imperfect consecutive (cf. Kautzsch, Gramm. des Bibl.-Aram., § 71 b),
is certainly to be traced in Qoheleth, and sporadically in other very late books,2 perhaps also
in a few passages in the hooks of Kings, which are open to the suspicion of being due to later
interpolation; so probably 1 K 12:32 ????????????; 2 K 11:1 Keth. ?????; 14:14 ??????? (in the parallel
passage, 2 Ch 25:24, the word is wanting); 2 K 23:4 ? ??????, &c.; verse 10 ???????, &c.; verse 12
????? ??????, &c.; verse 15 ??? ????, &c.3 Cf. also Ez 37:2, 7, 10.

(b) The text is certainly corrupt in Is 40:6 (read with the LXX and Vulgate ????????); Jer
38:28, where the narrative breaks off in the middle of the sentence; 40:3 (???????, &c., wanting in
the LXX); also in Ju 7:13
???? ???????
Klostermann, the 2nd sing. masc. instead of ??????; in 1 K 21:12

???

Of other questionable instances, (?) the following, at any rate, may also be explained as

frequentatives, Gn 21:25, 49:23, Ex 36:38, 38:28, 39:3, 1 S 5:7, 17:20, 24:11 (but even so
???????? would be expected); 2 K 23:12, Is 28:26 (parallel with an imperfect); Am 5:26 (unless it
is rather, yea, ye shall take up; see above, x); Ps 26:3, Ezr 8:36.

(?) A longer or constant continuance in a past state is perhaps represented by the perfect
with ?? (as a variety of the frequentative perfect with ??), in Gn 15:6, 34:5, Nu 21:20, Jos 9:12,
22:3b, Is 22:14, Jer 3:9. But the unusual perfects consec. in Jos 15:3–11, 16:2–8 (ultimately
parallel with an imperf. as in 17:9, 18:20), 18:12–21, 19:11–14.22.26–29.34, are without
doubt rightly explained by Bennett (SBOT., Joshua, p. 23) as originally containing the
directions either of God to Joshua or of Joshua to the people; cf. the evident trace of this in

1 1 Mayer Lambert, REJ. xxvi. 55, is probably right in pointing some of these forms
as infin. abs. instead of perfects.
2 2 In the whole of Qoheleth the imperfect consecutive occurs only in 1:17 and 4:1, 7.
Several of the perfects with ?? can no doubt be explained as frequentatives, e.g. 1:13,
2:5, 9, 11, 13, 15, 5:18, compared with 6:2; but this is impossible in such passages as
9:14 ff. In Ezra, Driver reckons only six examples of the historical perfect with ??, in
Nehemiah only six, and in Esther six or seven.
3 3 Stade in ZAW. v. 291 ff. and in Ausgeäwhlte akad. Reden, Giessen, 1899, p. 194 ff.
and appendix p. 199, discusses, in connexion with 2 K 12:12, a number of critically
questionable perfects with ??. He considers that the whole section, 2 K 23:4 from ? ??????
to verse 5 inclusive, is to be regarded as a gloss, since the continuation of an imperfect
consecutive by means of a perfect with ?? never occurs in pre-exilic documents, except
in places where it is due to corruption of the original text. The theory of frequentative
perfects consecutive (even immediately after imperfects consecutive), which has been
supported above, under f and g, by a large number of examples, is quite inconsistent

THE INFINITIVE AND PARTICIPLE.

§ 113. The Infinitive Absolute.

Cf. the dissertation of J. Kahan, and, especially, the thorough investigation by E. Sellin,
both entitled, Ueber die verbal-nominals Doppelnatur der hebräischen Participien und
Infinitive, &c., Lpz. 1889; F. Prätorius, ‘Ueber die sogen. Infin. absol. des Hebr.’ in
ZDMG. 1902, pp. 546 ff.

1. The infinitive absolute is employed according to § 45 to emphasize the idea of
the verb in the abstract, i.e. it speaks of an action (or state) without any regard to the
agent or to the circumstances of time and mood under which it takes place. As the
name of an action the infinitive absolute, like other nouns in the stricter sense, may
form part of certain combinations (as a subject, predicate, or object, or even as a
genitive,1 see below); but such a use of the infinitive absolute (instead of the infinitive
construct with or without a preposition) is, on the whole, rare, and, moreover, open to
question on critical grounds. On the other hand, the infinitive absolute frequently
exhibits its character as an expression of the verbal idea by taking an object, either in
the accusative or even with a preposition.

Examples of the use of the infinitive absolute:—

(a) As subject, Pr 25:27

 ??????? ????? ????
Jb 6:25, Ec 4:17; epexegetically, after a demonstrative pronoun, Is 58:5 f., Zc 14:12.

 it is not good to eat much honey; Jer 10:5,

??? ???

(b) As predicate, Is 32:17 and the effect of righteousness (is)

to find rest) and confidence.

????

???? ??? ????

 quietness (prop.

1 1 Or does ????, as a frequentative, imply fastening with several bolts? It is, at all
events, to be noticed, that in 2 S 13:18 also ???? follows an imperfect consecutive.
ZDMG. ZDMG. = Zeitschrift der deutschen morgenländischen Gesellschaft, Lpz.
1846 ff., since 1903 ed. by A. Fischer.
1 1 The infinitive absolute can never be joined with a genitive or a pronominal suffix.

(c) As object, Is 1:17 ?????? ?????? learn to do well; Is 7:15, Pr 15:12, Jb 9:18; according to
the sense also Jer 9:23 23:14, as well as Is 5:5 (????? and ????? virtually depend on the idea of
the wish contained in ? ????); Is 22:13, where a long series of infinitives absolute is governed
by ?????, and 59:13 (six infinitives governed by ?????????? in verse 12); Dt 28:56 is strange since
the object precedes the infinitive absolute which governs it,2 also Is 42:24, where the
statement of place precedes the infinitive absolute.—In Jer 9:4, Jb 13:3 the infinitive absolute
as the object of the verb is placed before it for the sake of emphasis (with the verb negatived
by ??? in Is 57:20, Jer 49:23), so also in La 3:45 where it is the remoter object and co-
ordinated with a substantive.

(d) As genitive, Is 14:23 ??? ???? ??????????? with the besom of destruction; so perhaps also 4:4

????? ??????; cf. further, Pr 1:3, 21:16. The infinitive absolute is never used in immediate
connexion with prepositions3 (which as being originally substantives govern the genitive), but
always the infinitive construct; but if a second infinitive is co-ordinated by ?? with such an
infinitive construct, it has the form of the infinitive absolute (since it is released from the
immediate government of the preposition), e.g. 1 S 22:13 … ?????????? ?? ??? ???? ????? ?? ???????? in
that thou hast given him bread … and hast enquired of God for him; Ez 36:3; 1 S 25:26, 33
(after ???); after ?? Ex 32:6, Jer 7:18, 44:17.

(e) Governing an accusative of the object, e.g. Is 22:13 ???? ??? ???? ????? ????? slaying oxen
and killing sheep; cf. Ex 20:8, 23:30, Dt 5:12, Is 37:19, Ez 23:30, and of the examples in a–d,
Dt 28:56 Is 5:5, 58:6 f., Pr 25:27, &c.; followed by a preposition, e.g. Is 7:15  ?????? ????? ?????
????? to refuse the evil and choose the good; Pr 15:12 (?? ??????).

If the object be a personal pronoun, then, since the infinitive absolute can never be united
with a suffix (see the note on a), it is affixed by means of the accusative-sign ??? (???), e.g. Jer
9:23 ????? ???????? and knoweth me; Ez 36:3.

2. Analogous to the use of the infinitive absolute as the accusative of the object,

mentioned in d, is its employment as a casus adverbialis1 in connexion with some
form of the finite verb, to describe more particularly the manner or attendant
circumstances (especially those of time and place) under which an action or state has
taken place, or is taking place, or will take place; e.g. Jer 22:19 he shall be buried
with the burial of an ass, ???? ?????? ????? a drawing and casting forth, i.e. being drawn and
cast forth, &c.; Gn 21:16 (??????? a removing, i.e. distant; cf. Ex 33:7, Jos 3:16); Gn
30:32, Ex 30:36, Nu 6:5, 23, 15:35 (where a subject is added subsequently; see below,
gg); Jos 3:17, 1 S 3:12 (??????? ????? a beginning and ending, i.e. from beginning to end);
2 S 8:2, Is 7:11 (???????? and ????????, prop. a making deep …, and a making high, i.e.
whether thy request extend to the world below or to the height above); 57:17 (??????? in
hiding, sc. my face); Jer 3:15 (???? ?????? ????? with knowledge and understanding); Hb

2 2 Perhaps ????? according to § 53 k should be explained as an infinitive construct, or
should be written ?????.
3 3 ??? ?? ????? 1 S 1:9 is impossible Hebrew, and as the LXX shows, a late addition.
1 1 That this casus adverbialis also was originally regarded as an accusative, may be
seen from classical Arabic, where an infinitive of this kind expressly retains the
accusative ending. In Latin the ablative of the gerund corresponds in many ways to
this use of the infinitive absolute.

3:13 (?????, for the form cf. § 75 aa); Zc 7:3, Ps 35:16 (?????, to define more precisely
??????? verse 15); Jb 15:3.2

Rem. 1. To an adverbial infinitive absolute of this kind, there may further be added a
casus adverbialis (the accusative of state or circumstance), or even a circumstantial clause, to
define more exactly the manner in which the action is performed, e.g. Is 20:2 and he did so
??????? ????? ?????? walking naked and barefoot, prop. in the condition of one naked, &c.; Is 30:14
a breaking in pieces (acc. to the reading ?????; the Masora requires ?????) without sparing.

2. A few infinitives of this kind, all of which are in Hipheîl, have, through frequent use,
come to be treated by the language as simple adverbs; so especially ??????? (cf. § 75 ff) multum
faciendo, i.e. multum, very frequently strengthened by ????? very and even used without
connexion with a finite verb (see the Lexicon); also ?????? bene faciendo, i.e. bene, used
especially to express the careful and thorough performance of an action (e.g. Dt 13:15); in Dt
9:21, 27:8 it is added epexegetically to another adverbial infinitive absolute, in Jon 4:9 it
twice precedes the verb for the sake of emphasis. Finally, ??? ???? mane faciendo, i.e. early in
the morning, then in general early with the additional idea of earnestness; in 1 S 17:16 joined
with the infinitive absolute ?????????? a denominative from
i.e. early and late), elsewhere (with the exception of Pr 27:14) always joined with the
infinitive absolute of the governing verb, e.g. Jer 11:7 for I earnestly protested (
your fathers …
26:5 (where ?? should be omitted before ??); Jer 29:19, 32:33, 2 Ch 16:15.

) unto
 rising early and protesting, i.e. with earnest protestation; Jer 25:3,

??????  evening (morning and evening,

??? ????

???????

???????

????

3. The infinitive absolute occurs most frequently in immediate connexion with the
finite verb of the same stem, in order in various ways to define more accurately or to
strengthen the idea of the verb.1

These infinitives absolute joined immediately to the finite verb belong in a sense to the
schema etymologicum treated in § 117 p, i.e. they are objects of the finite verb in question,
except that the infinitive absolute (as a nomen abstractum) lays stress rather on the actual
occurrence or the energy of the action (see the examples below), while the noun proper
emphasizes the result or extent of the action; cf. e.g. Ex 22:22 ????? ??????? ????????? if it actually
happens that he cries to me, with Gn 27:34 (as it were, he cried, so that a great cry was
heard).

We must further distinguish—

(a) The infinitive absolute used before the verb to strengthen the verbal idea, i.e.
to emphasize in this way either the certainty (especially in the case of threats) or the
forcibleness and completeness of an occurrence. In English, such an infinitive is
mostly expressed by a corresponding adverb, but sometimes merely by putting greater
stress on the verb; e.g. Gn 2:17 ????? ??? thou shalt surely die, cf. 18:10, 18, 22:17,
28:22, 1 S 9:6 (cometh surely to pass); 24:21, Am 5:5, 7:17, Hb 2:3, Zc 11:17; with

2 2 Also in 2 K 21:13 for ???????? ????? read with Stade and Klostermann ???????? ?????;
similarly, with Stade, ??????? in Ju 4:24; ??????? in Jer 23:14, and on Is 31:5 cf. t.

such constructions in the Greek and Latin versions.

???

?? ????? ?????

the infinitive strengthened by ??? Gn 44:28 (but 27:30 and Jacob was yet scarce gone
out, &c.); Gn 43:3
 he did solemnly protest unto us; 1 S 20:6 ?? ???? ??? ????
David earnestly asked leave of me; Jos 17:13, Ju 1:28 ???????? ??? ???????? and did not
utterly drive them out; especially typical instances are Am 9:8 I will destroy it from off
the face of the earth
??? ???? ??? ???? ???? ??? ??? ???  saving that I will not utterly destroy,
&c.; Jer 30:11 and will in no wise leave thee unpunished; cf. further Gn 20:18, 1 K
3:26, Jo 1:7, Jb 13:5.

???

The infinitive absolute is used before the verb with less emphasis:

(1) Frequently at the beginning of the statement; cf. Driver on 1 S 20:6. However,

in these cases a special emphasis on the following verb is sometimes intended; cf.
above, n, on Gn 43:3, 1 S 20:6; also Gn 3:16, 26:28, 32:17, 1 S 14:28, 20:3.
Elsewhere the infinitive absolute is evidently used only as possessing a certain
fullness of sound (hence for rhythmical reasons, like some uses of the separate
pronoun, § 135 a), as in Gn 15:13, 43:7, 20, Ju 9:8, 1 S 10:16, 23:10, 2 S 1:6, 20:18.

(2) Very frequently in conditional sentences after ???, &c. The infinitive absolute
in this case emphasizes the importance of the condition on which some consequence
depends, e.g. Ex 15:26 if thou wilt diligently hearken, &c., Ex 19:5, 21:5, 22:3, 11 f.
16, 22 (see above, m); 23:22, Nu 21:2, Ju 16:11, 1 S 1:11, 12:25; after ?? 1 S 14:30.

The infinitive absolute is used to give emphasis to an antithesis, e.g. 2 S 24:24
nay; but I will verily buy (??????? ????) it of thee, &c. (not receive it as a gift); Ju 15:13
no; but we will bind thee fast … but surely we will not kill thee; cf. further Gn 31:30
(thou art indeed gone=) though thou wouldst needs be gone (Vulg. esto), because thou
sore longedst, &c.; Ps 118:13, 18, 126:6 (the second infinitive absolute as a
supplement to the first—see below, r—comes after the verb).—Hence also, as
permissive, Gn 2:16 f. ?????? ???? thou mayest freely eat, but, &c. (so that verse 16 is
in antithesis to verse 17); or concessive, 1 S 2:30 I said indeed …, 14:43.

The infinitive absolute is used to strengthen a question, and especially in

 shalt thou indeed
impassioned or indignant questions, e.g. Gn 37:8
reign over us? Gn 37:10, 43:7, Ju 11:25, 1 S 2:27, 2 S 19:43, Jer 3:1, 13:12, Ez 28:9,
Am 3:5, Zc 7:5; but cf. also Gn 24:5 must I needs bring again?

?? ???????? ????????

?????
?

(b) The infinitive absolute after the verb, sometimes (as in n) to intensify1 the idea

of the verb (especially after imperatives and participles, since the infinitive absolute
can never precede either, e.g. Nu 11:15, Jb 13:17, 21:2, 37:2 ???? ?? ???? ?? hearken ye
attentively; Jer 22:10; after participles, e.g. Is 22:17, also elsewhere, e.g. Nu 23:11,
24:10 thou hast altogether blessed them; Jos 24:10, 2 K 5:11, Dn 11:10, and with the
infinitive absolute strengthened by means of ??? Gn 31:15, 46:4, Nu 16:13); sometimes
to express the long continuance of an action; here again after an imperative, Is 6:9
???? ?? ???? ?? hear ye continually; after a perfect, Jer 6:29; after a participle, Jer 23:17;
after an imperfect consecutive, Gn 19:9, Nu 11:32.

1 1 In Arabic also, the intensifying infinitive regularly stands after the verb, but in
Syriac before the verb.

To this class belong especially those cases in which a second infinitive absolute is

co-ordinated with the first; the latter then expresses either an accompanying or
antithetical action or the aim to which the principal action is directed; e.g. 1 S 6:12
?????? ?????? ??????? lowing as they went (lowing continually; so after a participle, Jos 6:13b
Qerê); Gn 8:7 it went forth to and fro2; Is 19:22 smiting and (i.e. but also) healing
again; Jo 2:26 (see above, m).

Rem. 1. Instead of a second infinitive absolute (see above) there is sometimes found a

perfect consecutive (Jos. 6:13 a and 2 S 13:19 [but Stade’s ??????? is is preferable], in both
places as perfect frequentative; Is 31:5 referring to the future, unless with Stade, ZAW. vi.
189, we read ???????? and ??????????), or an imperfect consecutive (1 S 19:23, 2 S 16:13) or participle
(2 S 16:5); cf. also u.

2. The idea of long continuance is very frequently expressed by the verb ?????? to go, along
with its infinitive absolute, or even by the latter alone, and this occurs not only when it can be
taken in its literal sense (to go, to walk, as in the examples given above, Jos 6:9, 13, 1 S 6:12,
2 S 3:16, 13:19; cf. also, Is 3:16, where both infinitives stand before the verb, and Ps 126:6,
where ?????? precedes), but in cases where ?????? in the sense of to go on, to continue, merely
performs also the function of an adverb. The action itself is added in a second infinitive
absolute, or sometimes (see above, t) in a participle or verbal adjective. Examples, Gn 8:3
????? ??????
 and the waters returned … continually; Gn 8:5, 12:9, Ju 14:9, 2 K
2:11; with a participle following, Jer 4:16 (unless we read ??????, as in 2 S 3:16); with an
adjective following, Gen 26:13, Ju 4:24, 1 S 14:19, 2 S 5:10 (1 Ch 11:9), 2 S 18:25.1

 ???
???? ??
??????
?
?

 ...

On the other hand, in 1 S 17:41 the participle ?????? is used instead of the infinitive

absolute. Of a different kind are the instances in which the participle ?????? is used as predicate
along with the co-ordinate adjective (Ex 19:19, 1 S 2:26, 2 S 3:1, 15:12, Est 9:4, 2 Ch 17:12)
or participle (1 S 17:15, Jon 1:11, Pr 4:18, Ec 1:6).

3. The regular place of the negative is between the intensifying infinitive absolute and the
finite verb,2 e.g. Ex 5:23 ????????????? ??????? neither hast thou delivered at all, Ju 15:13, Jer 13:12,
30:11; cf. Mi 1:10 (??). Exceptions are Gn 3:4 (where the negation of the threat pronounced
in 2:17 is expressed in the same form of words); Am 9:8, Ps 49:8.

4. With a finite verb of one of the derived conjugations, not only the infinitive absolute of

the same conjugation may be connected (Gn 28:22 Pi(cid:31)?l; 17:13, Ex 22:3, Ez 14:3 Niph(cid:31)al;
Gn 40:15 Pu(cid:31)al; Ho 4:18 Hiph(cid:31)îl; Ez 16:4 Hoph(cid:31)al), but also (especially with Niph(cid:31)al,
rarely with Pi(cid:31)?l and Hiph(cid:31)îl; see Driver on 2 S 20:18) that of Qal as the simplest and most
general representative of the verbal idea, 2 S 20:18 (with Pi(cid:31)?l; but in Gn 37:33, 44:28 ?????
is a passive of Qal, § 52 e); 46:4 (with Hiph(cid:31)îl); Ex 19:13, 21:20, 2 S 23:7, Is 40:30, Jer 10:5,
Jb 6:2 (with Niph(cid:31)al); Is 24:19 (with Hithpo(cid:31)?l;
 in the same verse must also, according
to the Masora, certainly be the infinitive absolute Qal; see § 67 o), and so always ????? ??? he
shall surety be put to death. Elsewhere the infinitive absolute of a conjugation with kindred
meaning is found, Lv 19:20, 2 K 3:23 Hoph(cid:31)al for Niph(cid:31)al (but most probably we should

??????

2 2 Also in Ez 1:14 for the distorted form ???? reads simply ????? ???????.
ZAW. ZAW, = Zeitschrift für die alttestamentliche Wissenschaft, ed. by B. Stade,
Giessen, 1881 ff., and since 1907 by K. Marti.
1 1 Cf. in French, Le mal va toujours croissant, la maladie va toujours en augmentant
et en empirant, ‘continually increases and becomes worse and worse.’
2 2 Cf. Rieder, Quo loco ponantur negationes ??? et ?? … (Zeitschrift für
Gymn.Wesen, 1879, p. 395 ff.).

read, with Driver, the infin. Niph. in both places, ??????? and ????????); 1 S 2:16 (Pi(cid:31)?l for
Hiph(cid:31)îl, unless ????????? is to be read); Ez 16:4 (Hoph(cid:31)al for Pu(cid:31)al).3 Finally, the infinitive
absolute may equally well be represented by a substantive of kindred stem.1 In Is 29:14 the
substantive intensifying the verb is found along with the infinitive absolute.

5. Instead of the infinitive absolute immediately connected with the finite verb, an
infinitive construct form appears (cf. § 73 d), in Nu 23:25 (??? ???; cf. Ru 2:16 ??? ???); Jer
50:34 (?????? ????); Pr 23:1 (?????? ????). In the last instances the infinitive is probably assimilated to
the imperfect, like the infinitive Niph(cid:31)al in the forms noticed in § 51 k and note.—Cf. also 2
K 3:24
 (read so with the LXX) before ?, hence, no doubt due to the dislike of
a hiatus; so in Ps 50:21, Neh 1:7 (?????), all in rapid style; after the verb, Jos 7:7, unless ?????????
is intended.

??????? ??? ??

??????
?

4. Finally the infinitive absolute sometimes appears as a substitute for the finite
verb, either when it is sufficient simply to mention the verbal idea (see z), or when the
hurried or otherwise excited style intentionally contents itself with this infinitive, in
order to bring out the verbal idea in a clearer and more expressive manner (see aa).

???? ??

(a) The infinitive absolute as the continuation of a preceding finite verb. In the
later books especially it often happens that in a succession of several acts only the
first (or sometimes more) of the verbs is inflected, while the second (or third, &c.) is
added simply in the infinitive absolute. Thus after several perfects, Dn 9:5 (cf. verse
11) we have sinned … and have transgressed thy law, ????? and have turned aside
(prop. a turning aside took place); so after a perfect Ex 36:7 (?), 1 S 2:28, Is 37:19,
Jer 14:5, 19:13, Hag 1:6 (four infinitives), Zc 3:4 (but read with Wellhausen, after the
LXX,
), 7:5, Ec 8:9, 9:11, Est 3:13, 9:6, 16, 18, 12:6 ff., Neh 9:8, 13, 1 Ch
5:20, 2 Ch 28:19; 2 after the perfect consecutive, Zc 12:10; after the perfect
frequentative 1 K 9:25 (unless ?????????? be intended); after the simple imperfect, Lv
25:14, Nu 30:3, Jer 32:44 (three infinitives), 36:23, 1 Ch 21:24; after a cohortative,
Jos 9:20; after the imperfect consecutive, Gn 41:43 (as a continuation of ?????????); Ex
8:11, Ju 7:19, Jer 37:21, Neh 8:8, 1 Ch 16:36, 2 Ch 7:3; with ?? or after the jussive, Dt
14:21, Est 2:3, 6:9; after the imperative, Is 37:30b, Am 4:4f.; after the participle, Hb
2:15 (strengthened by ??, and regarded, like the participle itself, as an adverbial
accusative); Est 8:8.

????????

?

(b) At the beginning of the narrative, or at least of a new section of it. The special

form of the finite verb which the infinitive absolute represents must be determined

3 3 In three passages even the infinitive absolute of another stem of like sound occurs;
but in Is 28:28 ???? is no doubt a mere textual error for ???, and in Jer 8:13, according
to § 72 aa, we should read ????????, and in Zp 1:2 ?????. Barth, Nom.-bildung, § 49 b,
sees in ???? and ???? infinitives Hiph(cid:31)?(cid:31)l, exactly corresponding in form to aqâm[?]
the Aram. infin. Aph(cid:31)?l of ???; but there is no more evidence for a Hiph. of ??? in
Hebrew than for a stem ????.
1 1 On these substantives (and on the use of the infinitive absolute generally as
absolute object, see above, m), cf. the schema etymologicum treated in connexion with
the government of the verb in § 117 p, q.
2 2 In Ez 7:14 a perfect appears to be continued by means of an infinitive construct;
but the text is quite corrupt; Cornill reads

from the context. The infinitive absolute is most frequently used in this way,
corresponding to the infinitive of command in Greek, &c.1:—

(?) For an emphatic imperative,2 e.g. ??? ?? (thou shalt, ye shall), observe Dt 5:12;
????? (thou shalt) remember, Ex 13:3, 20:8 (the full form occurs in Dt 6:17 ????? ???? ??? ??;
7:18 ??????? ?????); Lv 2:6, Nu 4:2, 25:17, Dt 1:16, 2 K 5:10, Is 38:5, Jer 2:2, followed
by a perfect consecutive; Jos 1:13, 2 K 3:16, Is 7:4, 14:31 (parallel with an imperative;
in Na 2:2 three imperatives follow). But ?????? Ps 142:5 may be only an incorrect
spelling of ????? imperative.3

(?) For the jussive, Lv 6:7, Nu 6:5, 2 K 11:15, Ez 23:46; cf. also Pr 17:12 (let it

rather meet).

(?) For the cohortative, Is 22:13b  ? ???? ????
21:31, 23:30, 46; perhaps also Jer 31:2 (??????).4

?

 (the exclamation of the mocker); Ez

(?) For the imperfect in emphatic promises, e.g. 2 K 4:43 ye shall eat and leave
thereof; 19:29 (Is 37:30), 2 Ch 31:10; also in indignant questions, Jb 40:2 shall he that
cavilleth contend with the Almighty?5 (on the addition of the subject cf. the Rem.
below); Jer 3:1 and thinkest thou to return again to me? Jer 7:9 ff. (six infinitives,
continued by means of the perfect consecutive; cf. § 112 o).

(?) For any historical tense (like the Latin historic infinitive) in lively narration (or

enumeration) and description, even of what is still taking place in present time, e.g.
Hos 4:2 swearing and breaking faith, and killing, and stealing, and committing
adultery (in these they are busied); 10:4 (after a perfect); Is 21:5, 59:4, Jer 8:15,
14:19, Jb 15:35; cf. further Jer 32:33, Ec 4:2.—In Ez 23:30, Pr 12:7, 15:22, and 25:4,
the infinitive absolute is best rendered by the passive.

Rem. The subject is sometimes added to the infinitive absolute when it takes the place of
the finite verb, e.g. Lv 6:7, Nu 15:35, Dt 15:2, Ps 17:5, Pr 17:12, Jb 40:2, Ec 4:2, Est 9:1. So,
probably, also in Gn 17:10, Ex 12:48, although here ????????? according to § 121 a might also be
taken as an object with a passive verb; cf. Est 3:13. In 1 S 25:26, 33 the subject follows an
infinitive absolute which is co-ordinated with an infinitive construct, see above, e.

1 1 Cf. also such infinitives in French as voir (page so and so, &c.), s’adresser …, se
méfier des voleurs!
2 2 Praätorius, op. cit., p. 547: the extraordinarily common use of the infinitive form
q???l in the sense of an imperative, jussive, or cohortative has long since caused it to
be compared with the Arab. fa(cid:31)?li. It thus appears that the infin. q???l in Hebrew
could be used from early times as a kind of fixed, invariable word of command.
3 3 In Ez 21:31, for the infinitives construct ??????, ??????, ???? ???? (beside ????????) read with
Cornill the infinitives absolute ?????, &c. The Kethîbh probably intends ??????, &c.
4 4 In 2 S 3:18 the infinitive construct appears to be used instead of the cohortative,
but ??? ???? should certainly be read for ??? ????. Also in 1 K 22:30 (2 Ch 18:29), which
was formerly included under this head (I will disguise myself and go into the battle),
read ?????? ?????????.
5 5 In Jb 34:18 in a similar question instead of the infinitive constr. we should rather
expect the infinitive absolute (??????), unless with the LXX and Vulg. the participle
with the article (????????) is to be read.

§ 114. The Infinitive Construct.

1. The infinitive construct, like the infinitive absolute, may also represent a nomen
verbale (§ 45 a), but of a much more flexible character than the infinitive absolute (cf.
§ 113 a). Its close relation with nouns properly so called is especially seen in the
readiness with which the infinitive construct may be used for any case whatever; thus,

(a) As the nominative of the subject, e.g. Gn 2:18 ?????? ??????? ????? ???????, literally,
not good is the being of man in his separation; Gn 30:15, 1 S 23:20, Is 7:13, Pr 17:26,
25:7, 24 (but cf. 21:9
coming near unto thee, but the text is probably corrupt. With a feminine predicate, 1 S
18:23, Jer 2:17.

 in the same statement); Ps 32:9 prop. there is not a

???? ???

????

(b) As genitive, e.g. Ec 3:4 ????? ????? ????? ??? a time of mourning and a time of
dancing; Gn 2:17, 29:7, Neh 12:46, 2 Ch 24:14. This equally includes, according to §
101 a, all those cases in which the infinitive construct depends on a preposition (see
below, d) [and Driver, Tenses, § 206].

(c) As accusative of the object, e.g. 1 K 3:7

????? ???? ???

?? ???

 I know not the going

out or the coming in (I know not how to go out and come in); Gn 21:6, 31:28, Nu
20:21, Is 1:14, 37:28 (even with ???), Jer 6:15, Jb 15:22 (cf. for the use of the infinitive
absolute as object, § 113 f); as accusative with a verb expressing fullness, Is 11:9.

2. The construction of the infinitive with prepositions (as in Greek, ?? ?? ?????,

??? ?? ?????, &c.) may usually be resolved in English into the finite verb with a
conjunction, e.g. Nu 35:19 ??????????? in his meeting him, i.e. if (as soon as) he meets
him; Gn 27:45 (???????); Is 30:12
????????? ???  because ye despise; Jer 2:35 ???????????
???
because thou sayest; Gn 27:1 and his eyes were dim ??????? from seeing, i.e. so that he
could not see.

This use of the infinitive construct is especially frequent in connexion with ?? or ??
to express time-determinations (in English resolved into a temporal clause, as above
the combination of the infinitive with
especially after ??????? (see the examples, § 111 g), e.g. 1 S 2:27
they were in Egypt; Gn 24:30
 and it came to pass, when
 ???
???????? ??????? ???????
?
he saw (prop. in the seeing) the ring …, and when he heard (prop. in his hearing), &c.

??????  or ???? is resolved into a causal clause),

???????? ??????????

??? ???? ?????

 when

????

 ...

But by far the most frequent is the connexion of the infinitive construct with ??.1

Starting from the fundamental meaning of ??, i.e. direction towards something,
infinitives with ?? serve to express the most varied ideas of purpose or aim, and very
commonly also (with a weakening or a complete disregard of the original meaning of
the ??) to introduce the object of an action, or finally even (like the infinitive absolute

1 1 Cf. § 45 g, according to which the close union of the ?? with the first consonant of
the infinitive (??????? with a firmly closed syllable, as opposed to ???????, ???????, &c.)
seems to point to the formation of a special new verbal form. Quite distinct are the
few examples where the infinitive with ?? serves to express time, as Gn 24:63  ???????
??(cid:31)???
14:27, Ju 19:26; 2 S 18:29 when Joab sent the king’s servant.

 at the eventide (prop. at the time of the return of evening); cf. Dt 23:12, Ex

used adverbially, § 113 h, and the Latin gerund in -ndo) to state motives or attendant
circumstances. See the instances in the Remarks.

Rem. 1. The original meaning of the ?? is most plainly seen in those infinitives with ??
which expressly state a purpose (hence as the equivalent of a final clause), e.g. Gn 11:5 and
the Lord came down, ?????????? ??????? to see the city; also with a change of subject, e.g. 2 S
12:10 and thou hast taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite ???????? ???? ???????? to be (i.e. that she may
be) thy wife; cf. Gn 28:4, Jer 38:26 (?????).—If there is a special emphasis on the infinitive
with ??, it is placed, with its complement, before the governing verb, e.g. Gn 42:9, 47:4, Nu
22:20, Jos 2:3, 1 S 16:2 with ???; Ju 15:10, 1 S 17:25 with ?????.

2. Just as clearly the idea of aiming at a definite purpose or turning towards an object may

be seen in the combination of the verb ????? to be, with ?? and an infinitive. In fact ???????? ?????
may mean, either (a) he was in the act of, he was about to (as it were, he set himself), he was
ready, to do something, or (b) he or it was appointed or compelled, &c., to do the action in
question. In the latter case ???????? ????? corresponds to the Latin faciendum erat, cf. also the
English I am to go. In both cases ????? (as elsewhere when copula) is often omitted.

Examples of (a) Gn 15:12

????? ???

????? ???????
?

 and when the sun was going down (just about

to set); 2 Ch 26:5 ???????? ?????? ??????? and he set himself to seek God (here with the secondary
idea of a continuous action); with the omission of ????? Is 38:20,
to save me; 1 S 14:21 (?), Jer 51:49, Ps 25:14 (et foedus suum manifestaturus est eis); Pr
18:24 (?), 19:8 (??????? consecuturus est, unless we simply read ??????? with the LXX)1; 20:25, Ec
3:15 ???????? ? ???? quod futurum est; 2 Ch 11:22, 12:12 (in a negative statement); in a question,
Est 7:8 (will he even … ?). Cf. also 1 S 4:19.

 the Lord is ready

??? ??????? ???????

????

Of (b) Jos 2:5

??????? ???
????? ???????
?

 and the gate was to be shut (had to be shut); Is 37:26, Ps

109:13.2 Mostly with the omission of ?????, e.g. 2 K 4:13 ??? ???? ???????? ??? what is to be done for
thee? (???????????? ?????) wouldest thou be (lit. is it to be) spoken for to the king, &c.? 2 K 13:19
??????? it was to smite equivalent to thou shouldest have smitten; Is 5:4, Ps 32:9, 68:19 (?), Jb
30:6 (habitandum est iis), 1 Ch 9:25, 10:13, 22:5, 2 Ch 8:13 (?), 11:22, 19:2, 36:19 (?), Ho
9:13, Hb 1:17. In a question 2 Ch 19:2; after ??? 1 Ch 5:1, 15:2; after ???? 1 Ch 23:26, 2 Ch
5:11 and frequently.

Of the same kind also are the cases, in which the infinitive with ?? depends on the idea of

an obligation or permission (or prohibition); especially in such forms of expression as 2 S
18:11

 it was upon me, i.e. it would have been my duty to give thee, &c.3; cf. Mi

??? ???? ???

?? ?????
?

1 1 P. Haupt (SBOT., Proverbs, p. 52, lines 10 ff.; Critical Notes on Esther, p. 170, on
7:8) considers it possible that here and in Pr 2:8, 6:24, 7:5, 16:30, 30:14, as well as in
14:35, 17:21 before a noun, the ? is a survival of the emphatic ? with an imperf.,
which is especially common in Arabic. In that case ??????? must be read ???????, i.e.
?##???????. But all the above instances can be taken as infinitives with ? without
difficulty.
2 2 Somewhat different are the cases where ?? ????? with the infinitive (which is then
used exactly as a substantive) implies to become something, i.e. to meet with a
particular fate, as Nu 24:22 (cf. Is 5:5, 6:13) ??????? for wasting, for which elsewhere
frequently ??? ???? and the like; probably also ??????? Ps 49:15 is to be explained in this
way, the ????? being omitted.
3 3 2 S 4:10 (cui dandum erat mihi) appears to be similar; it may, however, be better,
with Wellhausen, to omit the ? ????.

3:1 (2 Ch 13:5) it is not for you to (i.e. are ye not bound to)?4 with a negative, 2 Ch 26:18  ???
??? ???? it pertaineth not unto thee, Uzziah, to burn incense unto the Lord, but only to the priests;
also ?? ???? with an infinitive expresses it is not permitted (nefas est), may not, e.g. Est 4:2  ???? ???
????? for none might enter; 8:8, 1 Ch 15:2; 5 ?? ???? with an infinitive is used in a somewhat
different sense, equivalent to it is not feasible, not possible, e.g. in Ps 40:6, Ec 3:14, 2 Ch
5:11.6—With either meaning ??? can be used instead of ????, e.g. Am 6:10 ?????????? ??? nefas est,
to make mention of the name of the Lord: but Ju 1:19 for it was not possible to drive out, &c.,
perhaps, however, the text originally stood as in Jos 17:12 ???? ??????? ???; 1 Ch 15:2.

3. A further class comprises the very numerous cases, in which the infinitive with ?? is
used as the object1 of a governing verb, hence, again, for the direction which an action takes.
The verbs (or conjugations) which occur most frequently in this combination with ?? and an
infinitive are: ????? (with an infinitive without ??, e.g. Dt 2:25, 31, Jos 3:7), ?????? to begin, ??????,
????? (prop. to add) to continue, very frequently, even in prose, with an infinitive without ??, as
Gn 4:12, 8:10, 12, 37:5, 1 S 3:8, Jb 27:1, &c.; ????? to cease from, to desist; ????? to complete, to
make an end of; ????? to be finished; ???????? to come near to, Gn 12:11; ????? to hasten (with an
infinitive without ?? Ex 2:18); ???? to be willing (with an infinitive without ?? Is 28:12, 30:9, Jb
39:9); ????? to will, to desire; ????? to refuse (to be unwilling); ????? to seek; ????? to be able (with
an infinitive without ??, e.g. Gn 24:50, 37:4, Ex 2:3, 18:23, Nu 22:38, Jb 4:2); ????? with an
accusative of the person in the sense of to give up to some one, to cause, or permit him to do
something, e.g. Gn 20:6, Ps 16:11 (with an infinitive abs. Jb 9:18, see § 113 d), ????? to
understand how to do something (in Jb 3:8 ????? ??????????? is analogous); ????? to learn; ????? to
wait, expect (with a change of subject, e.g. Is 5:2 and he waited for it to bring forth grapes).

We must further mention here a number of verbs in Hiph(cid:31)îl (partly denominatives),
which express an action in some definite direction (cf. § 53 f), as ???????? to do greatly, ???? ???? to
make (it) low, ????????? to make (it) high, ????????? to make (it) deep, ???????? to make (it) far, distant,
??????? to make (it) good (with an infinitive without ?? Ps 33:3, but 1 S 16:17, in the same
combination, with ??); ???? ???? to do anything early (Ps 127:2, along with its opposite ????? to do
something late, with an infinitive without ??); ??????? to make (it) much, ??????? to make (it)
wonderful (even with a passive infinitive 2 Ch 26:15),2 &c.

????(cid:31)??

(cid:31)? ??????

??????? ???

 and there is not

 and our part shall be the infinitive without ?? stands as

4 4 But in 1 S 23:20 after
the subject of the sentence.
5 5 Quite different of course are such cases as Is 37:3
strength to bring forth; cf. Nu 20:5, Ru 4:4.
6 6 In 2 S 14:19 ??? (= ??? it is, there is) is used in a similar sense after ???, the negative
particle of asseveration, of a truth it is not possible to turn to the right hand or to the
left.
1 1 This view is based upon the fact, that in numerous expressions of this kind (see the
examples above) the ?? may be omitted, and the infinitive consequently stand as an
actual accusative of the object (see above, c). However, the connexion of the verb
with the object is in the latter case closer and more emphatic (hence especially
adapted to poetic or prophetic diction), than the looser addition of the infinitive with
??; thus ???? ?? ??? ??? Is 28:12 is equivalent to they desired not obeying (??? ??? also
with the infin. abs. in Is 42:24; cf. § 113 d); but ???? ???? ??? ??? Ez 20:8 rather expresses
they could not make up their mind as to hearkening. When connected with ??, the
governing verb has a more independent sense than when it directly governs the
accusative of the object.
2 2 In almost all these examples the principal idea is properly contained in the
infinitive, whilst the governing verb strictly speaking contains only a subordinate

4. Finally, the infinitive with ?? is very frequently used in a much looser connexion to state

motives, attendant circumstances, or otherwise to define more exactly. In English, such
infinitive constructions (like the Latin gerund in -do; cf. f) must frequently be turned by that
or a gerund; e.g. 1 S 12:17 ?????? ????? ??? ???? in asking you a king; 14:33, 19:5, 20:36, Gn 3:22,
18:19, 34:7, 15, Ex 23:2, Lv 5:4, 22, 26, 8:15, Nu 14:36, 2 S 3:10, 1 K 2:3 f., 14:8, Jer 44:7 f.,
Ps 63:3, 78:18, 101:8, 103:20, 104:14 f., 111:6, Pr 2:8, 8:34, 18:5, Neh 13:18. Sometimes the
infinitive with ?? is used in this way simply by itself, e.g. 1 Ch 12:8 as the roes upon the
mountains ??????? (as regards hasting) in swiftness; Gn 2:3, 2 S 14:25 (???????); Is 21:1 (????????); Jo
2:26, Pr 2:2, 26:2 and so very frequently the infinitive ?????? dicendo which has become
stereotyped as an adverb to introduce direct narration (in the sense of thus, as follows).1

5. In a number of instances—especially in the later books—the infin. constr. with ??
appears to be attached by W?w (like the infinitive absolute, § 113 z), as the continuation of a
previous finite verb. In most examples of this kind it is, however, evident that the infinitive
with ?? virtually depends on an idea of intention, effort, or being in the act of, which,
according to the sense, is contained in what has preceded, whilst the copula, as sometimes
also elsewhere, is used in an emphatic sense (and that too); thus e.g. Ex 32:29 (if the text be
right) fill your hand to-day (sc. with an offering) for the Lord … and that to bring a blessing
upon you, i.e. that ye may be blessed; cf. 1 S 25:31 (otherwise in verses 26 and 33 where the
infinitive absolute is used, see § 113 e); Ps 104:21, 2 Jb 34:8, Ec 9:1, Neh 8:13, 2 Ch 7:17.—
In Lv 10:10 f. ??????????? might be regarded as an explanatory addition to the command contained
in verse 9 b (= this prohibition of wine before the service shall ye observe, and that in order to
put a difference, &c.); but probably the text has been disturbed by a redacfor.—In 2 Ch 30:9
??????? depends on the idea of receiving favour which lies in ???????????. On the other hand, in 1 S
8:12 it is sufficient to explain and in order to appoint them unto him for captains of thousands
(sc. he will take them). In Is 44:28 translate and he (Cyrus) shall perform all my pleasure, and
that in saying of Jerusalem, &c.

3. The period of time to which an action or occurrence represented by the

infinitive construct belongs, must sometimes be inferred from the context, or from the
character of the principal tenses; cf. e.g. Gn 2:4 these are the generations of the
heaven and of the earth, ??????????? when they were created (prop. in their being
created); Ju 6:18
(= when she should have been given); 2 K 2:1, Ho 7:1.

 until I come unto thee, and bring forth, &c. Cf. 1 S 18:19

??????

??? ???

adverbial statement, and is therefore best rendered in English by an adverb; e.g. Gn
27:20 how is it that thou hast found it so quickly? (prop. how thou hast hastened to
find!), Gn 31:27 wherefore didst thou flee secretly? So frequently with ??????? (= often,
abundantly), Ex 36:5, 1 S 1:12, 2 K 21:6, Is 55:7, Am 4:4, Ps 78:38, &c.; with ??? (=
again), Dt 30:9, 1 K 13:17, Ho 11:9, Ezr 9:14; cf. also 2 S 19:4, Jer 1:12, Jn 4:2, and
the analogous instances in § 120 g; also 2 K 2:1 thou hast asked a hard thing.
1 1 ?????? is very often so used after ????????? in the Priestly document (Gn 8:15, 17:3, &c.,
and numberless times in the legal parts of Exod., Lev., and Num.)—a pleonasm which
is not surprising considering the admittedly prolix and formal style of the document.
2 2 When Delitzsch on Ps 104:21, referring to Hb 1:17, explains the infinitive with ??
as an elliptical mode of expressing the coniugatio periphrastica (equivalent to
flagitaturi sunt a deo cibum suum), this is, in point of fact, certainly applicable to this
and a few other places mentioned above; but all these passages, in which the infinitive
with ??? follows, are to be distinguished from the cases treated above under h, where
the infinitive with ?? without W?w corresponds to a Latin gerundive, or is actually used
to express the coniugatio periphrastica.

Rem. 1. The constructions of the infinitive with a preposition, described above under d,

are almost always continued in the further course of the narrative by means of the finite verb,
i.e. by an independent sentence, not by a co-ordinate infinitive. Such a finite verb we regard
as governed by a conjunction, which corresponds to the preposition standing before the
infinitive. Thus the infinitival construction (frequently even with a change of subject) is
continued by a perfect (with ???), Jer 9:12 because they have forsaken (???????????) my law …
????? ?? ????? and have not obeyed my voice; Gn 39:10, 1 S 24:12, Am 1:9; without ??? Jb 28:25
(perf. after ?? and infin.); by a perfect with ?? (cf. § 112 i and § v) Am 1:11 ??? ?????????? because
he did pursue his brother with the sword, ??? ???? and did cast off continually all pity (a
frequentative perfect; for examples of the perfect consecutive proper see Gn 27:45, Ju 6:18, 1
S 10:8, 2 K 18:32 [Is 36:17], always after ????????? until I come); by a simple imperfect, e.g. Pr
1:27 (after ??); Is 30:26 (after ????? in the day, a temporal phrase which has here become
equivalent to a preposition); Is 5:24 (after ??  ), 10:2, 13:9, 14:25, 45:1, 49:5, 1 S 2:8, Pr 2:8,
5:2, 8:21 (always after ??)1; by an imperfect consecutive, e.g. Gn 39:18 and it came to pass,
?????????? ????? ??????????? as I lifted up my voice and cried, that …; 1 K 10:9, Jb 38:13 (after ??); 1 K
18:18, Is 38:9, Jb 38:7, 9 ff. (after ??); Is 30:12, Jer 7:13, Ez 34:8 (after

?????? ).

2. The negation of an infinitive construct, on account of the predominance of the noun-
element in its character, is effected not by the verbal negative ???(except in the compound
?????, which has come to be used as a preposition, without, Nu 35:23, Pr 19:2), but by ???????,
originally a substantive (see the Lexicon), with ?? prefixed (but also Nu 14:16 ?????????), e.g. Gn
3:11
 not to eat of it; in a final sense, 4:15 lest any finding him should smite
him; only in 2 K 23:10 is ?? repeated before the infinitive. In Ps 32:9 (if the text be right) ???
negatives, not the infinitive, but the predicate which is understood.

?? ?????????

§ 115. Construction of the Infinitive Construct with Subject and Object.

1. Like the infinitive absolute (see § 113 a), the character of the infinitive

construct as a verbal noun is shown by its power of taking the case proper to its verb,
and hence in transitive verbs2 the accusative of the object, e.g. Nu 9:15  ?????? ?????
??? ?????????? on the day the tabernacle was reared up; 1 S 19:1 ????????? ???????? that they
should slay David; Gn 14:17, 19:29, Ex 38:27, 1 K 12:15, 15:4; with a negative, e.g.
Lv 26:15 ???????????????? ????? ????????? so that ye will not do all my commandments; with the
 that he may establish
accusative of the personal pronoun, e.g. Dt 29:12
 to kill me; Jer 38:26
thee; Gn 25:26, Jer 24:7; with a verbal suffix, e.g. Ex 2:14
????
 that he would not cause me to return (on the suffix, cf. c). In Is 49:6 the
object even precedes the infinitive with ??; on this order cf. the note on § 114 r.—If the
verb governs a double accusative, the infinitive may also take the same, e.g. Gn 41:39
???????????? ???????
21:16.

 forasmuch as God hath showed thee all this; Dt

?????????????? ???
????

???????? ???
?
?

?????
????????

??? ???? ?????????

???? ???????

1 1 The great frequency of examples of this kind, especially in the poetical books, is
due to a striving after what is called chiasmus in the arrangement of the parallel
members in the two halves of the verse, i.e. in the instances given, the finite verb at
the end of the second (co-ordinate) clause is parallel with the infinitive at the
beginning of the first. In this way the verbal form necessarily became separated from
the ??, and consequently the imperfect had to be used instead of the perfect
consecutive. Such a parallelism of the external and internal members of a verse is
frequent also in other cases, and was evidently felt to be an elegance of elevated—
poetic or prophetic—style.
2 2 For examples of the accus. of the object with a pass. infin., see § 121 c.

Rem. 1. The object after the infinitive construct must also always be regarded as in the
accusative, even when it is not expressly introduced (as inall the above examples) by the nota
accusativi ????, and when therefore the substantive in question might easily be taken as the
genitive of the object governed by the infinitive (the usual construction in Arabic), e.g. Pr
21:15 ??? ???? ????? to do judgement. Against regarding it as a genitive, which is in itself possible
(the doing, the executing of judgement), is the fact (a) that elsewhere the nota accusativi is so
frequently added; (b) that in such a case the secondary forms of the infinitive, such as ????? for
(
) ????? Gn 48:11 (cf. Ps 101:3, Pr 16:16), would be unintelligible; (c) that certain
????????
infinitive forms, if they were to be regarded as in the construct state, could hardly retain the
pretonic Qame? without exception, whereas, when connected with suffixes (i.e. with real
genitives; cf. § 33 c), this Qame? necessarily becomes Šewâ; e.g. Gn 18:25 ?????? ???????? to slay
the righteous (never as ?????????; cf., on the other hand, above,
Similarly in such cases as Is 3:13 (Ps 50:4) instead of ?????? ?????? we should rather expect ??????, if
the infinitive were regarded as in the construct state, and ?????? as the genitive. Hence also in
cases like Is 58:9 (??? ?? for ???? ??) we must assume, with Sellin, op. cit., p. 78, a merely
‘external phonetic connexion’ and not the genitive construction.

2. The verbal suffixes added to the infinitive are (with the exception of

 to know me, Jer 24:7) or in the form of a noun-suffix (as genitive of the object). The

 is doubtless a verbal not a noun-suffix, although in form it might be
 Nu 16:13, Ju 13:23 (after ?????). Elsewhere the pronominal object is appended

 Jer 39:14)
only the suffix of the 1st pers. sing. (besides the above examples cf. also 1 S 5:10, 27:1, 28:9,

misunderstanding; e.g. 1 S 20:33 ???????? (prop. for his smiting) to smite him, not, as the form
might also mean, in order that he might smite; cf. 1 K 20:35; with the suffix of the 3rd sing.
fem. Nu 22:25; of the 3rd plur. Jos 10:20, 2 S 21:2, &c. Hence also the suffixes of the 2nd
sing. with the infinitive, as ??????????? Jer 40:14, cf. Mi 6:13, and even ???????? to magnify thee, Jos
3:7, must certainly be regarded as nominal not verbal suffixes. The connexion of the noun-
suffix, as genitive of the object, with the infinitive, was so fully established, that it could be
used not only in such strange cases, as Gn 37:4 ??? ???? ?????? ??????? ??? they could not speak to
him peaceably, cf. Zc 3:1 ???? ???? to be an adversary to him, but ultimately even in the 1st sing.,
as in Nu 22:13 ??????? to give me leave [Dt 25:7 ??????? ???? ??? he will not perform the duty of a
husband’s brother unto me; 1 Ch 4:10 ??????? ????????? that it may not grieve me!]

 prop. in the bearing them;

?????

3. The power of governing like a verb is also retained in those verbal nouns which,
although originally secondary forms of the infinitive, have fully acquired the value of nouns,
e.g. Is 11:9 ??????????? ????? (prop. to know the Lord) the knowledge of the Lord; ????? ???????? to fear
me, Dt 4:10, 5:26, 10:12; an accusative follows ????????? Dt 10:12, 15, Is 56:6 (cf. also 1 K 10:9,
Ho 3:1); ?????????? Is 30:28;
 Dt 1:27; after verbal nouns formed with the prefix
?   (cf. § 45 e), Nu 10:2, Is 13:19, Am 4:11, Ez 17:9. The accusative of the object likewise
remains after infinitives (or their secondary forms) which have the article, e.g. Gn 2:9, Jer
22:16, or a suffix, e.g. Gn 5:4, &c., 28:4, 6, 29:19 f., 30:15, 38:5, 2 S 3:11, Is 29:13.

???? ??????? ???? ????

2. The subject of the action represented by the infinitive is mostly placed
immediately1 after it, either in the genitive or nominative. The subject is in the

1 1 In Gn 24:30 the subject of ??????? is wanting (but ???? ???? follows); the original
reading was undoubtedly ????????, and the text is now in a state of confusion; verse 30a
should come before verse 29b. In Gn 19:29, 25:26, Ex 9:16, 13:21, 1 S 18:19, Jer

genitive (§ 33 c) whenever it has the form of a noun-suffix, and also when the
infinitive has the termination of the constr. st. fem. sing. (see f); probably also in
many other cases, where the infinitive in form and meaning is used more like a
substantive, and accordingly governs like a noun. On the other hand, the subject of the
infinitive is certainly to be regarded as a nominative, when it is separated from the
infinitive by any insertion, and according to certain indications (see g) very probably
in ninny other instances.

Rem. 1. Examples of genitives of the subject after infinitives in the connective form are
 prop. in the Lord’s hating us; cf. 7:8, Gn 19:16, 1 K 10:9, Is 13:19,

Dt 1:27
47:9, Ho 3:1, Am 4:11. The subject of the infinitive is probably also to be regarded as
genitive in such cases as Ex 17:1 and there was no water ????? ??? ???? for the people to drink
(prop. for the drinking of the people), and in cases like Gn 16:16 (
19:1, Nu 20:3, 4, 33:38, 1 K 6:1, Ps 133:1, 2 Ch 7:3, &c.

); Gn 16:3, Ex

workers of iniquity may hide themselves there (prop. for the hiding themselves there the
workers of iniquity); cf. Gn 34:15, Nu 35:6, Dt 19:3, Ju 9:2, 2 S 24:13, Ps 76:10, and below, i.
The subject is likewise to be regarded as a nominative, whenever the Lamedh is prefixed to
the infinitive by means of a pretonic Qame? (cf. b above), e.g. 2 S 19:20
,
since, if the infinitive were used as a nomen regens, we should rather expect ????? according
to § 102 f. That the subject of the infinitive is regarded elsewhere also as nominative is again
(see above, b) probable, since in such forms as ??????? Dt 25:19, Is 14:3, ?????? Ps 46:3, &c., the
pretonic Qame? is retained without exception, whereas on the analogy of  ???????
Jer 23:20, &c., we should expect ???????, ??????, &c., if the infinitive were regarded as a nomen
regens. Or was the retention of the Qame? (assuming the thorough correctness of the
Masoretic punctuation) rendered possible even before a following genitive, because that
vowel was characteristic of the form? It is at all events certain that owing to the lack of case-
endings,1 a distinction between the genitival and nominatival constructions could not have
been consciously made in the case of most infinitives, e.g. in unchangeable forms like ?????,
???, &c.

 Ez 24:13, ???????

???? ?????

3. When both a subject and an object are connected with the infinitive, the rule is,

that the subject should immediately follow the infinitive, and then the object. The
latter, in such a case, is necessarily in the accusative, but the subject (as in e) may be
either in the genitive or in the nominative. The noun-suffixes again are, of course, to
be regarded as genitives, e.g. Gn 39:18 ????? ??????????? as I lifted up my voice (cf. 1 K
13:21, and the examples, Gn 5:4, &c., enumerated above, under d), and so also
substantives which follow a connective form, Dt 1:27, &c.; see above, d and f.

On the other hand, the subject appears necessarily to be in the nominative in such
 as if a rod should shake them that lift it up (for

????????????? ???

cases as Is 10:15

?? ????????
?

41:6, Ps 42:4 the subject, although not indicated, is easily supplied from the context.
The infinitive in such cases is best rendered in English by a passive.
1 1 In Arabic, where the case-endings leave no doubt as to the construction, it is
equally possible to say either qatlu Zaidin (gen. of subj.) (cid:31)Amran (acc.), literally
Zaid’s killing (cid:31)Amr, or qatlu (cid:31)Amrin (gen. of obj.) Zaidun (nom. of subj.), or even
el-qatlu (with article) Zaidun (nom. of subj.) (cid:31)Amran (acc. of obj.).

the plur. ?????? cf. § 124 k), not ?????????, as would be expected (see g above), if
were in the genitive; cf. 2 S 14:13, Jb 33:17. And so probably also in other cases, as
Gn 5:1, 13:10, Jos 14:7, 1 K 13:4, 2 K 23:10, Is 32:7. The subject is separated from
the infinitive by an insertion (and consequently must necessarily be in the nominative;
see g above), e.g. in Jer 21:1.

??????

Rem. Less frequently the object is placed immediately after the infinitive, and then the
nominative of the subject, as a subsequent complement, e.g. Is 20:1 ???????? ???? ???? ???? when
Sargon sent him; Gn 4:15, Jos 14:11, 2 S 18:29, Is 5:24, Ps 56:1, Pr 25:8. In Nu 24:23 the
subject follows an infinitive which has a noun-suffix in place of the object.

Cf. Sellin (see above at the head of § 113), p. 6 ff., and Kahan, p. 11 ff.

§ 116. The Participles.

1. Like the two infinitives, the participles also occupy a middle place between the

noun and the verb. In form they are simple nouns, and most nearly related to the
adjective; consequently they cannot in themselves be employed to represent definite
relations of tense or mood. On the other hand, their verbal character is shown by their
not representing, like the adjectives, a fixed and permanent quality (or state), but one
which is in some way connected with an action or activity. The participle active
indicates a person or thing conceived as being in the continual uninterrupted exercise
of an activity. The participle passive, on the other hand, indicates the person or thing
in a state which has been brought about by external actions.

Rem. That the language was fully conscious of the difference between a state implying

action (or effected by external action) and mere passivity, is seen from the fact, that
participles proper cannot be formed from the purely stative Qal, but only verbal adjectives of
the form q???l (?????, ?????, &c.) or q???l (??????, &c.), whereas the transitive Qal ??? ?? to hate,
although it coincides in form with the intransitive Qal (as a verb middle e), nevertheless forms
a participle active ????, and participle passive ??? ?? (cf. the feminine ???? ??).—In cases where
the participle proper and the verbal adjective both occur, they are by no means synonymous.
When the Assyrians are called in Is 28:11 ??? ?? ???????? men of stammering lips, a character is
ascribed to them which is inseparably connected with their personality. On the other hand
??? ????? ????? Jer 20:7, describes those about the prophet as continually engaged in casting
ridicule upon him. Cf. also Ps 9:18 (????? ??) with 50:22 (????????).

On the difference between the participle as expressing simple duration and the imperfect

as expressing progressive duration, cf. what has been stated above in § 107 d. Nevertheless
the participle is sometimes used—especially in the later books, cf. e.g. Neh 6:17, 2 Ch
17:11—where we should expect the action to be divided up into its several parts, and
consequently should expect the finite verb. But the substitution of the participle for the
tempus historicum, which becomes customary in Aramaic (cf. Kautzsch, Gramm. des Bibl.-
Aram., § 76. 2, d, and e), is nevertheless quite foreign to Hebrew.

2. The period of time indicated by (a) a participle active, either as an attribute or

predicate, must be inferred from the particular context. Thus ??? may mean either
moriens (Zc 11:9), or mortuus (so commonly; with the article ????? regularly = the
dead man), or moriturus (Dt 4:22);  ???  coming, come Gn 18:11, &c., venturus 1 S
2:31, &c.;
ruin, Is 30:13, Am 9:11). For other examples of perfect participles see Gn 27:33,
43:18 (?????? that was returned; cf. Ezr 6:21, &c., ????????? which were come again from

?????  falling, but also fallen, Ju 3:25, 1 S 5:3, and ready to fall (threatening

the captivity); Gn 35:3, Ex 11:5, Zc 12:1, Ps 137:7, Pr 8:9, Jb 12:4 (?????), and see m
below. For future participles see Gn 41:25, 1 K 18:9, Is 5:5, Jon 1:3, &c., probably
also ???????? Gn 19:14. On the futurum instans (esp. after ?????) see p below.

(b) Of the passive participles, that of Qal (e.g. ????? scriptus) always corresponds

to a Latin or Greek perfect participle passive, those of the other conjugations,
especially Niph(cid:31)al, sometimes to a Latin gerundive (or to an adjective in -bilis), e.g.
????? metuendus, to be feared, Ps 76:8, &c.; ??????? desiderandus (desiderabilis) Gn 3:6,
Ps 19:11, &c.; ??????? creandus Ps 102:19; ?????, usually natus, but also (like ??????? Ju
13:8) procreandus, nasciturus 1 K 13:2, Ps. 22:32; ???????? terribilis Ps 89:8; ???????
abominable Jb 15:16; ? ?????? aestimandus Is 2:22;

animal) Lv 11:47. In Pu(cid:31)al ??????? laudandus, worthy to be praised Ps 18:4. In
???? ?? ; 2 K 11:2 ???????????; Is 12:5 Qerê
Hoph(cid:31)al, 2 S 20:21

?????????

????

??

????????

3. The participles active, in virtue of their partly verbal character, possess the
power of governing like verbs, and consequently, when used in the absolute state,
may take after them an object either in the accusative, or with the preposition with
which the verb in question is elsewhere usually construed, e.g. 1 S 18:29 ????????? ?????
hating David; Gn 42:29; with the suffix of the accusative, e.g.
 that made me Jb
31:15;
 that girdeth me
them Ps 68:28, sometimes also with the article, e.g. Ps 18:33
(LXX ? ???????? µ?); Dt 8:14–16, 13:6, 11, 20:1, 2 S 1:24, Is 9:12 (where, however,
Cheyne omits the article), 63:11, Ps 81:11, 103:4, Dn 11:6; followed by a preposition,
e.g. 1 K 9:23 ????? ????????? which bare rule over the people; 2 K 20:5 ???? ????? ????????
behold, I will heat thee.2

 who seeth us? Is 29:15 (in Is 47:10  ???????

 is abnormal); ????? ruling

??????????

???? ???

???????

???

????

By an exhaustive examination of the statistics, Sellin (see the title at the head of § 113), p.

40 ff., shows that the participle when construed as a verb expresses a single and
comparatively transitory act, or relates to particular cases, historical facts, and the like, while
the participle construed as a noun (see g) indicates repeated, enduring, or commonly
occurring acts, occupations, and thoughts.

So also the verbal adjectives of the form q???l may take an accusative of the
person or thing, if the finite verb from which they are derived governs an accusative,
e.g. Dt 34:9 ??????? ???? ????? full of the spirit of wisdom; Ps 5:5
pleasure in wickedness.

 that hath

?? ?????

?? ??

As a sort of noun the participle may, however, also exercise the same government
as a noun, being in the construct state, and followed by the object of the action in the
genitive (see § 89 a; and cf. § 128 x), e.g. Ps 5:12
 that love thy name; cf. Ps
19:8 f.; also when a verbal adjective, e.g. Gn 22:12 and often ???????? ????? one fearing

?? ?? ????????

???

1 1 Such examples as ?????, ???????, ??????? show plainly the origin of this gerundive use of
the participle passive. A person or thing feared, desired, or praised at all times is
shown thereby to be terrible, desirable, or praiseworthy, and therefore also to be
feared, &c.
2 2 On the other hand, in Is. 11:9 as the waters ???????? ????? covering the sea, the ? serves
only to introduce the object preceding the participle [cf. the Arabic parallels cited by
Driver, Tenses, § 135, 7 Obs.]. Cf. Hab. 2:14.

God; Hb 2:15; with an infinitive, Ps 127:2; with a noun-suffix (which, according to §
33 c, also represents a genitive), e.g. Gn 4:14 ???????????? whosoever findeth me (prop.
my finder; cf. ?? ??? my maker); 12:3
 that bless thee, ?????????? that curseth thee
?????????
????
????????
(but read either
18:49. In Jer 33:22 read ????? ??????? ????.1

, or ?????????? in the preceding clause); 27:29, 1 S 2:30, Is 63:13, Ps

????

Rem. To the class of objective genitives belong also specifications of place after the

???

 egrediens, since the verbs ??? and ?????, in the sense of ingredi,

 that went
?????  Gn 9:10, 34:24, 46:26, &c.—In poetic language the

participles ??? iniens and  ?????
egredi, can be directly connected with an accusative; e.g. Gn 23:10, 18
in at the gate of his city; La 1:4; after
participle in the construct state may be connected not only with a genitive of the object, but
also with any other specifications (especially of space) which otherwise can only be made to
depend on the verb in question by means of a preposition; cf. Is 38:18, and frequently,
???????????? they that go down into the pit (the grave); Ps 88:6
32:24 (Mi 7:17); 1 K 2:7, 2 K 11:5, 7, 9 those that came in (or went out) on the sabbath, Pr
2:7, 1 Ch 5:18, &c.; instead of the construction with ????, e.g. Is 59:20 (those who turn from
transgression), Mi 2:8 (cf. § 72 p).

 that lie in the grave; Dt

 her converts; Ps 53:6 (??????); Pr 2:19

These genitives of nearer definition appear also in the form of a noun-suffix, e.g. Ps
18:40, 49 ????? (for ????? ??????) that rise up against me; cf. Ex 15:7, Dt 33:11, Ps 44:6, Ex 32:25,
Is 1:27
construction is especially bold in Is 29:7
stronghold (for
); Ps 102:9 even with a participle Po(cid:31)al, ?????????? they that

 in the accusative, or whether it is to be regarded as

4. The passive participles also may either be in the absolute state, and take the
determining word in the accusative,2 or may be connected with it in the construct
state, e.g. Ju 18:11, 1 S 2:18, Ez 9:2 ?????? ????? clothed in linen, cf. verse 3 ???????? ???????;
(even with a suffix ???????? ?????? rent as regards his coat 2 S 15:32; with the participle
following Ju 1:7); but Ez 9:11 ???????? ????? the one clothed with linen; 2 S 13:31  ???????

1 1 When, as in Jb 40:19, the participle with the noun-suffix ??????? he that made him,
also has the article (cf. § 127 i), the anomaly is difficult to understand, since a word
determined by a genitive does not admit of being determined by the article.—No less
remarkable is the use of the constr. st. of the participle before the accusative in Jer
33:22 ????? ?????? ???? that minister unto me (for which there is ?????? ???? in verse 21). In Am
4:13 an accusative of the product follows the genitive of the object, ?????? ??? ?? ?? ???
maker of the morning into darkness. In Jer 2:17 ????????? ????? is supposed to mean at the
time when he led thee; perhaps the perfect (????) should be read as in 6:15. In Ez
27:34, the ancient versions read ?????? ???? (?)???? now thou art broken, instead of the
difficult
2 2 On the proper force of this accusative when retained in the passive construction cf.
below, § 117 cc, &c., and § 121 c, d. So also Neh 4:12 is to be understood, and the
builders were ???????????? ???????? ?????? ???? girded every one with his sword on his side,
and building.

. In 1 K 20:40 read ?? ??? before

.
??(cid:31)???? ???(cid:31)???

?? ???? ???

(cid:31)???

???????? rent in respect of clothes, equivalent to with their clothes rent (cf. Jer 41:5); Nu
24:4, Dt 25:10, Is 3:3, 33:24, Jo 1:8, Ps 32:1 (
transgression, ?????? ????? covered in respect of sin); with a suffix to the noun, Pr 14:2
???????? ????? he that is perverse in his ways.

 forgiven in respect of

????????

?? ??

Rem. The passive participle occurs in the construct state before a genitive of the cause,

e.g. in Is 1:7 ??? ????? ?? burnt with fire; cf. Gn 41:6, Ex 28:11, Dt 32:24; before a genitive
denoting the author, e.g. Gn 24:31 ??????? ?????? blessed of the Lord (but Ps 115:15 ???????? ????????,
see § 121 f); cf. Is 53:4, Ps 22:7, Jb 14:1 (1514, 25:4); hence also with noun-suffixes (which
are accordingly genitive) Pr 9:18
37:22.

 her invited ones, i.e. those invited by her; cf. 7:26, Ps

??????

????

5. The use of the participle as predicate is very frequent in noun-clauses (which,

according to § 140 e, describe established facts and states), in which the period of
time intended by the description must again (see above, d) be inferred from the
context. Thus:

(a) As present, in speaking of truths which hold good at all times, e.g. Ec 1:4  ????? ?????? ???

??? one generation goeth, and another generation cometh; and the earth abideth (
ever; cf. verse 7; also to represent incidental (continuous) occurrences which are just
happening, Gn 3:5, 16:8 (I am fleeing); 32:12, Ex 9:17, 1 S 16:15, 23:1, 2 K 7:9, Is 1:7; when
the subject is introduced by the emphatic demonstrative ????? behold! (§ 100 o and § 105 b),
e.g. Gn 16:11 ????? ?????? behold, thou art with child, &c.; 27:42; frequently also in circumstantial
clauses (connected by W?w), cf. § 141 e, e.g. Gn 15:2, &c.

????????

) for

(b) To represent past actions or states, sometimes in independent noun-clauses, e.g. Ex

???????????

??????????? ??????

 and all the people saw the thunderings, &c.; 1 K 1:5; in

20:18
negative statements, e.g. Gn 3923 a; sometimes in relativeclauses, e.g. Gn 3923 b, Dt 3:2 (cf.
also the frequent combination of the participle with the article as the equivalent of a relative
clause, e.g. Gn 32:10 ???????? which saidst; 12:7, 16:13, 35:1, 3, 36:35, 48:16, 2 S 15:31, &c.);
sometimes again (see n) in circumstantial clauses, especially those representing actions or
states which occurred simultaneously with other past actions, &c., e.g. Gn 19:1 and the two
angels came to Sodom ? ??? ????? and (i.e. while) Lot sat, &c.; 18:1, 8, 16, 22, 25:26, Ju 13:9, 2
Ch 22:9; also with the subject introduced by ????? 37:7, 41:17. (On ?????? with a following
adjective or participle to express an action constantly or occasionally recurring, cf. § 113 u.)

(c) To announce future actions or events, e.g. 1 K 2:2, 2 K 4:16 at this season when the

?

??? ???

???? ???

 thou shalt embrace a son; so after a specification of time, Gn
time cometh round,
7:4, 15:14, 17:19, 19:13, Hag 2:6 (but in Is 23:15, where, after ??????? we should rather expect a
perfect consecutive, it is better to explain
?? ??????
perfect; on the form, cf. § 44 f); or in relative clauses, Gn 41:25, Is 5:5 what I am doing, i.e.
am in the act of doing; in a deliberative question, Gn 37:30; but especially often when the
subject is introduced by ????? (especially also if the subject be attached as a suffix to ????? as ???????,
?????? , &c.), if it is intended to announce the event as imminent, or at least near at hand (and sure
to happen), when it is called futurum instans, e.g. Gn 6:17, 15:3, 20:3, 24:13 f., 48:21, 50:5,
Ex 3:13, 8:25, 9:3, 34:10, Jos 2:18, Ju 7:17, 9:33, 1 S 3:11, 2 K 7:2, Is 3:1, 7:14, 17:1, Jer
30:10, Zc 2:13, 3:8; with a participle passive, 2 S 20:21: cf. also § 112 t.

, with Qim?i, as the 3rd sing. fem. of the

????

Rem. 1. As the above examples show, a noun-clause with a participle as predicate may
have for its subject either a substantive or a personal pronoun; in both cases the participle,
especially if there be a certain emphasis upon it, may precede the subject. Also in noun-
clauses introduced by ????? the subject may be either a substantive, or (e.g. Gn 37:7) a separate

personal pronoun, or a suffix attached to ?????. In the same way, the subject may also be
introduced by ??? (est, see the Lexicon) with a suffix, and in negative sentences by ???? (non est)
with a suffix, e.g. Ju 6:36 ??? ???? ?? ???????? if thou wilt save; Gn 43:5
 if thou wilt not
send; 1 S 19:11.—In such cases as Is 14:27 ????????? ???? the stretched out hand is his, ????????? is
not, like ??????? in 9:11, 16, &c., the predicate (in which case the participle could not take the
article), but the subject; cf. Gn 2:11, 45:12, Is 66:9, Ez 20:29, Zc 7:6 (cf. § 126 k), where the
participle with the article likewise refers to the present, also Nu 7:2, Dt 3:21, 4:3, &c., 1 S
4:16, where it refers to the past. In 1 K 12:8 and 21:11 even in relative clauses after ? ????.

???? ????????????

????

2. To give express emphasis to an action continuing in the past, the perfect ????? in the
corresponding person is sometimes added to the participle, and similarly the imperfect ????????
(or the jussive ?????, or the imperfect consecutive) is used to emphasize an action continuing in
the future, e.g. Jb 1:14 ???????? ???? ??????? the oxen (cows) were plowing; Gn 37:2, 39:22, Ex 3:1,
Dt 9:24, Ju 1:7, 1 S 2:11, 2 S 3:6; the same occurs with a passive participle, e.g. Jos 5:5, Zc
3:3; ???????? with a participle is found e.g. in Is 2:2; the jussive in Gn 1:6, Ps 109:12; 1 and ????
with a participle in Ju 16:21, Neh 1:4.

3. The personal pronoun which would be expected as the subject of a participial clause is
frequently omitted, or at least (as elsewhere in noun-clauses, cf. Is 26:3, Ps 16:8, Jb 9:32) the
pronoun of the 3rd pers. ???, e.g. Gn 24:30, 37:15, 38:24, 41:1, 1 S 10:11, 15:12, Is 29:8 (the
participle always after ?????); cf., moreover, Gn 32:7, Dt 33:3, 1 S 17:25, 20:1, Is 33:5, 40:19,
Ps 22:29, 33:5, 55:20, Jb 12:17, 19 ff., 25:2, 26:7.—???? is omitted in Lv 18:28;
32:12, Ez 8:12, Neh 9:3; in a relative clause, Gn 39:22, Is 24:2.—The personal pronoun of the
2nd pers. masc. (????) is omitted in Hb 2:10; the 2nd fem. (???) in Gn 20:16 (where, however,
for the participle
 is to be read); the pronoun of the 1st sing. in

Hb 1:5 (?), Zc 9:12, Mal 2:16; the 2nd plur. (????) 1 S 2:24 (if the text be right), 6:3, Ez 13:7

Of a different kind are the cases in which some undefined subject is to be supplied with
the participle; e.g. Is 21:11 ????? ????? there is one calling unto me (= one calleth; § 144 d); cf. Is
30:24, 33:4.—So with participles in the plur., e.g. Ex 5:16 (????????? sc. the taskmasters); Jer
38:23 (in 33:5 the text is corrupt), Ez 13:7 (?), 36:13, 37:11 (equivalent to sunt qui dicant).

4. We must mention as a special class those noun-clauses which occur at the beginning of
a period, and are intended to lay stress upon the fact that the first action still continues on the
occurrence of the second (always introduced by ??); e.g. Jb 1:16 f. ??? ????? ??????? ??? ??? he was yet
speaking, and (=when) another came, &c.1; cf. Gn 29:9, 1 S 9:11, 27, 20:36, 1 K 14:17 she
was entering the threshold of the house, when the child died; 2 K 2:23, 4:5, Dn 9:20 f.; also in
Ju 19:22, 1 S 9:14, 17:23, 1 K 1:42, Jb 1:18 f., in all which passages the apodosis is
introduced by ???????.—On the other hand, in 1 K 1:14 the noun-clause itself is introduced by
????? (as in verse 22 by ???????), and denotes an action only just impending.2 Finally, when the

1 1 A jussive is practically to be supplied also in the formulae of blessing and cursing,
?????? blessed be … Gn 9:26, &c.; ???? cursed art thou … 3:14, &c.
1 1 The independent noun-clause here lays stress upon the simultaneous occurrence
(and consequently the overlapping) of the events far more forcibly than could be done
by a subordinate expression of time (as e.g. ???????? ???????). In English it may be
represented by scarcely had he finished speaking when. … As the above examples
show, the apodosis also frequently consists of a noun-clause.
2 2 At the same time the preceding ??? still shows that what is announced is not
merely a future event, but a future event contemporaneous with something else; the
case thus entirely differs from the examples given in § 112 t, where ????? refers to the

???????
whole sentence is introduced by means of ??????? (cf. § 111 g), and the apodosis by
42:35, 2 K 2:11, 13:21; without ????? in the apodosis, 1 S 7:10, 2 K 19:37 (Is 37:38).

, Gn

Participles active, which are used in the sense of the perfect participle, and also

participles passive, in accordance with their meaning, express in such noun-clauses a state
still continuing on the occurrence of the principal action, e.g. Gn 38:25 ?????? ?? ?????? ?????? ????
she was being brought forth, when she sent, &c.; cf. Gn 50:24. [See further in Driver, Tenses,
§§ 166–169.]

5. Different from the examples treated in u and v are the instances in which a participle
(either alone or as the attribute of a noun) stands at the beginning of the sentence as a casus
pendens (or as the subject of a compound noun-clause, see § 143 c) to indicate a condition,
the contingent occurrence of which involves a further consequence; e.g. Gn 9:6  ??????? ??? ??????
????????? ???? ??????? shedding man’s blood, i.e. if any one sheddeth man’s blood, by man shall his
blood be shed; Ex 21:12, Ps 75:4, Pr 17:14, Jb 41:18; so especially if ???? every precedes the
participle, Gn 4:15, 1 S 3:11 (2 K 21:12), 2 S 5:8 (whosoever smiteth), 1 Ch 11:6. The
apodosis is very often introduced by ?? (w?w apodosis), e.g. Ex 12:15 (with a following perfect
consecutive), Nu 35:30; 1 S 2:13
?? ?????? ???????? ???????
?
sacrifice, the priest’s servant came, &c.; 2 S 14:10 (participle with article); 22:41 (where,
however, the text is to be emended in accordance with Ps 18:41); 2 S 23:3 f., Pr 23:24 Keth.;
29:9.—As in the instances discussed under u, such sentences are sometimes preceded by ???????,
cf. 1 S 10:11, 11:11, 2 S 2:23 ????????? ??????? and it came to pass, that as many as came, &c. [or
by ???????, frequentative, Ju 19:30].—On the other hand,
 Dn 8:22 is a mere catchword
(equivalent to and as for that which was broken) to call to mind the contents of verse 8.

6. On the use of the participle after the infinitive absolute ?????? cf. § 113 u.

7. Almost as a rule the participial construction beginning a sentence (like the infinitival
constructions according to § 114 r) is continued by means of a finite verb with or without ??,
before which the English construction requires us to supply the relative pronoun implied in
the participle; thus, continued by means of a perfect, Is 14:17
made the world as a wilderness, and overthrew the cities thereof1; 43:7, Ez 22:3, Ps 136:13
ff., Pr 2:17; by a perfect without W?w, Gn 49:11; by a simple imperfect (as the modus rei
repetitae in the present), Is 5:23, 46:6, Pr 7:8, Jb 12:17, 19 ff., 24:21; by an imperfect without
W?w, e.g. 1 S 2:8, Is 5:8, Pr 2:14, 19:26; by an imperfect consecutive, Gn 27:33, 35:3, 1 S
2:6, Jer 13:10 (after several participles), Ps 18:33, 136:10f.

therefore generally placed; see the examples.
1 1 On the parallelism between the external and internal members, which appears here
and in many other examples of this kind, see the note on § 114 r.

1. The simplest way in which a noun is subordinated to a verbal form is by the
addition of an accusative of the object to a transitive verb.2 In the absence of case-
endings,3 this accusative can now be recognized only from the context, or by the
particle ???? (???, before suffixes also ???, ???)4 prefixed to it. The use of this nota
accusativi is, however, somewhat rare in poetry, and even in prose it is not invariably
necessary but is restricted to those cases in which the accusative of the object is more
closely determined by being a proper name, or by having the article, or by a following
determinate genitive (hence also by the suffixes), or in some other way (see below, c),
e.g. Gn 4:1 and she bare
heaven and the earth (but 2:4

Rem. 1. The rare occurrence of the nota accusativi in poetic style (e.g. it never occurs in

Ex 15:2–18, Dt 32, Ju 5, 1 S 2, &c., though it is frequent in the late Psalms) may be explained
from the fact that in this as in other respects (cf. § 2 q) poetry represents a somewhat more
archaic stage of the language than prose. The need of some external means of indicating the
accusative could only have been felt after the case-endings had become wholly extinct. Even
then the ?? would probably have been used at first to indicate only an object placed before the
verb (when it followed, it was already sufficiently characterized by its position as depending

2 2 The verb in question may either have been originally transitive, or only have
become transitive by a modification of its original meaning. Thus the vocalization
shows that ????? (to have pleasure, usually with ??) to desire, ????? (to be full of
something, also transitive) to fill, were originally intransitive. Cf. also such cases as
????? to weep (generally with ????, ???? or ??), but also to bewail with an accusative; ? ???? to
dwell (usually with ??), but also to inhabit with an accusative (cf. further, under u).—
The examples are different in which verbs of motion such as ??? intrare, also aggredi,
?????? egredi (cf. § 116 h above), ??? redire, Is 52:8, take an accusative of the aim of the
motion, while ??? according to the Old Semitic usage, even takes an accusative of the
person (at least in poetry, equivalent to ???? ??? in prose).
3 3 On traces of these endings, especially the remains of a former accusative ending in
a, cf. § 90 c.
4 4 ???? (toneless owing to the following Maqqeph), and ??? (with a tone-long ?, ?????
only in Jb 41:26), ??? or ??? before the light suffixes (on all these forms cf. § 103 b:
the underlying form ?th was obscured in Hebrew to ôth, shortened to ?th before
suffixes beginning with a consonant and then modified to ????, whence finally the
secondary form ??? with the tone), Phoenician ??? i.e. probably iyy?th (for the
Phoenician form, cf. G. Hoffmann, Einige phönik. Inschriften, Göttingen, 1889, p. 39
f.), Punic yth or (according to Euting) pronounced even as a mere prefixed t, Arabic,
before suffixes, ’iyyâ, Aram. ???, ???. It was no doubt originally a substantive, meaning
essence, substance, self (like the Syriac y?th; on the other hand, any connexion with
the Hebrew ???, Syriac ’?i?, Arabic ’?yat, a sign, must, with Nöldeke, ZDMG. xl.
738, be rejected), but now united in the construct state with a following noun or suffix
stands for the pronoun ipse, ?????. In common use, however (cf. Wilson, ‘The
particle ?? in Hebrew,’ Hebraica, vi. 2, 3, and the precise statistics of the use of ?? on
p. 140 ff.), it has so little force (like the oblique cases ?????, ????, ?????, sometimes
also ipsius, ipsum, and the Germ. desselben, &c.) that it merely serves to introduce a
 prop. ????? ??? ??????? (cf. ????? ????????, Iliad
determinate object;
 ??? ???????. Cf., further, P. Haupt on
i. 143) is no stronger than the simple

on the verb), or proper names.1 Finally, however, the nota accusativi became so customary
everywhere in prose, that even the pronominal object was expressed rather by ?? with
suffixes than by verbal suffixes, even when none of the reasons mentioned under e can be
assigned for it; cf. Giesebrecht in ZAW. 1881, p. 258 ff., and the statistics of H. Petri, cited
above at the head of § 58. Such examples as ???????? ???? ????? ? ???? ????? Gn 6:22 in the Priestly
Code, beside

 7:5 in the Jahvist, are especially instructive.

2. As accusatives determined in other ways, we have in the first place to consider the
collectives introduced by ??? entirety, without a following article or determinate genitive,
inasmuch as the meaning of ??? includes a determinative sense, cf. e.g. Gn 1:21, 30, 8:21, Dt
2:34, 2 K 25:9. ??????? is used absolutely in Gn 9:3, cf. 39:23; similarly, ??? is determinate of
itself, since it always denotes a person, hence ??????? quem? e.g. Is 6:8, 37:23, &c., but never
??????? quid? So also the relative ? ???? in the sense of eum qui or quem, &c., e.g. 1 S 16:3, or id
quod, Gn 9:24, &c. Cf. also such examples as Jos 2:10, 1 S 24:19, where ? ???? ??? is equivalent
to the circumstance, that, &c.—Elsewhere ??? stands before nouns which are determinate in
sense, although the article is omitted, which according to § 126 h is very frequently the case
in poetic or otherwise elevated style; thus Lv 26:5, Jos 24:14, 15, Is 41:7 (to distinguish the
object from the subject); 50:4 (with the first of two accusatives, also for the sake of
clearness); Ez 13:20, 43:10, Pr 13:21 (where the ????????? are to be regarded as a distinct class);
Jb 13:25 (unless, with Beer and others, we read  ?????  for ??????); also Ec 7:7 may be a quotation
of an ancient maxim.

On the other hand ??? occurs very seldom in prose before a noun actually or apparently

undetermined. In 1 S 24:6 ????? is more closely defined by means of the following relative
clause; in 2 S 4:11 ?????? ???? refers to Ishbosheth (as if it were him, who was an innocent man);
in 1 K 6:16 ???? ???? ???? refers to the particular twenty cubits. In Ex 21:28 (otherwise in verse
29) perhaps the ???? is used in order to avoid the combination ???? ??? (as in Nu 21:9 to avoid
the cacophony ???? ??????? ?? ?????); in Lv 7:8 and 20:10 the accusatives are at any rate defined by
the centext.—In Nu 16:15 ????? ???????? probably means even a single one (and then ipso facto a
definite one) of them, as also in 1 S 9:3 ????????????? ???????? may refer to some definite one of the
men-servants. In Gn 21:30 we should read
 with the Samaritan, since the seven
???????? ???
lambs have been already mentioned; in Ex 2:1 translate with Meyer, Die Israeliten, p. 79,
????????????? the daughter of Levi; in Ex 28:9 read
?????????? is probably a scribal error due to ???????????; in 1 S 26:20 read ? ?????? with the LXX for
????? ??????; in 2 S 5:24 read
from 20:3, where it refers to the women already mentioned; in 2 S 18:18 read
both ???? and ? ???? with the LXX and Lucian; in 1 K 12:31 omit ????; in 2 K 23:20 probably
????????????? is to be read; in 2 K 25:9 the text is corrupt. In Ez 16:32 ?????????? might refer to the
strangers in question; but see Smend on the passage.

3. The pronominal object must be represented by ?? with a suffix (instead of a verbal

suffix), when (a) it precedes the verb, e.g. Nu 22:33
 I had slain thee
and saved her alive; Gn 7:1, Lv 22:28, 1 S 8:7, Is 43:22, 57:11, Jer 4:17, 22, 7:19; (b) when a
suffix is already attached to the verb, and as a rule when a second accusative with ?? follows,
e.g. 2 S 15:25
children; Nu 16:32, 1 S 5:11, 2 S 14:16 (but cf. also Dt 11:6, 15:16, &c., and Driver on 1 S
5:10); (c) after an infinitive absolute, see above § 113 a note; (d) after an infinitive construct,

 and he will show me it; Ex 17:3 ??????????? ????? ???????? to kill us and our

??????? ??????? ?????
???? ????????
?
?

???? ???
???????
?

????

1 1 Thus, in Dt 33, ?? occurs only in verse 9 (twice, with an object preceding the
verb), in Gn 49 in the blessing of Jacob only in verse 15 with a co-ordinate second
object (consequently farther removed from the verb). Of the thirteen instances of ?? in
the Mêša? inscription, seven stand directly and four indirectly before proper names.

when it is immediately followed by the subject, e.g. Gn 41:39, or when the combination of a
suffix with the infinitive might lead to a misunderstanding, e.g. Gn 4:15 ??????????? ????????? lest
one should smite him, &c., where ?????? ????????? might also mean lest he should smite.

4. The pronominal object is very frequently omitted, when it can be easily supplied from
the context; so especially the neuter accusative referring to something previously mentioned
(the English it) after verba sentiendi (??? ??) and dicendi, e.g. Gn 9:22, &c., ??????? and he told (it);
also after ????? to give, Gn 18:7, 24:41, &c., ????? to take, ?????? to bring, ?? ?? to lay, Gn 9:23, &c.,
????? to find, Gn 31:33, &c. A personal object is omitted, e.g. in Gn 12:19, 24:51 (after ?????.—
The omission of the plural object is remarkable, because it leaves an opportunity for a
misunderstanding, in Gn 37:17
?? ???
should read ???????? ?? with the Samaritan.

1 I heard them saying; perhaps, however, we

????????? ????

5. In common formulae the substantival object is also sometimes omitted (an elliptical

expression); thus e.g. ????? 1 S 20:16, &c. (see the Lexicon) stands for
to close (sc. a bargain) with any one; ????? to keep (sc. ?? anger) equivalent to to be resentful,
Ps 103:9, &c.; so also ??? ?? Jer 3:5 (beside ?????); ? ???? for ??? ? ???? to lift up the voice, Is 3:7; ?? ? ????
for
 to take away any one’s sin (to forgive), Gn 18:24, 26, Is 2:9; ??? ?? to put forth (sc.
??? the hand) equivalent to to reach after something, 2 S 6:6, Ps 18:17.

 like the English

???? ? ????

?? ?????

????

??

6. Verba sentiendi may take a second object, generally in the form of a participle or

?????? ????

adjective and necessarily indeterminate, to define more exactly the action or state in which the
object is perceived, e.g. Nu 11:10 ????? ????????? ? ??? ??? ?????? and Moses heard the people
 thee have I seen righteous. Frequently, however, the second
weeping; Gn 7:1
object is expressed by a separate clause. This is especially frequent with ???? to see, e.g. Gn
1:4 and God saw the light, that it was good; Gn 6:2, 12:14, 13:10, 49:15, Ex 2:2, Ps 25:19, Pr
23:31, Jb 22:12, Ec 2:24, 8:17; so with ????? to know, Ex 32:22, 2 S 3:25, 17:8 (with two
objects); 1 K 5:17.

???? ??????
?

7. In certain instances ?? serves apparently to introduce or to emphasize a nominative.

This cannot be regarded as a reappearance of the original substantival meaning of the ??,
since all unquestionable examples of the kind belong to the later Books of the Old Testament.
They are rather (apart from textual errors or other explanations) cases of virtual dependence
on an implied verbum regens understood. The constant use of ?? to indicate a clause governed
by the verb, necessarily led at length to the use of ?? generally as a defining particle
irrespective of a governing verb. So in the Hebrew of the Mishna1 (see above, § 3 a) ???? and
????? are prefixed even to a nominative without any special emphasis.

Naturally the above does not apply to any of the places in which ?? is not the nota
accusativi, but a preposition (on ?? with, cf. § 103 b), e.g. Is 57:15, 1 S 17:34 (??????????? and
that, with a bear; ???? here, however, has probably been interpolated from verse 36, where it is
wanting); nor the places in which the accusative is subordinate to a passive (according to §
121 c) or to a verb of wanting as in Jos 22:17 and Neh 9:32, see below, z. In Ez 43:17 ??????
about governs like a verb, being followed by ?????.

Other cases are clearly due to attraction to a following relative pronoun in the accusative

(Ez 14:22, Zc 8:17; but Hag 2:5a, to ??????, must be omitted, with the LXX, as a later
addition), or the accusative depends on a verbal idea, virtually contained in what has gone
before, and consequently present to the speaker’s mind as governing the accusative. Thus Nu

1 1 According to the ordinary rules of syntax (cf. § 116 t) we should translate, I heard
men who said, &c.
1 1 Cf. Weiss, ????? ???? ???? (Vienna, 1867), p. 112.

3:26 (the verbal idea contained in ?????? verse 25 is they had to take charge of); in Jos 17:11
?? ???? implies it was given up or they gave him; 1 S 26:16 see where is equivalent to search
now for; in 2 S 11:25 ?????? ?????? is used in the sense of noli aegre ferre2; Jer 36:33 and he
had the brazier before him; in Ec 4:3 a verb like I esteem is mentally supplied before ? ???? ???.
On Jos 22:17, Neh 9:32, see below, aa.—Aposiopesis occurs in Dt 11:2 for not your children
 is to be supplied.
(do I mean); still more boldly in Zc 7:7, where either ??????? ?? or

???? ????

???????

 (

)

Setting aside a few undoubtedly corrupt passages3 there still remain the following
examples, in which ???? in the later Hebrew manner (almost in the sense of the Latin quod
attinet ad) introduces a noun with more or less emphasis, Nu 3:46, 5:10, 35:6, Ju 20:44, 46,
Ez 17:21, 20:16, 35:10, 44:3, Neh 9:19, 34, Dn 9:13, 2 Ch 31:17.—In Ez 47:17–19 (cf. also
43:7) it is simplest to emend ???? for ????, according to verse 20. However, even the LXX,
who have ????? only in verse 18, can hardly have known any other reading than ??;
consequently in all these passages ?? must be regarded as virtually dependent on some
governing word, such as ecce (LXX 43:7 ??????), and 47:17 ff. as equivalent to thou shalt
have as a border, &c.

?????  Ps 145:14 (but cf. 146:8), ????? Nu 25:18,

8. Another solecism of the later period is finally the introduction of the object by the
preposition ?? (prop. in relation to, in the direction of), as sometimes in Ethiopic1 and very
commonly in Aramaic.2. Less remarkable is this looser connexion of the object with a
participle, as with ???? La 4:5, ????? Nu 10:25,
???? ???? and ??? ?? Jb 12:23; before the participle Is 11:9.—To introduce an object preceding the
finite verb ?? is employed in Jb 5:2 (cf. also Dn 11:38); also after ???? Lv 19:18, 34; ?????????? Ps
129:3; ???????? Ezr 8:24, 2 Ch 25:10; ?????? Jb 9:11; ?????? 1 Ch 29:20 (immediately before with an
accusative); ??????? 1 Ch 5:26; ????? Ezr 6:21, 1 Ch 22:19, 2 Ch 17:13; ???????? Gn 45:7, where,
however, read ???????? with the LXX for ?????? and take  ?????  as a dativus commodi; ????? 1 Ch
16:36, 2 Ch 5:13; ????? 2 S 3:30, Ps 135:11 (verse 10 with accusative), 136:19 f.; ????? (to bind
up) Is 61:1 (Ez 34:4 before the verb); ????? Ps 69:6; ????? Ps 86:9; ????? Jer 40:2, 2 Ch 23:1; ?????????
and ? ???? 1 Ch 29:22; ????? 2 Ch 28:15; ?????? Ps 145:14; ????? 1 Ch 16:37; ???????? Ez 26:3; ????? Ps
116:16; ????? Jb 19:28; ???????? Is 53:11; ??? ?? 2 Ch 24:12 (previously accusatives); ?? ?? 1 S 22:7
(but probably ????????? is to be read); ?? ???? (in the connexion, ?? ????? ?? ????) 2 Ch 10:6 (but verse 9
and 1 K 12:9 with an accusative); ??? ?? Nu 32:15, 1 S 23:10; ?? ?? Ps 73:18; ??? ?? Ezr 8:16, 2 Ch
2:12, 17:7; ??? ?? 1 Ch 29:18, 2 Ch 5:11.

9. Sometimes the verb, on which an accusative of the object really depends, is contained

only in sense in the verb which apparently governs, e.g. Is 14:17 ???????? ????????? ????????? his
prisoners he let not loose nor sent them back to their home. On this constructio praegnans in
general, see § 119 ff.

2 2 So also in 1 S 20:13 the Qal (??????) is, with Wellhausen, to be read instead of the
Hiph??(cid:31)l.
3 3 Thus 1 S 26:16, where ????? is to be read for ?????; 1 K 11:25, where at present the
predicate of the relative clause is wanting; in 2 K 6:5 the ?? is probably derived from
a text which read the Hiph??(cid:31)l instead of ?????. In Jer 23:33 instead of the artificial
explanation what a burden (is, do ye ask?) we should read with the LXX and Vulg.
???????? ???? ye are the burden. In Ez 10:22 ??????? ?????????? is unintelligible; in 37:19 read
with Hitzig ???? for ??; in Hag 2:17 for ???? read with the LXX ?????? ?? [or ????????; for
the ??? cf. 2 K 6:11, Jer 15:1, Ez 36:9].
1 1 Dillmann, Grammatik der äthiopischen Sprache, p. 349.
2 2 With regard to Biblical Aramaic, see Kautzsch’s Grammatik des Bibl.-Aram., p.
151 f. In other ways, also, a tendency may be observed in later Hebrew to make use of
the looser connexion by means of prepositions instead of the closer subordination of
the noun in the accusative.

2. With the proper accusatives of the object may also be classed what is called the
internal or absolute object (also named schema etymologicum or figura etymologica),
i.e. the addition of an object in the form of a noun derived from the same stem,1 e.g.
 they feared a fear (i.e. they were in great fear), Pr 15:27; also with
??
Ps 14:5
the object preceding, e.g. La 1:8 ???? ?????? ??????? ????? Jerusalem hath sinned a sin; with a
double accusative (see below, cc), e.g. 1 K 1:12, ????? ??? ?????????? let me, I pray thee, give
thee counsel; 1 K 1:12.2

?? ?????

????

Rem. (a) Strictly speaking the only cases of this kind are those in which the verbal idea is

supplemented by means of an indeterminate substantive (see the examples above). Such a
substantive, except in the case of the addition of the internal object to denominative verbs (see
below), is, like the infinitive absolute, never altogether without force, but rather serves like it
to strengthen the verbal idea. This strengthening is implied in the indeterminateness of the
internal object, analogous to such exclamations as, this was a man!3 Hence it is intelligible
that some intensifying attribute is very frequently (as in Greek usually) added to the internal
object, e.g. Gn 27:34
bitter cry; cf. the Greek ?????? ????? ?????, ???????? ????? µ?????? (Matt. 2:10); magnam
pugnare pugnam, tutiorem vitam vivere, &c.

 he cried (with) an exceeding great and

????? ??????? ??????? ?????????

????????? ?

Examples of an internal object after the verb, and without further addition, are Ex 22:5, 2

S 12:16, Is 24:22, 35:2, 42:17, Ez 25:15), 26:15, 27:35, Mic 4:9, Zc 1:2, Pr 21:26; with an
intensifying attribute, Gn 27:33, Ex 32:31, Ju 15:8, 2 S 13:36, 1 K 1:40 (cf. Jon 4:6, 1 Ch
29:9); Is 21:7, 45:17, Jon 1:10, Zc 1:14, 8:2a, Dn 11:3; along with an object proper the
internal object occurs with an attribute in Gn 12:17, 2 S 13:15; cf. also Is 14:6, Jon 4:1.—An
internal object without an attribute before the verb: Is 24:16, Jer 46:5, Hb 3:9, Jb 27:12; with
an attribute before the verb: Jer 14:17, Zc 1:15 (cf. also Gn 30:8, Jer 22:19, 30:14, Ps 139:22).
Instead of the substantive which would naturally be expected, another of kindred meaning is
used in Zc 8:2.

(b) Only in a wider sense can the schema etymologicum be made to include cases in
which the denominative verb is used in connexion with the noun from which it is derived, e.g.
Gn 1:11, 9:14, 11:3, 37:7, Ez 18:2, Ps 144:6, probably also Mi 2:4, or where this substantive,
made determinate in some way, follows its verb, e.g. Gn 30:37, Nu 25:11, 2 K 4:13, 13:14, Is
45:17, La 3:58, 4 and, determinate at least in sense, Jer 22:16; or precedes it, as in 2 K 2:16, Is
8:12, 62:5, Zc 3:7; cf. also Ex 3:9. In both cases the substantive is used, without any special
emphasis, merely for clearness or as a more convenient way of connecting the verb with other
members of the sentence.

3. Verbs which denote speaking (crying out, weeping), or any external act,
frequently take a direct accusative of the organ or means by which the action is
performed. In this case, however, the accusative must be more closely determined by
an attributive adjective or a noun in the genitive. This fact shows the close relation

3 3 The Arab grammarians assign to the indeterminate eases generally an intensive
sense in many instances; hence the commentators on the Qorân usually explain such
cases by adding and what …! see §125 b.

between these accusatives and the internal objects treated under p, which also,
according to q, mostly take an intensifying attribute. On the other hand, they must not
be regarded as adverbial (instrumental) accusatives, nor are they to be classed with the
second (neuter) subjects treated below in § 144 l.

Examples of the accusative following the verb are ?????????? ?????????? and I cried a
loud voice, i.e. with a loud voice, Ez 11:13, 2 S 15:23 (after the proper object, Dt
5:19, 1 K 8:55); Ps 109:2 they have spoken unto me
with a lying tongue; Pr 10:4 he becometh poor ??????????? ?? ??? dealing a slack hand, i.e.
who dealeth with a slack hand; cf. the German eine schöne Stimme singen, to sing a
fine voice, eine tüchtige Klinge schlagen, to smite a trusty sword, Schlittschuhe
laufen, to run skates (i.e. to skate), and our to write a good hand, to play ball, &c.—
Examples of the accusative preceding are ??????????? ??????? ?????? ?? my mouth shall praise
with joyful lips, Ps 63:6; cf. Ps 12:3, where a casus instrumenti with ?? follows the
accusative.

 a tongue of deceit, i.e.

?? ?????

????

4. Many verbs originally intransitive (sometimes even in form; see a, note 2 may
be used also as transitives, in consequence of a certain modification of their original
meaning, which has gradually become established by usage; cf. e.g. ???? to strive, but
also with an accusative causam alicuius agere (so even in Is 1:17, &c.; elsewhere
with ?? of the person for whom one strives); ????? absolutely to be able, with an
accusative to prevail over any one; ????? to be inclined and ????? to have pleasure
(usually with ??), with an accusative to wish for some one or something; ??? ?? cubare,
then in the sense of concumbere, originally joined with ???? cum, but quite early also
with the accusative, equivalent to comprimere (feminam), &c. So in 2 S 13:14, &c.,
unless in all or some of the passages the preposition ??? is intended, e.g. ????? for ?????;
in the earlier passages ???? is the more usual.

Rem. 1. It is certainly difficult to decide whether some verbs, which were afterwards used

absolutely or joined with prepositions, were not nevertheless originally transitive, and
consequently it is only the supposed original meaning, usually assigned to them in English,
which causes them to appear intransitive.1 In that case there is of course no syntactical
peculiarity to be considered, and a list of such verbs would at the most be requisite only for
practical purposes. Moreover, it is also possible that certain verbs were originally in use at the
same time both as transitive and intransitive, e.g. perhaps ????? to be clothed along with ????? to
put on (a garment). Finally the analogy of certain transitives in constant use may have led to
intransitives of kindred meaning being also united directly with the accusative, so that, in
other words, whole classes of verbs came to be regarded in a particular aspect as transitives.
See below, y.

2. The modification of the original meaning becomes especially evident when even
reflexive conjugations (Niph?al, Hithpa??l, &c.) take an accusative (cf. § 57, note 2); e.g. ?????
to prophesy, Jer 25:13; ????? (prop. to put oneself round) to surround, Ju 19:22; ??????? to fight, Ps
109:3 (where, however, the Qal
 should be read; cf. Ps 35:1); also ????????? to shave
(something) for oneself, Num 6:19; ????????? to take some one for oneself as a possession, Is

?????????
?

????

1 1 Thus e.g. ????? to reply to (?µ???????? ????), to answer any one; ????? to command
(iubere aliquem); ????? to remember; ????? (also with ??) to wait for any one (to expect any
one); ?? ???? to bring glad tidings to any one (see the Lexicon); ???? and ????? to commit
adultery (adulterare matronam); ????? to serve (colere); ????? to become surety for …,
and many others.

14:2; ????????? to make some one an object of craft, Gn 37:18; ????????? to strip a thing off oneself,
Ex 33:6; ????????? to bring on oneself the anger of any one, to anger him; ????????? to consider
something, Jb 37:14; ????????? to break something off from oneself, Ex 32:3. In Gn 34:9 after
?????????? make ye marriages, read

. Cf. § 54 f.

 instead of

???????

???????

????

?? ???

?????? ?????

3. So also it is only owing to a modification of the original meaning of a verb (except
where the expression is incorrect, and perhaps derived from the popular language), when
sometimes the remoter object (otherwise introduced by ??) is directly subordinated in the form
of an accusative suffix, e.g. Zc 7:5
though to say, have ye be-fasted me? have ye reached me with your fasting? Still more
strange is Jb 31:18
???
31:3, and in Aramaic Dn 5:6; but
accusative after a verb of giving, see ff. In 1 S 2:25 read ??????? for ???????; in Is 44:21, instead of
the Niph?al, read
; in Ez 29:3 either ????? ???? is to be read with Olshausen or ????? ???? (and
previously ???????) with Smend; in Ps 42:5 ??????? or ???????; in Ps 55:23 (where König takes ?????????
as he has given it to thee) we must certainly assume a substantive ????? (= fate?).

 he (the orphan) grew up to me as to a father; cf. Is 27:4, 65:5, Jer

 did ye fast at all unto me, even to me? as

 Jos 15:19 is to be regarded as a double

4. Whole classes of verbs, which, according to v above, are regarded as transitive, either

on account of their original meaning or (for the sake of analogy) by a modification of that
meaning, are—

(a) Verba induendi and exuendi, as ????? to put on, ? ???? to put off a garment, ????? to put on

ornaments, to adorn oneself with (cf. also ????? ?????? ???? enclosed in gold, Ex 28:20). Also in
poetic expressions such as Ps 65:14 ?????? ?????? ??????? the pastures are clothed with flocks, cf.
Ps 109:29; 104:2 (?????); 65:14b (?????), &c.1

(cid:31)??

???? ??????

(b) Verba copiae and inopiae (also called verba abundandi and deficiendi), as ?????, to be
full of something, Ex 8:17; here, and also frequently elsewhere, construed with ????, and hence
evidently with an accusative; Gn 6:13; with a personal object, Ex 15:9 my lust shall be
satisfied upon them; with an accusative preceding the verb for the sake of emphasis, e.g. Is
 are full of blood, cf. Is 22:2; so also the Niph. ??????? to fill oneself
1:15 your hands
with something, e.g. Gn 6:11, Ex 1:7 (where the object is connected by ??); Is 2:7 f., 6:4, Pr
3:10; ??????? to be fructified with, Nu 5:28; ??? ?? to swarm with, Gn 1:20, 21 Ex 7:28;
)
to be full of, Is 1:11, Jo 2:19, Pr 12:11; ????? to become strong, to wax mighty in something, Jb
21:7; ????? to overflow with something, Pr 3:10 (with the object preceding); ????? prop. to
descend, poetically also to pour down, to overflow with something (cf. in Greek ????????
????, ?????? ???????), e.g. La 3:48
water; 1:16, Jer 9:17, 13:17, Ps 119:136; so also ?????? to run over with, to flow with, Jo 4:18;
????? to gush out with, Jer 9:17; ????? to drop, to overflow with, Ju 5:4, Jo 4:18a; ????? to break
forth, Ex 9:9;  ?? ???
 to overflow, but also (transitively) to overflow with, probably in Is 10:22;
??? to bud with, Pr 10:31; so perhaps also ????? to pass over, to overflow with, Jer 5:28; ????? to
go forth with, Am 5:3.—Especially bold, but still on the analogy of the above examples, is Is
 but it shall come up (it shall be overgrown)
????
5:6, where it is said of a vineyard
with briers and thorns; cf. Pr 24:31, and still more boldly, Is 34:13.

 mine eye runneth down (with) rivers of

?????? ????? ???
?? ???????

???? ???? ?? ???????

With the opposite idea, ????? to be in want of, to lack, Gn 18:28; ??? ?? to be bereaved of (as
 (prop. was there too little for

??????????

30:20 ????? ???????? they shall wash themselves with water; but the reading is simply to be
emended to the ordinary ???????.

us of …?) as being equivalent to a verbum inopiae (= had we too little of …?) is construed
with an accusative; cf. Neh 9:32.

(c) Several verbs of dwelling; the accusative in this case expresses either the place or the
thing at which or with which any one tarries; thus Gn 4:20, Ps 22:4 after ? ????, cf. § 118 g; Ju
5:17, Is 33:14 after ???; Ps 57:5 after ??? ??; Ps 68:7, Pr 8:12, Is 33:16 with ??? ??; or even the
person (the people) with whom any one dwells or is a guest, as Ps 5:5, 120:5 after ???, Gn
30:20 after ?????, Ps 68:19 with ??? ??.

5. Two accusatives (usually one of the person and one of the thing) are governed

by—

(a) The causative conjugations (Pi??l, Hiph???l, sometimes also Pilpel, e.g. ??????? Gn

??????????

47:12, &c.) of verbs which are simply transitive in Qal, and hence also of verba
induendi and exuendi, &c. (cf. above a and u, and also y, z), e.g. Ex 33:18
???????
???
 show me, I pray thee, thy glory. Thus very frequently ??????? to cause some
one to know something; ????? docere aliquem aliquid, &c.; cf. further, Gn 41:42  ?????????
? ?????????? ???? and he caused him to put on vestures of fine linen (he arrayed him in
vestures, &c.); cf. in the opposite sense, Gn 37:23 (both accusatives after ?? ??????
introduced by ???); so with ????? to fill, to fill up with something, Gn 21:19, 26:15, Ex
28:3; ????? to gird some one with something, Ps 18:33; ????? to crown, Ps 8:6, &c.; ????? to
cause some one to lack something, Ps 8:6; ????????? to feed some one with something,
Ex 16:32; ??? ???? to make some one drink something, Gn 19:32 ff.

 ??? ???

(b) Many verbs (even in Qal) which express an influence upon the object through
some external means. The latter, in this case, is attached as a second object. They are
especially—

(?) Verbs which express covering, clothing, overlaying, ????? Ex 29:9, ????? Ex 26:29, &c.,
???? Ez 13:10 ff., ????? Ps 5:13; cf. also ????? ????? Jos 7:25, &c.; hence also verbs which express
sowing (????? Jud 9:45 Is 17:10 30:23), planting (Is 5:2), anointing (Ps 45:8) with anything.

(?) Expressions of giving, thus ????? Jos 15:19 where the accusative of the thing precedes;

endowing, ????? Gn 30:20; and its opposite taking away, as ????? Pr 22:23; ?????? to bless some one
with something, Gn 49:25, Dt 15:14; to give graciously, ????? Gn 33:5; to sustain (i.e. to
support, to maintain, to furnish) with anything, e.g. Gn 27:37, Ps 51:14 (??????); Ju 19:5 (?????); to
do something to one, ????? Gn 50:15, 17, 1 S 24:18; cf. also ????? to come to meet any one with
something, Ps 21:4, ??? ?? to repay some one with something (with two accusatives, Ps 35:12,
Pr 13:21), and for the accusative of the person cf. ??, ????? ???????? ????. In a wider sense
we may also include such phrases as they hunt every man his brother with a net, Mi 7:2; to
shoot at one with arrows, Ps 64:8 (though this is against the accents); Pr 13:24 seeks him
early (with) discipline, i.e. chastises him betimes, &c.

(?) Expressions of asking some one for something, desiring something from some
one (?? ?? Dt 14:26, Ps 137:3); answering any one anything (????? Mi 6:5, &c.; cf. in the
other conjugations ????? ?? ???? prop. verbum reddere, with an accusative of the person, 1
K 12:6, &c., also in the sense of announcing; sometimes also ?????? to declare
something to some one, Jb 26:4, &c., for ?? ??????); ????? to enjoin a person something, Ex
34:32, Dt 1:18, 32:46, Jer 7:23.

(?) Expressions which mean to make, to form, to build something out of something; in

??? ? ???? ??????????

such cases, besides the accusative of the object proper, another accusative is used for the
material of which the thing is made, e.g. Gn 2:7
?????
the Lord formed man of the dust of the ground; so with ????? also in 1 K 7:15; further Ex 38:3
 all the vessels thereof made he of brass (for another explanation of the
?? ??
accusative
????? ??  [into brass], linguistically possible but excluded by the context, see below, ii
with kk); cf. Ex 25:18, 28, 26:1, 14 f.29, 27:1, 36:8, 1 K 7:27; with a preceding accusative of
the material, Ex 25:29, 29:2, Dt 27:6
thou build the altar of the Lord.

?? ??????????? ??????? ????? ?? ????????

 of unhewn stones shalt

?????????????? ????? ???????????

 ???????? ??????? ????

 and

?????

(c) Verbs which express making, preparing, forming into anything, along with the
object proper, take a second accusative of the product, e.g. Gn 27:9 ?????????? ????? ? ???????
I will make them (the kids) into savoury meat; cf. Gn 6:14, 16, Ex 261 b, 30:25, 32:4,
Is 44:15, Ho 8:4, 1 K 18:32 ????????? ???????? ??????????????? and he built the stones (into) an
altar; cf. 10:12. So also ????, with two accusatives, to bake something into something,
Ex 12:39, Lv 24:5; ?? ?? (prop. to set up for something, cf. Gn 27:37, 28:18, Ps 39:9,
and similarly ?????? Gn 31:45) to change into something, Jos 8:28, Is 50:2, 51:10, Mi
1:7, 4:13; with two accusatives of the person (to appoint, promote any one to the
position of a …), Is 3:7; ????? is also used in the same sense with two accusatives, Gn
17:5, and ?? ?? 1 K 11:34; as a rule, however, the description of the office, and also
frequently of the product, is introduced by ?? to, § 119 t; also ?? ?? to make a thing so
and so (Is 5:6, 26:1; with a personal object, Ps 21:7, 1 91:9); ??? ?????? to make dark, Am
? ?????? ????? ???  a stone they smelt
5:8. Of the same class also are instances like Jb 28:2
into brass; 1 K 11:30
pieces; cf. Is 37:26, accusative of the product before the object proper, after ??? ?????? to
lay waste. On a second object with verba sentiendi (as ????? to know something to be
something, Ec 7:25; ???? to see, find to be, Gn 7:1; ? ???? to esteem one to be something,
Is 53:4, elsewhere always construed with ?? or ??  ), cf. h.

 and rent it (the garment) into twelve

? ???? ???? ?? ??
?

????????

??????????

???

Rem. At first sight some of the examples given above appear to be identical in character

with those treated under hh; thus it is possible, e.g. in 1 K 18:32, by a translation which
equally suits the sense, he built from the stones an altar, to explain ???????? as the nearer object
and ??????????????? as an accusative of the material, and the construction would then be exactly
the same as in Dt 27:6. In reality, however, the fundamental idea is by no means the same.
Not that in the living language an accusative of the material in the one case, and in the other
an accusative of the product were consciously distinguished. As Driver (Tenses, § 195) rightly
observes, the remoter accusative in both cases is, strictly speaking, in apposition to the nearer.
This is especially evident in such examples as Ex 20:25 thou shalt not build them (the stones
of the altar) ?????? as hewn stones, cf. also Gn 1:27. The main point is, which of the two
accusatives, as being primarily affected (or aimed at) by the action, is to be made the more
prominent; and on this point neither the position of the words (the nearer object, mostly
determinate, as a rule follows immediately after the verb), nor even the context admits of
much doubt. Thus in 1 K 18:32 the treatment of the stones is the primary object in view, the
erection of the altar for which they were intended is the secondary; in Dt 27:6 the case is
reversed.

1 1 Cf. a very pregnant expression of this kind in Ps 21:13
 for thou
shalt make them (as) a neck, i.e. thou shalt cause them to turn their necks (backs) to
me; similarly Ps 18:41 (2 S 22:41, Ex 23:27);
enemies unto me as a back; cf. Jer 18:17.

 thou hast given mine

(cid:31)?? ??(cid:31)???

????? ??? ???

???? ????????

??? ???? ???

(cid:31)

(d) Finally, the second accusative sometimes more closely determines the nearer
object by indicating the part or member specially affected by the action,1 e.g. Ps 3:8
for thou hast smitten all mine enemies
??????  (as to) the cheek bone, equivalent to upon
the cheek bone; cf. Gn 37:21 let us not smite him
him; Dt 22:26, 2 S 3:27; also with ??? Gn 3:15; with ????? Jer 2:16; in poetry the object
specially concerned is, by a bold construction, even placed first, Dt 33:11 (with ?????).

??????  in the life, i.e. let us not kill

§ 118. The Looser Subordination of the Accusative to the Verb.

1. The various forms of the looser subordination of a noun to the verb are

distinguished from the different kinds of the accusative of the object (§ 117) by their
specifying not the persons or things directly affected by the action, but some more
immediate circumstance under which an action or an event takes place. Of such
circumstances the most common are those of place, time, measure, cause, and finally
the manner of performing the action. These nearer definitions are, as a rule, placed
after the verb; they may, however, also precede it.

Rem. That the cases thus loosely subordinated to the verb are to be regarded as
accusatives is seen first from the fact that in certain instances the nota accusativi (??) is
prefixed; secondly from the fact that in one form of the casus loci a termination (? ??) is
employed, in which (according to § 90 c) the old accusatival ending is preserved; and finally
from the consistency with which classical Arabic puts these nearer definitions in the
accusative (which may be recognized by its form) even under circumstances in which one
would be rather inclined to expect a nominative in apposition.

The relation subsisting between the circumstantial accusative and the accusative of the
object is especially apparent when the former (as e.g. in a statement of the goal after a verb of
motion) is immediately connected with its verb. But even the more loosely connected
circumstantial definitions are certainly to be regarded as originally objects of a governing
word habitually omitted, only that the consciousness of this closer government was at length
lost, and the accusative more and more acquired an independent value as a casus adverbialis.

2. The accusative serves to define more precisely the place (accus. loci), either (a)

in answer to the question whither? after verbs of motion,1 or (b) in answer to the
question where? after verbs of being, dwelling, resting, &c. (but also after transitive
verbs, see the examples), or finally (c) to define more precisely the extent in space, in
answer to the question how far? how high? how much?, &c.

Instead of the simple accusative, the locative (see above, § 90 c)2 is frequently found in

the cases mentioned under f (sometimes also in those under g) or the preposition ????,3
especially before persons as the aim of the movement, or ??, usually, to express being at a
place.

1 1 Analogous to this is the ???µ? ???? ???? ??? ???? µ???? in Greek epic poetry,
e.g. ????? ?? ???? ???? ????? ???????.
1 1 So commonly in Sanskrit; in Greek only poetically, e.g. Iliad i. 317 ????? ??
??????? ????: in Latin, e.g. rus ire, Romam proficisci.
2 2 Hence e.g. in 1 S 9:26 the Masora requires
3 3 So in Ju 19:18 for ?? ???????? the better reading is ??????.

 instead of the Keth. ?????.

4:9, 17:10, Ju 1:26, 2 K 11:19, Na 1:8 (?), Ps 134:2; with ????? Nu 23:14; with ????? Jos 6:24;
with the accus. loci emphatically preceding (cf. Driver on 1 S 5:8), 1 K 2:26, Is 23:12, Jer
2:10, 20:6, 32:5; with ??? (in the sense of aggredi, equivalent to ??? ????, cf. § 117 a, note 2)
the personal aim also is poetically added in the accusative, Ez 32:11, 38:11, Pr 10:24, 28:22,
Jb 15:21, 20:22; but in the last passage it is better taken as an accusative of the object (cf. the
German einen ankommen, überkommen). See also Nu 10:36 (where ??? can hardly be
transitive); Ju 11:29, 1 S 13:20 (where, however, ???? has probably fallen out after ?????; so
Strack).—Finally, cf. also the use of ? ???? for
??????
occurs after a passive, e.g. Gn 12:15.

Examples of (b): Gn 38:11 remain a widow ?????? ???? in thy father’s house; cf. Gn 24:23, 1
 in the tent door, Gn 18:1,

S 17:15, 2 S 2:32, Is 3:6, Hos 12:5, Mi 6:10, 2 Ch 33:20;
10, 19:11, and frequently. As observed by Driver on 1 S 2:29, accusatives of this kind are
almost without exception (but cf. 1 K 8:32, Is 16:2, 28:7, 2 Ch 33:20) connected with a noun
in the genitive. In all the above examples, however, the accusative may have been preferred to
the natural construction with ?? (which is not rare even with ???? and
reasons, in order to avoid the combination of such sounds as ???? and ????; cf., moreover, Gn
 Ex 29:13, &c.); Dt 1:2, 19, 1 2
2:14, 4:16, Ex 18:5, Lv 6:8 (?????????? instead of the usual
S 17:26, 1 K 7:8, Pr 8:3, 9:14. On Is 1:30 see § 116 i; on ? ????, with the accus. loci, see § 117
bb. On the other hand, in Dt 6:3, according to the LXX, a verb of giving has dropped out
before

?????? ) for euphonic

?????? .

Examples of (c): Gn 7:20 fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; Gn 31:23, 41:40  ???

???? ??????? ???????

???
 only in the throne will I be greater than thou; Dt 1:19 we went (through) all
that great and terrible wilderness; cf. Jb 29:3. Of the same kind also are such cases as Ex
16:16 (according to the number of your persons, for which elsewhere ?????????? is used); 1 S 6:4
(with the accus. preceding); 6:18, 2 S 21:20, Jb 1:5.—A statement of weight is put in the
accusative in 2 S 14:26.

3. The accusative is employed to determine more precisely the time (accus.
temporis), (a) in answer to the question when? e.g. ????? the day, i.e. on the day (in
question), at that time, but also on this day, i.e. to-day, or finally by day, equivalent to
?????, like
????
??????
at noonday, Ps 91:6; ????? ??? on one and the same day, Gn 27:45; ??? ?? in sleep, Ps
127:2; ?????? ?? ?????? ??????? (Qerê ?????) at the beginning of barley harvest, 2 S 21:9; in
stating a date, Gn 11:10, 14:4 in the thirteenth year.

 in the morning, early, Ps 5:4, &c.,

??????  at evening,

 noctu,

????????

???????

(b) In answer to the question how long? e.g. Gn 3:14, &c.,

???? ?????????

 all the days

????

of thy life; 7:4 forty days and forty nights; 7:24, 14:4, 15:13, 21:34, 29:18, Ex 20:9
(for six days); 23:15, 31:17; ????????? for ever, 1 K 8:13; also with the accusative made
determinate, Ex 13:7 ???????? ????? ?? ??? throughout the seven days in question, mentioned
immediately before; cf. Ju 14:17, Dt 9:25.

4. The accusative is sometimes used of abstract ideas to state the reason (accus.

causae), e.g. Is 7:25 thou shalt not come thither ???? ?? ?????? for fear of briers.

1 1 In Ps 2:12
of respect (with regard to the way); see below, m.

??(cid:31)????

 is not to be taken as an accus. loci (on the way), but as an accus.

5. Finally the accusative is used very variously (as an accus. adverbialis in the
narrower sense), in order to describe more precisely the manner in which an action or
state takes place. In English such accusatives are mostly rendered by in, with, as, in
the form or manner of …, according to, in relation to, with regard to. For more
convenient classification we may distinguish them as—

(a) Adjectives expressing state, placed after the verb to describe more accurately some
bodily or other external condition, e.g. Is 20:2 walking ??????? ????? naked and barefoot; cf. verse
3, 8:21, Gn 15:2, 33:18 (??? ??), Ju 8:4, Mi 1:8, Ps 107:5 (but in 15:2 ?????? is rather a substantive
directly dependent on ?????? = he that walketh in uprightness; cf. § 117 r, note); Jb 30:28. After
an accusative, e.g. Dt 15:18; to specify some mental state, e.g. Gn 37:35 (????).—Before the
verb (and then with a certain emphasis), Am 2:16, Jb 1:21, Ec 5:14; Lv 20:20, Jb 19:25,
27:19, 31:26 (unless ????? be a substantive); Ru 1:21 (?????? parallel with the adverb ??????). In Mi
2:7 the text is clearly corrupt.

Those examples are especially instructive in which the adjective expressing a state,
although referring to several, is nevertheless used in the singular, e.g. Jb 24:10 ?????? ?????
naked, i.e. in the condition of one naked, they go about; cf. verse 7 and 12:17. In Is 20:4 the
singular occurs after a plural object, and in Is 47:5 the masc. after the 2nd sing. fem.
imperative, which clearly proves that the term expressing the state is not conceived as being
in apposition, but as an indeclinable adverb.

(b) Participles, again either after the verb, Nu 16:27, Jer 2:27, 43:2, Ps 7:3, Jb 24:5, Ct

2:8, or before it, Gn 49:11, Is 57:19, Ez 36:35, Ps 56:2, 92:14, Pr 20:14; cf. also the
substantival use of the participles Niph(cid:31)al ???????? in a fearful manner (Ps 139:14) and ?????????
in a wonderful manner, Jb 37:5, Dn 8:24.—Also participles in connexion with genitives, as
?????????? Gn 3:8 (cf. also ???? 1 K 14:6), are to be regarded as expressing a state and not as being
in apposition, since in the latter case they would have to take the article.—In 2 S 13:20, 1 K
7:7 and Hb 2:10 the explicative W?w (equivalent to and that too) is also prefixed to the
participle. In Ps 69:4 for ??????? read  ???????
on § 131 h.

.—On 1 K 11:8, 2 K 10:6, 19:2, Hag 1:4, cf. the note

(c) Substantives1 in the most varied relations: thus, as describing an external state, e.g. Mi

2:3 ????? ??????? ????? neither shall ye walk haughtily (as opposed to ???? ?? Is 60:14); Lv 6:9
(accus. before the verb=as unleavened cakes), Dt 2:9, 4:11, Ju 5:21, Is 57:2, Pr 7:10, Jb 31:26,
La 1:9; as stating the position of a disease, 1 K 15:23 he was diseased ???????????? in his feet (2
Ch 16:12 ??????????), analogous to the cases discussed in § 117 ll and § 121 d (d); as describing a
spiritual, mental, or moral state, e.g. Nu 32:14, Jos 9:2 (????? ??? with one accord, 1 K 22:13; cf.
Ex 24:3, Zp 3:9), 1 S 15:32, 2 S 23:3, Is 41:3 (unless ??? ?? is adjectival, and the passage is to
be explained as in n); Jer 31:7, Ho 12:15, 14:5, Ps 56:3, 58:2, 75:3, Pr 31:9, Jb 16:9, La 1:9;
Lv 19:16, &c., in the expression ?????? ?????? to go up and down as a tale-bearer; also
unawares, Gn 34:25, Ez 30:9; ???? ?????? uprightly, Ps 58:2, 75:3 (in both places before the
verb); as stating the age, e.g. 1 S 2:33 (if the text be right)
i.e. in the prime of life; cf. 1 S 2:18 (
more accurately, Dt 4:27, 1 S 13:17, 2 K 5:2, Jer 31:8 [in Jer 13:19 ?????? ?? wholly (?) is
corrupt; read ????? ?? ????? with LXX for ?? ???????]; as stating the consequence of the action, Lv
15:18, &c.

?? ?????? ???
?????? ), Is 65:20, and Gn 15:16; as specifying a number

 they shall die as men,

??????

????

The description of the external or internal state may follow, in poetry, in the form of a
comparison with some well-known class, e.g. Is 21:8 ?????? ????????? and he cried as a lion; cf. Ps

1 1 Cf. above, § 100 c, on certain substantives which have completely become
adverbs; and § 113 h and k on the adverbial use of the infinitive absolute.

22:14, Is 22:18 (????? like a ball); Is 24:22, Zc 2:8, Ps 11:1 (unless ????? be vocative); 589 b
(unless the force of the preceding ??   is carried on, as in Ps 90:4); Ps 144:12, Jb 24:5 (????????,
before the verb); 41:7 shut up together as with a close seal.2

6. To the expressions describing a state belong finally those nouns which are
introduced by the comparative particle ??  , 3 since the ??   is to be regarded as originally a
substantive1 in the sense of amount, kind (instar), standing in the accusative (so that ??
is equivalent to as a kind of, after the manner of, according to), while the following
noun represents a genitive governed by the ??  . From this, which is the proper meaning
of the ??  , may be explained its power of representing a great many pregnant relations,
which in English can only be rendered by the help of prepositions.2 Thus the
comparison may refer to—

(a) The place, e.g. Is. 5:17 ????????? after the manner of, i.e. as in their pasture; 23:15 as (it

is said) in the song of the harlot; 28:21, 29:7 ??????? as in a dream.

(b) The time, especially in the combination ????? after the manner of the day, equivalent to
as in the day, Is 9:3, Ho 2:5; ?????? as in the days of …, Is 51:9, Ho 2:17, 9:9, 12:10, Am 9:11;
cf. moreover, Lv 22:13, Ju 20:39, Is 17:6, Jb 5:14, 29:2, and the expressions ????? ????? as day
???? ???
by day=as in the former days, 1 S 18:10;
??? ???? as in former years, 2 K 17:4; cf. § 123 c. Of a different character is the use of ??   as a
simple particle of time, e.g. Gn 18:10 ????? ????? at this time (not about the time), when it lives
again, i.e. at the end of a year; ????? ????? to-morrow at this time; cf. Is 23:5, and the frequent
connexion of ??   with the infinitive construct to express a definite time (in the sense of a
pluperfect), Gn 12:14, 27:34, Ex 9:29, &c.

 as at other times, 1 S 3:10, &c.;  ??? ????

????

?????

(c) The person, e.g. Gn 34:31 should he deal with our sister as with a harlot?

(d) The thing, e.g. Is 10:14, Ps 33:7, Jb 28:5 ???????? as a fire, i.e. as it were by fire (cf. Is

1:25 ????? as with lye); Jb 29:23 ??????? as for the rain (they waited for me); Jb 38:14 (as in a
garment); 38:30 ??????? as to stone (the waters are solidified in freezing).

2 2 It is, as a matter of fact, permissible to speak of the above examples as comparatio
decurtata, but it must not be assumed that the comparative particle ??  , which is
otherwise regularly prefixed (see s), has actually dropped out.
3 3 On the use of ??   as a prefix, cf. § 102 c.
1 1Schwabe (??   nach seinem Wesen und Gebrauch im alttestam. Kanon gewuürdigt,
Halle, 1883) contests this explanation (which is defended especially by Fleischer and
is certainly indisputable). He, with Gesenius and Ewald, places ??   as a preposition on
the same footing as ?? and ??, and believes it to be probably connected with the stem ???
as well as with ??? and ???. The above view of ??   as a substantive of course does not
imply that the language as we have it is still in every case conscious of the
substantival meaning.—On ??   in numerical statements, in the sense of about, nearly,
see the Lexicon.
2 2 It would be altogether unsuitable here also (see above, note 2 on r) to assume a
loss of the preposition. Such examples as Is 1:26 (????????????? and ???????????), Lv 26:37
(?????????) are to be explained from the fact that here the preposition and substantive had
already become simply one word before the ??   was prefixed. We find also ????? Is 59:18,
63:7, Ps 119:14, and 2 Ch 32:19; cf. Driver on 1 S 14:14 (??????????), where the text is
wholly corrupt.

Rem. According to the earlier grammarians, ??   is sometimes used pleonastically, i.e. not to

????????

. Such a pleonasm is of course out of the question. At the most a Kaph

indicate a similarity (as in Lv 14:35 as it were, i.e. something like), but simply to introduce
the predicate (Kaph veritatis), e.g. Neh 7:2 for he was ????? ?????? a faithful man; cf. 1 S 20:3
? ??????, La 1:20
veritatis can only be admitted in the sense that the comparison is sometimes introduced by ??
with a certain emphasis (equivalent to in every respect like); thus ????? ?????? in Neh 7:2 means
simply of the nature of a faithful man, i.e. as only a faithful man can be; cf. Nu 11:1, Is 1:7,
13:6, Ho 4:4, 5:10, Ob 11, Jb 24:14, 27:7, La 1:20, 2:4; also ??????? in such passages as Ps
105:12 yea, very few; but e.g. in Is 1:9 only just, a very small …

§ 119. The Subordination of Nouns to the Verb by means of Prepositions.

1. In general. As is the case with regard to the looser subordination of nouns to the

verbal idea (§ 118), so also their subordination by means of prepositions is used to
represent the more immediate circumstances (of place, time, cause, purpose, measure,
association, or separation) under which an action or event is accomplished. In the case
of most prepositions some idea of a relation of space underlies the construction,
which then, in a wider sense, is extended to the ideas of time, motive, or other
relations conceived by the mind.

On the origin of the prepositions and the original case-relation in which they stand to the
nouns governed by them, cf. § 101, where a list of the prepositions is given with their original
meanings. Cf. also § 102 on the prefixes, and § 103 on the union of prepositions with suffixes.

2. A not unimportant part is played in Hebrew by the compounding of prepositions
to represent more accurately the relations of place, which either precede or follow the
action. In the former case ????, and in the latter (which is not so frequent) ???? occurs
before other prepositions of place; cf. e.g. Am 7:15 the Lord took me ?????? ????????? from
behind the flock; 2 K 9:18 turn thee ??????????? to behind me, i.e, turn thee behind me;
??????, ????? from being with …, as in French de chez, d’après quelqu’un.1 For further
examples, see c.

Rem. 1. We must not regard as combined prepositions in the above sense either those
substantives which have become prepositions only by their union with prefixes, as ??????? before,
???????,
adverbs, which are also formed by combining words which were originally substantives (also
used as prepositions) with prepositions, as ????? without,

 on account of (but e.g. ????????? from before, Gn 4:16, &c., is such a compound); nor

 in the sense of below, 2 ?????

????????

????????

1 1 In other cases French, as well as English and German, can only emphasize one of
the two combined ideas; thus, such expressions as il prend le chapeau sur la table,
German and English er nimmt den Hut vom Tisch, he takes his hat from the table, all
regard the action from one point of view only; the Hebrew here brings out both
aspects of it by means of ?????? from upon, cf. e.g. Is 6:6.
2 2 Hence not to be confounded with
22:27, which is a real compound preposition. In the above-mentioned adverbs also the
???? was originally by no means pleonastic;
regarded primarily as a place from beneath which something proceeds, and so on.
This original sense of the ????, however, has become so much obscured by its regular
combination with words of place to form independent adverbs, that it is even prefixed
(evidently only on the analogy of such common adverbs as ??????,
) in cases
where it is really inadmissible, owing to the meaning of the adverb, e.g. in ???????????,

 from under, in such examples as Pr

 denotes properly the locality,

????(cid:31)???

????(cid:31)???

????(cid:31)???

above (so also in Gn 27:39, 49:25, not from above). These adverbs of place, however, may
become prepositions by the addition of ??, e.g. ?? ????? outside as regards …, i.e. outside of
something, in 1 K 21:13 even after a transitive verb of motion;
i.e. under something (cf.
?? ???
????????
?
&c.; ????? prop. in separation; ???? ????? in separation from, i.e. apart from, besides. Only rarely
in such a case is the ?? omitted for the sake of brevity, e.g. Jb 26:5
waters; Neh 3:28 (??????).

?? ???
 until they came under …, 1 S 7:11), ?? ????? over something,

 below as regards …,

 beneath the

????? ???

?????

2. Real combinations of prepositions (each retaining its full force) occur—

(a) With ????, in ??????,

???????  (see above) from behind something; ????? and ????? from with
(see above); ?????? or ???????? from between something (with motion in either direction, see e.g.
Gn 49:10); ????????? from before (see above); sometimes also ????? Lv 5:8, &c.;
??????  from upon,
i.e. off from;

 away from under (see footnote 2 on p. 377).

??

????????

(b) With ????, in ??????????? to behind, ?????????? to between; ?? ?????????? forth between 2 K 11:15;

 down under.1—In Jb 5:5 the two
?? ????????? forth without, i.e. out in front of, Nu 5:3;
prepositions of motion are combined in a peculiarly pregnant construction, ???????????? (he goes
thither and takes it) out of the thorns, i.e. he taketh it even out of the thorns, but the text is
hardly correct.

??????????

3. A general view of the union of certain verbs, or whole classes of verbs, with

particular prepositions, especially in explanation of certain idioms and pregnant
expressions.2

3 towards, properly an expression of motion or at least direction towards
something (either in the sense of up to=???, or into=????????), is used after verbs not only in

??????
question where? e.g. Jer 41:12 they found him

stood for the usual ???? ?????. In reality, however, the preposition which forms the adverb
 without a following ?? (see above).
into a preposition is omitted here, as in ?????,
Properly ??????? has a purely adverbial meaning=taken by itself, like
(cid:31)???
(Syriac men le??l) above (adv.), as distinguished from
men), over, upon something.—Also ?????? from … onward is not for ??????, but the ??
serves merely (just like the Latin usqus in usque a, usque ad, usqus ex) to indicate
expressly the starting-point, as an exact terminus a quo (of place or time).
1 1 Also in 1 S 21:5
idea of coming into, contained in the preceding ?????.
2 2 A summary of all the relations and senses in which a preposition may be used,
belongs not to the Grammar but to the Lexicon.
3 3 Cf. Mitchell, ‘The proposition el, ’ in the Journal of the Society of Biblical
Literature and Exegesis, 1888, p. 143 ff., and especially A. Noordtzij, Het
hebreeuwsche voorzetsel ??, Leiden, 1896, a thorough examination of its uses, and
especially of the relation between ???? and ????.

???? ?????
 or ???????? (Syriac le??l

??????(cid:31)???

??????(cid:31)

for ??, the Latin in potestatem, in amicitiam ditionemque esse, manere (Cic. Verr. 5, 38; Div.
2, 14, &c.); cf. also the common German expressions zu Hause, zu Leipzig sein, zu Bette
liegen, &c.

(b) ??.1 Underlying the very various uses of this preposition is either the idea of being or
moving within some definite region, or some sphere of space or time (with the infinitive, a
simultaneous action, &c.), or else the idea of fastening on something, close connexion with
something (also in a metaphorical sense, following some kind of pattern, e.g. the advice or
command of some one
 in
our image, after our likeness; cf. 1:27, 5:1, 3), or finally the idea of relying or depending upon
…, or even of merely striking or touching something.

upright among men; in the sense of consisting of, in specifying the constituents of a collective
idea, e.g. Gn 7:21 and all flesh died … in (=consisting of) fowl, &c. 8:17, 9:10, Ho 4:3. Also
after ideas of appearing, manifesting oneself, representing, being, in the sense of as, in the
capacity of (prop. in the sphere, after the manner of, see above), consisting of …, tanquam,
the ?? essentiae of the earlier grammarians, corresponding to the Greek ??, the Latin in, 2 and
the French en, e.g. Ex 6:3 I appeared unto Abraham … ??? ?? ????? as El Shaddai; Jb 23:13  ?????
??????? but he is (manifests himself as) one, i.e. he remains always the same; Dt 26:5, 28:62  ???????
????? in the condition of being few, cf. 10:22 to the number of seventy; Is 40:10, Ps 39:7.—Cf.
also such examples as Ex 18:4 (Ps 35:2, 146:5) ????????? as my help; Dt 26:14 being unclean; Is
28:16 in Sion (i.e. I make Sion a foundation); Ez 20:41 as a sweet savour; Pr 3:26, perhaps
also Ex 3:2 in (i.e. as) a flame of fire; Is 66:15 with (i.e. like) fire; Ps 31:22, 37:20 (1024). For
???? ???????
the origin of all these forms of expression Ps 54:6 is especially instructive, since
? ?????? is not meant to refer to the Lord as belonging to the ?????????, but only to ascribe to him a
similar character, i.e. the Lord is one who upholds my soul; so also Ps 99:6, 118:7, Ju 11:35
[the plur. as in § 124 g–i].3—Cf. Gesenius, Thes. Linguae Hebr., i. 174 f., and Delitzsch on Ps
35:2.

 ??????

(2) To introduce the object after transitive verbs, which denote touching, striking,

reaching to (thus to some extent a fastening on, see above) something, in English sometimes
rendered by at, on, &c., and in German generally by compounds with an, e.g. anfassen=?? ????,
anrühren=?? ?????, &c. To the same category belongs also the construction of verbs denoting
authority (??????, ? ????, ?????, ?????, the last prop. to tread on …) with ??, inasmuch as the exercise of
the authority is regarded as a laying hold of the person ruled; so also, the introduction of the
object by ?? after certain verba dicendi, or when the mental action is to be represented as
extending to some one or something: e.g. ?? ????? to call on some one, ?? ??? ???? iurare per
aliquem, ?? ?? ?? to enquire of some one. Again; ?? ???? to look upon, ?? ??? ?? to hearken to (but cf.
also m), generally with the secondary idea of participation, or of the pleasure with which one
sees or hears anything, especially pleasure at the misfortunes of others, hence ?? ???? to see his

1 1 Cf. Wandel, De particulae Hebr. ?? indole, vi, usu, Jena, 1875.
2 2 e.g. res in praeda captae, i.e. things taken as spoil; see Naägelsbach, Lat. Stilistik,
§ 123:4. On the Hebrew ?? essentiae, see Hauschild in the Festschrift zur Einweihung
des Goethegymn. Frankf. a. M. 1897, p. 163.
3 3 Other instances formerly cited here (Is 26:4, Ps 55:19, where ?? is used before the
subject) as well as Ps 68:5 ?? ?? ????? Jah is his name, are textually very uncertain. Cf.
Cheyne, SBOT. Isaiah, p. 173, on Is 26:4.

desire on any one or anything; cf. however, Gn 21:16 let me not look upon the death of the
child; 1 S 6:19 because they had looked [irreverently] at the ark of the Lord.

Closely related to this is the use of ??:

(3) To introduce the person or thing, which is the object of a mental act, e.g. ?? ????????? to
trust in (to cleave trustingly to) somebody or something; ?? ????? to have confidence in …;  ??? ??
?? to rejoice in or at something, &c.; ?? ????? to speak of (about) some one or something, Dt 6:7,
1 S 19:3 f., &c.

(4) The idea of an action as extending to something, with at the same time the secondary
idea of participation in something, underlies finally the partitive use of ??, e.g. ?? ???? to share
in eating something, Ex 12:43 ff., Lv 22:11; also simply to eat, to taste of something, Ju
13:16, Jb 21:25; so also ?? ????? to eat of, and ?? ??? ??1 to drink of something, Pr 9:5; ?? ??? ?? to
hear a whisper of something, Jb 26:14; ?? ????? they found remaining of her only …, 2 K 9:35;
?? ? ???? to bear a share of something, Nu 11:17, Ez 18:20, Jb 7:13. Cf. also ?? ????? to give a share
of something, Jb 39:17; ?? ????? to do building to, Neh 4:4.

(5) With the idea of touching, striking against anything is naturally connected that of
proximity and vicinity near, and further that of association with something; cf. Gn 9:4 ????????
with the life thereof; 15:14, 32:11 ????????? with my staff. Sometimes ?? combined with a verb of
motion (to come with something), expresses the idea of bringing, e.g. Ju 15:1 Samson visited
his wife with a kid, i.e. he brought her a kid; Dt 23:5, Ps 66:13, 1 Ch 15:19 ff., 16:6.

(6) From the idea of connexion with something, being accompanied by something (see n),

is developed, finally, the instrumental use of ??, which represents the means or instrument (or
even the personal agent), as something with which one has associated himself in order to
perform an action; cf. Mi 4:14
(so also 44:6, parallel with ???? ????); Is 10:34, Ho 1:7, 12:14; cf. also ?? ????? to labour by means of
some one, i.e. to cause him to labour at it, Ex 1:14, &c. On ?? with the passive to introduce the
means or the author, see § 121 f.

 they smite with the rod; Is 10:24; Ps 18:30 ???? by thee

?????

????

A variety of the ?? instrumenti is ?? pretii (the price being considered as the means of
acquiring a thing), cf. Gn 23:9, 29:18 (???????); 30:16, 33:19, 34:15 (?????? on this condition);
37:28; also, in a wider sense, Gn 18:28 ?? for the sake of; 1 S 3:13.

Rem. The use of ?? instrumenti to introduce the object is peculiar in such expressions as Ps

????

????????

 with the shadow of death; Jb 16:10

44:20 and thou coveredst over us
they have opened wide their mouth against me (prop. have made an opening with their
mouth); cp. Ps 22:8, Ex 7:20 he lifted up ??????? the rod; Lv 16:4 ????? and ????? followed by ??; Jos
8:18, La 1:17. Analogous to some English expressions we find both to gnash the teeth, Ps
35:16, and to gnash with the teeth, Jb 16:9; to wink the eye, Pr 10:10, and to wink with the eye,
Pr 6:13; shake the head, Ps 22:8, and to shake with the head, Jer 18:16, Jb 16:4.—In all these
instances the verb (intransitive) construed with ?? has a greater independence, and
consequently more emphasis than the verb construed with a direct accusative; the latter
conveys a sort of necessary specification of the action, while the noun introduced by ?? is used
rather as a merely adverbial complement. An instructive example of this is ??? ????? vocem

 ????? ???????

1 1 To be distinguished from ?? ??? ??=to drink from (a cup, &c., Gn 44:5, Am 6:6), as in
Arabic and Aramaic (Dn 5:2). Cf. also ?? ????????? (Xen. Anab. vi. 1, 4), ??
?????µ??? ?????? (3 Ezr 3:6), venenum in auro bibitur, Seneca, Thyestes 453, and the
French boire dans une tasse.

emittere, to utter a voice, also to thunder, while in ?????? ????? Ps 46:7 (6834, Jer 12:8), ????? has an
independent sense = he thundered with his voice (i.e. mightily).

(c) ??1 to, a very general expression of direction towards anything, is used to represent the
most varied relations of an action or state with regard to a person or thing. On the use of ?? as
a periphrasis for the genetivus poseessoris or auctoris (the idea of belonging to), see § 129; on
?? with the passive, to introduce the author or the cause, see § 121 f; on ?? in a purely local
sense (e.g. ??????????? at thy right hand, prop. towards thy right hand), or temporal (e.g.
????????
evening, &c.) or distributive, see the Lexicon

 at

The following uses of ?? properly belong to the government of the verb:

(1) As a nota dativi2 to introduce the remoter object; also

(2) To introduce the dativus commodi. This dativus commodi (or incommodi, e.g. Ez
37:11) is used—especially in colloquial language and in later style—in the form of a pronoun
with ??, as an apparently pleonastic dativus ethicus, with many verbs, in order to give
emphasis to the significance of the occurrence in question for a particular subject. In this
construction the person of the pronoun must always agree with that of the verbal form.3 By far
the most frequent use of this ?? is with the pronoun of the 2nd person after imperatives, e.g.
????????? go, got thee away, Gn 12:1, 22:2, Dt 2:13 (also in the feminine, Ct 2:10, 13); ???? ????? turn
thee aside, 2 S 2:21; ????? ???? take your journey, Dt 1:7; ????? ?????? pass ye over; ?????????? flee (to
save thyself), Gn 27:43; ?????????? get thee up, Is 40:9; ????? ???? turn you, Dt 1:40; ????? ???? return
???? ????
ye, Dt 5:27;
35:21 (in the plural, Is 2:22);
almost regularly
yourselves; ???? ????? be thou like, Ct 2:17 (cf. verse 9), 8:14, is remarkable; after a perfect
consecutive, 1 K 17:3, 1 S 22:5; after an imperfect consecutive, e.g. Is 36:9 ???? ????????? and
puttest thy trust.—In the 3rd person, e.g.
18:27, Ps 120:6, 123:4, Jb 6:19; even after a participle, Ho 8:9.—In the 1st person plural, Ez
37:11.

 rise up, Ct 2:10; ????? ?? ?? abide ye, Gn 22:5; ???? ????? forbear thee, 2 Ch

????? ??  take you, Dt 1:13, Jos 18:4, Ju 20:7, 2 S 16:20, and so

 (see above, § 51 n) cave tibi! and ????? ?????????? take heed to

??? ? ??  and sat her down, Gn 21:16, cf. 22:5, Ex

???? ???

???

(3) To introduce the result after verbs of making, forming, changing, appointing to
something, esteeming as something; in short, in all those cases in which, according to § 117
ii, a second accusative may also be used.

(4) In loose connexion with some verbal idea in the sense of in reference to, with regard
to … (§ 143 e); so after a verbum dicendi, Gn 20:13; 1 K 10:23, cf. Is 36:9; even before the
verb, Jer 9:2.—To the same class belongs also the Lamedh inscriptionis (untranslatable in
English, and hardly more than a mere quotation-mark) which introduces the exact wording of
an inscription or title; thus Is 8:1 write upon it … (the words) ???? ??? ?? ????? (cf. verse 3, where
the ?? naturally is not used); Ez 37:16.

1 1 Cf. Giesebrecht, Die hebr. Präpos. Lamed, Halle, 1876.
2 2 Just as in the Romance languages the Latin preposition ad (Italian a, before vowels
ad>, French à, Spanish á) and in English to are used as a periphrasis for the dative.—
On the introduction of the nearer object by ??, cf. § 117 n.
3 3 Such expressions as the analogous English he plucked me ope his doublet, but me
no buts, and the like, are accordingly inadmissible in Hebrew.

(d) ???, originally (according to § 101 a) separation, 1 represents both the idea of distance,

separation or remoteness from something, and that of motion away from something, hence
also descent, origin from a place, Am 1:1.

(1) From the idea of separation is naturally derived on the one hand the sense of (taken)

from among …, e numero, e.g. Gn 3:1 subtil as none other of the beasts, &c.; cf. 3:14, Dt
33:24, 1 S 15:33, Ju 5:24 (so especially after the idea of choosing out of2 a larger class, 1 S
2:28; cf. Ex 19:5, &c.), and on the other hand, the sense of without (separated, free from …),
 without the bow (i.e. without one needing to bend a bow against them)
e.g. Is 22:3
they were made prisoners; cf. Jer 48:45 ?????? without strength; Ho 6:6, as the first half-verse
shows, not more than burnt offerings (as R. V.), but and not burnt offerings; Mi 3:6, Ps 52:5,
Jb 11:15, 19:26, 21:9, also such examples as Nu 15:24 far from the eyes, i.e. unobserved by
the congregation; Pr 20:3.

???? ? ??

?????

???

Here also belongs the use of ??? after the ideas of restraining, withholding from, refusing
to any one, frequently in pregnant expressions, which we can render only by complete final or
consecutive clauses, e.g. 1 S 15:23 he hath rejected thee
 away from (being) king, instead
of ?? ???????? (as in verse 26), that thou be no longer king; cf. 1 K 15:13, Is 17:1 ?????? so that it
is no longer a city; Jer 17:16, Jb 28:11 he bindeth the streams ??????? that they trickle not; Gn
16:2, 23:6 ??????? that thou shouldst not bury thy dead; Is 24:10.

?????????

The ??? has a still more pregnant force in those examples in which the idea of precluding
from anything is only indirectly contained in the preceding verb, e.g. Gn 27:1 his eyes were
dim ???????? away from seeing, i.e. so that he could not see; Is 7:8 Ephraim shall be broken in
pieces ????? that it be not a people (just as in Is 23:1, Jer 48:2, 42, Ps 83:5); Lv 26:13, Is 5:6,
49:15, 54:9, Ezr 2:62 (for other pregnant constructions with ??? see below, ff)3; on ??????? and
?????? without, cf. § 152 y.

??????(cid:31)???

1 1 Cf. O. Molin, Om prepositionen min i Bibelhebreisken, Upsala, 1893, and
especially N. Zerweck, Die hebr. Praep. min, Leipzig, 1893, who, instead of the
partitive meaning (formerly accepted by us also), more correctly takes ‘separation’ as
the starting-point of its various uses.
2 2 All the partitive uses of ??? also come most naturally under this idea of separation
out of a larger class. Thus ??? is used in the sense of some, something, and even one, in
such expressions as and he slew … also ?????????? ???????? (divers) of the princes of Israel,
2 Ch 21:4; ?????? Lv 4:2; 1 K 18:5; ????? ????? some of the blood of the bullock, Ex 29:12,
&c.; Jb 27:6 my heart doth not reproach me ??????? for any, i.e. for one, of my days;
 one of thy days, i.e. ever in thy life (this explanation is confirmed by 1 K
38:12
1:6; cf. also 1 S 14:45, 25:28). In this way also, the frequently misunderstood Hebrew
(and Arabic) idiom is to be explained, by which ??? before
???? ???????
ullus; e.g. Lv 4:2 and shall do
18:10; so before a nomen unitatis (see § 122 t), 1 S 14:45 (2 S 14:11, 1 K 1:52)
????? ??????????? not one hair of his head.—???? is used in the sense of the Arabic min el-
bey?n or explicative min (often to be simply translated by namely), e.g. in Gn 7:22 of
all that was, i.e. so far as it was, probably also Gn 6:2 (=whomsoever they chose).
3 3 On the use of ??? to express the comparative, which likewise depends on the idea of
distance from …, cf. below, § 133 a; on ??? as expressing the distance of time from a
fixed limit, in the sense of after, e.g. Ps 73:20 ???????? after awaking (cf. ??, ???????, ab
itinere), or after the lapse of …, e.g. Gn 38:24, Ho 6:2, and very frequently ????? from
the end of, i.e. after the lapse of …, see the Lexicon; also for the use of ??? to represent
resting beside anything, like the Latin prope abesse ab …

 any one of these things; 5:13, Dt 15:7, Ez

????? , ???? is equivalent to

(cid:31)???

(2) On the sense of motion away from anything depends the use of ??? after such ideas as

to take away from, to beware, to be afraid of, to flee, to escape, to hide oneself from (cf.
??????? ???, custodire ab), sometimes again in pregnant expressions, e.g. Is 33:15. On the
idea of starting from anything depends finally the very frequent causative use of ??? on
account of, in consequence of (cf. our that comes from …), prae, e.g. ????? for multitude, 1 K
8:5.

(e) ????.1 The two original local meanings of this preposition are upon (???)2 and over

(????, super).

(1) From the original meaning upon is explained the use of ???? after ideas of

commanding, commissioning (???? ?????), &c., inasmuch as the command, obligation, &c., is
laid upon the object. The construction is self-evident in the case of to lie, rest, lean, rely,
press upon something; cf. also, for the last, such examples as Is 1:14, Jb 7:20, 23:2, and
especially 2 S 18:11 ??????? prop. upon me would it have been, it would have been incumbent
upon me, &c.

(2) From the original meaning over is explained the use of ???? after ideas of covering,
protecting, guarding ???? ?????, ???? ?????; also the combinations ???? ????? to have compassion upon
…, ???? ???, ???? ????? to spare some one, arise from the idea of a compassionate or protective
bending over something. Cf. also ???? ??????? Ju 9:17 = to fight for some one, i.e. in his defence.

(3) Moreover ???? is used after verbs of standing and going, to express a towering over
some one or something, sometimes in phrases, in which the original local idea has altogether
fallen into the background, and which are therefore to be rendered in English by means of
other prepositions (by, with, before, near), e.g. Gn 41:1, &c., Pharaoh … stood ??????????? by
the Nile (above the water level; cf. Ps 1:3), and so especially
stand serving before some one (prop. over one who sits or reclines at table) Zc 4:14 (cf. Is
6:2, where
?? ???
Jb 1:6, &c. Cf. also  ??????

, ????????? (Jb 1:14) near, at (on) the side of some one or something.

 is used for ????); ???? ????????? to present oneself by command before some one,

 in the pregnant sense to

????

?????

?????

?

(4) From the original meaning above (not, as formerly, explained, on to something, at

something) there arise finally all the various constructions with ???? in the sense of towards,
against. The original idea (which in many of these constructions has become wholly
unrecognizable) starts from the view that the assailant endeavours to take up his position over
the person attacked, so as to reach him from above, or to over power him; cf. especially  ???
???? to rise up over, i.e. against some one, then with a transference of thought applied to any
kind of hostile approach, ???? ??????? to fight against …, ???? ????? to encamp againt …, ???? ???????? to
be gathered together, to assemble against (Mi 4:11; cf. Ps 2:2), &c.; even after verbs which
express a mental action, e.g. ???? ????? ? ???? to imagine evil against any one, &c.

4. Sometimes a preposition appears to be under the immediate government of a

verb, which, by its meaning, excludes such a union. In reality the preposition is

1 1 Cf. Budie, Die hebr. Präpos. (cid:31)Al (???), Halle, 1882.
2 2 Since the placing upon anything is an addition to it, ???? also implies in addition to
something, cf. Gn 28:9 (3150); 30:40, 32:12 (probably a proverbial saying=mother and
children); Dt 22:6. Also ??? notwithstanding is no doubt properly in addition to, e.g. Jb
10:7 although thou knowest, prop. in addition to thy knowing.—From the original
meaning upon is also derived that of on account of (prop. upon the ground of) and in
agreement with, according to, since the pattern is regarded as the foundation upon
which a thing stands or rests.

dependent on a verb (generally a verb of motion), which, for the sake of brevity, is not
expressed, but in sense is contained in what is apparently the governing verb.

Various examples of this constructio praegnans have been already noticed above in x and

????

??????? ?????? ??????????

y under ????; for ???? cf. also Ps 22:22
from the horns of the wild oxen (in Is 38:17, which Delitzsch translates by thou hast loved and
delivered my soul from the pit, read
also ???? ????? Ps 73:27 to go a whoring from any one i.e. to be unfaithful to him; ???? ? ???? Ps
18:22 = to depart wickedly from God; ???? ????? Ps 28:1 to be silent from one (to turn away in
silence); cf. Jb 1313 [; so with ????? Jb 30:17, 30].

 with the LXX); Gn 25:23, 2 S 18:19, Jb 28:12; cf.

Pregnant constructions with ???????: Nu 14:24 equivalent to

 and he made

full to walk i.e. walked fully after me; in 1 S 13:7 read with the LXX ?????????? ??????? they
trembled, i.e. went trembling away from him; with ???? Gn 43:33 ???? ????? to turn in
astonishment to some one (cf. Is 13:8); ???? ????? Is 11:10, &c., to turn inquiringly to some one;
???? ????????? Is 41:1 to turn in silence to some one; ???? ????? Gn 42:28 to turn trembling to some
one (cf. ???????? ????? to come trembling to meet, 1 S 21:2 [also with ???, ????, ??? and other
verbs, Ju 14:5, 15:14, 19:3; see Lexicon]); cf. further Jer 41:7, Ps 7:7, 2 Ch 32:1; with ?? Ps
55:19 he hath redeemed and hath put my soul in peace, exactly like Ps 118:5; with ?? Ps 74:7
they have profaned and cast … even to the ground; cf. 89:40.

5. In poetic parallelism the governing power of a preposition is sometimes
extended to the corresponding substantive of the second member;1 e.g. ?? Is 40:19,
48:14 he shall perform his pleasure ??????? on Babylon, and his arm shall be ???? ???? (for
???? ??????) on the Chaldaeans; Jb 15:3; ?? Is 28:6, 42:22 (but probably ?? has fallen out
after another ?), Ez 39:4, Jb 34:10 (perhaps also Gn 45:8; ? ??? may, however, be taken
 Is 48:9; ???? Is 58:13, Ps 141:9
here as a second accusative according to § 117 ii);
(unless ??????????? is to be read); ???? Is 15:8;

????????
??????  Is 61:7.

6. Adverbs which have acquired a substantival value are sometimes governed by

prepositions, e.g. ????????? in vain, Ez 6:10; ??????????? after this; ????? (Ec 8:10, Est 4:16)
then, on this condition; ????? and ??????? therefore; ??????? hitherto.

§ 120. Verbal Ideas under the Government of a Verb. Go-ordination of
Gomplementary Verbal Ideas.

1. When a relative verb (incomplete in itself) receives its necessary complement

in the form of a verbal idea, the latter is, as a rule, subordinated in the infinitive
construct (with or without ??), less frequently in the infinitive absolute, in a few
instances in the form of a participle (or verbal adjective), or finally in the imperfect
without the copula. In these combinations the principal idea is very frequently
represented by the subordinate member of the sentence, whilst the governing verb
rather contains a mere definition of the manner of the action; cf. d and g below, and §
114 n, note 2.

(a) On the subordination of an infinitive construct as an accusative of the object, and as

the complement of relative verbal ideas, see above, § 114 c, and the numerous examples

1 1 Similarly the force of a negative is sometimes extended to the parallel member;
see § 152 z.

given in § 114 m; on the infinitive absolute as object, see § 113 d.—The complement in the
form of a participle (as in Greek, and also frequently in Syriac) occurs in Is 33:1 ????? ????????????
(cf. for the form, § 67 v) when thou hast ceased as a spoiler, i.e. to spoil; Jer 22:30
 ??????? ???
? ??? he shall never prosper, sitting, i.e. so as to sit, &c.; Jon 1:6 what meanest thou, sleeping?
i.e. that thou sleepest;1 by a verbal adjective, 1 S 3:2 now his eyes
 had begun being
dim, i.e. to wax dim (unless we read ?????=???????, cf. § 114 m); by a substantive, Gn 9:20 and
Noah began to be an husbandman (omitting the article before

????? ??

??????? ).

?????

 ...

(b) Examples of the subordination of the complementary verbal idea in the imperfect2 (in

 ...

???????

 it pleased the Lord … to magnify, &c.; Jb

 I know not to give flattering titles; after a perfect consecutive, 1 S

English usually rendered by to, in order to or that) are—(1) with both verbs in the same
person: after the perfect, Is 42:21
 ????? ???????
??????? ?????
???? ???
30:28, 32:22
?
20:19 (where for ????? we should read with the LXX ???????); after an imperfect, Ps 88:11,
102:14, Jb 19:3, 24:14; after an imperf. consec., Jb 16:8; after a participle, Is 5:11a.—(2) with
a difference in the persons: after a perfect, Lv 9:6 this is the thing ??????? ??????? ??????? ???? which
the Lord commanded (that) ye should do; a negative imperfect follows ????? in La 1:10; after
the imperfect, Is 47:1 (5)
???? ??? ???
?
call thee, i.e. thou shalt no longer be called, &c.; Ho 1:6 ??????? ??? ?????? ??? I will no longer
continue (and) have mercy, i.e. I will no more have mercy; Is 52:1, Pr 23:35.—Nu 22:6
peradventure I shall prevail (that) we may smite thom, and (that) I may drive them out of the
land (????? may, however, be a scribal error for ?????, due to the preceding ?????, and in that case
the example would belong to No. 1); after a participle, 2 S 21:4.—A perfect is possibly
subordinated in La 1:10; but the explanation of

 for thou shalt no more continue (that) they

?????  as a relative clause is preferable.

????????????? ??? ????

2. Instead of subordination (as in the cases mentioned in a–c), the co-ordination of

the complementary verbal idea in the finite verb (cf. above, c) frequently occurs,
either—

(a) With the second verb co-ordinated in a form exactly corresponding to the first
(but see below, e) by means of ?? (??, ??).1 As a rule, here also (see above, a) the principal
idea is introduced only by the second verb, while the first (especially ???, ?????2, ??????)
contains the definition of the manner of the action, e.g. Gn 26:18
????????? ? ??  and he
?????
returned and digged, i.e. he digged again; 2 K 1:11, 13; in the perfect consecutive, Is
6:13; with ??????, e.g. Gn 25:1 and Abraham added and took a wife, i.e. again took a
wife; Gn 38:5 and frequently; with ?????? in the jussive, Jb 6:9; in the imperative (cf. §
110 h), Ju 1 6 ?????????? ?????? be content, I pray thee, and tarry all night (cf. the English he
was persuaded and remained, for to remain); 2 S 7:29; with ????? Gn 24:18, 20, &c.;
with ????? Ct 2:3.

????

??????? ??

 and the simple ???????.

1 1 In ??????? ?????? 1 S 16:16, which appears to be a case of this kind, two different
readings are combined,
2 2 This kind of subordination is frequent in Arabic and in Syriac (cf. e.g. the Peshi?tâ,
Luke 18:13); as a rule, however, a conjunction (corresponding to our that) is inserted.
Cf. moreover, the Latin quid vis faciam? Terence; volo hoc oratori contingat, Cicero,
Brut. 84; and our I would it were; I thought he would go.
1 1 Cf. the English colloquial expression I will try and do it.
2 2 Of a different kind are the cases in which ????? with a negative is co-ordinated with a
verb to emphasize the non-recurrence of the action; cf. Nu 11:25 they prophesied and
added not, sc. to prophesy, i.e. but they did so no more; Dt 5:19, Jb 27:19 (reading
??????? ?????).

Rem. 1. Instead of an exact agreement between co-ordinate verbal forms, other

combinations sometimes occur, viz. imperfect and perfect consecutive (cf. § 112 d), e.g. Dt
31:12 that they ??????????? ????????? ???????? may learn, and fear the Lord, i.e. to fear the Lord; Is 1:19,
Ho 2:11, Est 8:6, Dn 9:25b; perfect and imperfect, Jb 23:3 (O that I knew how I might find
him); perfect and imperfect consecutive, Jos 7:7, Ec 4:1, 7; jussive and imperative, Jb 17:10;
cf., finally, Gn 47:6
 and if thou knowest and there are among them, &c., i.e.
that there are among them.

????????? ????
?

?????????

2. Special mention must be made of the instances in which the natural

complement of the first verb is suppressed, or is added immediately after in the form
of an historical statement, e.g. Gn 42:25 then Joseph commanded and they filled3
(prop. that they should fill, and they filled …; cf. the full form of expression in Gn
50:2); a further command is then added by means of ?? and the infinitive; Ex 36:6;
another instance of the same kind is Gn 30:27 I have divined and the Lord hath
blessed me, &c., i.e. that the Lord hath blessed me for thy sake.

(b) With the second verb (which, according to the above, represents the principal

,

??

??????

?????? ?????

 come, let us go; Gn 31:44 and frequently.—Also with ??? (a periphrasis

idea) attached without the copula4 in the same mood, &c. In this construction (cf. §
, &c.) and ???? (?????, ?????, &c.) are exceedingly
110 h) the imperatives  ???  (
common with the sense of interjections, before verbs which express a movement or
other action, e.g. ?????????? ??? arise, walk, Gn 13:17, 19:15, 27:43; in the plural, Gn
19:14; Ex 19:24 ???????? go, get thee down; 1 S 3:9; with a following cohortative, 1 S
9:10
for again) in the perfect, Zc 8:15; in the imperfect, Mi 7:19, Ps 7:13, 59:7, 71:20; in
the jussive, Jb 10:16; in the cohortative, Gn 30:31; in the imperative, Jos 5:2, 1 S 3:5
lie down again; ?????? (sometimes to express the idea of willingly or gladly) in the
perfect, Dt 1:5, Ho 5:11; in the imperative, Jb 6:28; ???????=much, 1 S 2:3
 ???????? ???????
??????? do not multiply and talk, i.e. talk not so much arrogancy; in the imperative, Ps
51:4; ?????, Dt 2:24 ??? ????? begin, possess; ?????, La 4:14 ?????? ??????? ?????, without men’s
being able to touch, &c.; ?????=quickly, in the perfect, Ps 106:13; in the imperative, Gn
19:22, Ju 9:48, Est 6:10.—Other examples are: Ho 9:9 ?????????=deeply, radically; Zp
3:7 ???? ????=early (even in the participle, Ho 6:4, 13:3); Is 29:4 ??? ??=low, cf. Jer 13:18;
Jos 3:16 ?????=wholly; Ps 112:9 ?????=plentifully.

??

Rem. This co-ordination without the copula belongs (as being more vigorous and bolder)

rather to poetic or otherwise elevated style (cf. e.g. Is 52:1, Ho 1:6, 9:9 with Gn 25:1, &c.).
Asyndeton, however, is not wanting even in prose; besides the above examples (especially the
imperatives of ??? and ?????? Gn 30:31, Dt 1:5, 2:24, Jos 3:16, 1 S 3:5) cf. also Neh 3:20, 1 Ch
13:2. For special reasons the verb representing the principal idea may even come first; thus Is
53:11
 he shall see, he shall be satisfied (sc. with the sight), for the satisfaction does
not come until after the enjoyment of the sight; Jer 4:5 ?????? ?????? cry, fill, i.e. cry with a full
(loud) voice.

§ 121. Construction of Passive Verbs.

Blake, ‘The internal passive in Semitic,’ JAOS xxii.

3 3 Cf. the analogous examples in Kautzsch’s Gramm. des Bibl. Aram., §102.
4 4 To be distinguished, of course, from the cases in which two equally important and
independent verbs are used together without the copula in vigorous poetic imagery,
e.g. Ex 15:9, Jb 29:8, &c.

1. Verbs which in the active take one accusative (either of the proper object, or of

the internal object, or of some other nearer definition; cf. § 117 a, p, u) may in the
passive, according to our mode of expression, be construed personally, the object of
the active sentence now becoming the subject, e.g. Gn 35:19
Rachel died, and was buried, &c. The passive, however, is also used impersonally (in
the 3rd sing. masc.), either absolutely, as Dt 21:3f., Is 16:10, Ez 16:34 (with a dative
added, 2 S 17:16, Is 53:5, La 5:5), or, more frequently, with the object of the active
construction still subordinated in the accusative,1 e.g. Gn 27:42 ? ???? ??????????? ????????? ???????
and there were told (i.e. one told) to Rebekah the words of Esau; 2 S 21:11, 1 K
18:13.

????????? ????? ???

 and

?????

Other examples are: after Niph., Gn 4:18 ?????????? ????????? ????????? and unto Enoch was born
Irad (cf. Nu 26:60, and after an infinitive, Gn 21:5); Gn 17:5, 21:8 (after an infinitive); 29:27
(unless ????????? is 1st plur. cohortative); Ex 21:28, 25:28, Lv 6:13, Nu 7:10 (after an infinitive);
26:55 (cf. verse 53); Dt 20:8 (where, however, for ????? the Hiph. ????? should be read, according
to 1:28); Jos 7:15, Is 16:10; with the object preceding, Ex 13:7, Lv 2:8, 19:20, Nu 16:29, Dan
924.1— Also after Pu(cid:31)al, Jer 50:20; before Pu(cid:31)al, Is 14:3 (? ???? equivalent to the internal
object ???????=which they have caused to be served by thee); Jb 22:9; according to the
Masoretic text also Gn 46:22, where, however, the Samaritan and LXX read ???????? for ?????; the
Samaritan in Gn 35:26 and 46:27 also reads ???????, and this (or ?????) should certainly be read
instead of ?????? in 2 S 21:22.—After Hoph., Ex 10:8, 27:7, Lv 10:18, 16:27, Nu 32:5, 1 K 2:21,
Pr 16:33, Jb 30:15; after the infinitive Hoph., Gn 40:20, Ez 16:4 f., 27:7; before Hoph., Is
17:1, 21:2, Ho 10:6, Zc 13:6; after the infinitive Hothpa(cid:31)el, Lv 13:55 f.

2. Verbs which in the active take two accusatives (§ 117 cc) retain in the passive

construction at least one accusative, namely that of the second or remoter object,
whilst the nearer object now becomes the subject. Thus, corresponding to
which I will show thee (Gn 12:1) the passive is
hast been shown, i.e. which has been shown to thee; cf. Ex 26:30 (but in Lv 13:49
with an accusative of the person); Jb 7:3. In Ps 22:16  ???????? ???????
assumed transitive ???????? governing two accusatives (= my tongue is made to cleave to
my jaws); also in Is 1:20,
???????? ???  ye shall be devoured with the sword, ????? is not an
accus. instrumenti, but most probably an accusative of the object retained from the
active construction.2

????? ? ????
 (Ex 25:40) which thou

 depends on an

??????? ???? ?

????

???

???

??

1 1 When this is not recognizable either by the nota accusativi, or by its disagreement
with the passive form in gender, number, and person, it naturally cannot be
determined whether the construction is really impersonal. The construction itself can
only be explained by supposing that while using the passive form the speaker at the
same time thinks of some author or authors of the action in question, just as on the
theory of the Arab grammarians a concealed agent is included in every passive. This
accounts for the possibility (cf. § 144 g) of using the active without a specified subject
as a periphrasis for the passive.
1 1 In 2 K 18:30 ??????? is to be read or ???? is to be omitted, as in the parallel passage Is
36:15.
2 2 In the active, the sentence would be I will cause the sword to devour you; by the
rule stated above, under c, this would become in the passive, the sword (nom.) shall
be made to devour you (acc.). Instead of this, the remoter object is here made the
subject, and the nearer object is retained in the accusative. Otherwise, the only

Rem. 1. Examples of the retention of the second accusative are—(a) with verba induendi
and exuendi (§ 117 cc), Ps 80:11, ????? ?????? ???? the mountains were covered with the shadow of
it (the vine); Pr 19:23. So also some of the examples in § 116 k of passive participles of these
verbs, Ju 18:11, 1 S 2:18, 17:5, 1 K 22:10, Ez 9:2, 3; 1 with the accusative preceding, Neh
4:12.—(b) with verba copiae and inopiae, Ex 1:7, Is 38:10 (equivalent to I must forego the
residue of my years); Is 40:20.—(c) an accusative of the result (§ 117 ii) with the passive, Is
6:11, Zc 14:4, Jb 28:2; with the accusative preceding, Is 24:12, Mi 3:12 (Jer 26:18), Jb 15:7,
22:16.2 Also in Ez 40:17 and 46:23, the accusative preceding ????? (in 41:18 following it) can
only be taken as the accusative of the result; some general idea, such as that of place, is to be
understood as the subject of ?????.—(d) an accusative of the member or part specially affected
by the action (§ 117 ll), Gn 17:11, 14:24, Ju 1:7 (accusative before part. pass.); 2 S 15:32
(accusative with suffix after the part. pass.).

2. Both accusatives are retained in an unusual manner after the passive of a verbum
implendi in Nu 14:21; instead, however, of the Niph. ????????? the Qal (which is sometimes used
transitively elsewhere) should simply be read with the LXX; similarly in Ps 72:19, although
there the LXX also translate the passive.

3. The efficient cause (or personal agent) is, as a rule, attached to the passive by ??

??????? ?? ?

 the
(thus corresponding to the Greek and Latin dative), e.g. Gn 25:21
Lord let himself be intreated by him; cf. Lv 26:23, Ps 73:10 and the blessing  ??? ??????
????????? blessed be he of the Lord Ru 2:20; cf. Gn 14:19, Ju 17:2b, 1 S 15:13; also in
the plural, 1 S 23:21 (2 S 2:5, Ps 115:15).—Before the verb, Pr 14:20 and frequently;
less commonly by ???? (called ???? of origin=coming from), e.g. Gn 9:11; before the
verb, Ps 37:23, Jb 24:1; by ?? (instrumenti) [rarely, König § 106], Gn 9:6 (??????? by
man); Nu 36:2, Is 14:3 b [but ?=wherewith it was worked (§ 52 e) with thee; cf. Dt
21:3, König § 106; and see ?? ????? in the Lexicon], Ho 14:4, always to introduce a
personal

agent.—On the connexion of the passive participle with a genitive of the agent, cf.

§ 116 l.

§ 122. Indication of the Gender of the Noun.

especially the thorough investigation by K. Albrecht, ‘Das Geschlecht der hebr.

possible explanation would be, according to the Arabic idiom, to cause one to devour
the sword (remoter object), i.e. to give him over to it. It would then be simplest to
read ????????.
1 1 Analogous to ???????? ??????? who was clothed in linen, Ez 9:3, would be  ?????????
????? ??????????? 2 Ch 31:10; but we must certainly read there ??????? with the LXX.—Still
less can Ps 87:3 be so explained, ????????? being not an accusative, but the subject of a
noun-clause. On the other hand, ???? ?? 1 K 14:6 may be explained with Ewald in the
sense of being charged with something, so that, like ?????, it may be construed with an
accusative.
2 2 In reality ??????? Ex 16:20, 26 (it became putrid) is equivalent to a passive (it was
changed), to which  ????????

 is added as an accusative of the result.

Geschlecht der hebr. Hauptwörter, ’ in ZAW. 1905, p. 325 ff. (supplementing Albrecht’s
work by a treatment of the gender of many nouns in the Mishna); and his ‘Notizen aus der
tannaitischen Literatur …’ ZAW. 1908, p. 144 ff.

1. According to § 80 a, Hebrew, like the other Semitic languages, distinguishes
only a masculine and feminine gender. To indicate the latter a special feminine ending
is generally used (§ 80 b and § 87 i) both in the singular and plural (see, however, §
87 p), its use being most consistent in adjectives and participles; cf. § 87 r. The
employment of these special endings is most natural when by means of them the
feminine names of persons or animals are distinguished from the masculine of the
same stem and the same formation, e.g. ?? brother, ???? sister; ????? a young man, ???????
a young woman, maid; ??? iuvencus, ????? iuvenca; ????? vitulus, ??????? vitula. On the other
hand, the feminine plays an important part in denoting the gender of whole classes of
ideas (see below, p, &c.), which the Hebrew regards as feminine. The language,
however, is not obliged to use the feminine ending either for the purpose of
distinguishing the sex of animate objects (see b), or as an indication of the (figurative)
gender of inanimate things which are regarded as feminine (see h).

2. The distinction of sex may be effected even without the feminine ending, (a) by

the employment of words of different stems for the masculine and feminine; (b) by
the different construction (either as masculine or feminine) of the same word
(communia). But the distinction may also, (c) in the case of names of animals, be
entirely neglected, all examples of a species being included under one particular
gender, either masculine or feminine (epicoena).

Examples of (a) are: ?? father, ??? mother;  ?????

 ram, ????? ewe;

??????

 he-goat, ??? she-goat;

????? he-ass, ???? she-ass; ?????? lion, ?????? lioness. Sometimes with the feminine ending as well,
??????  male slave, man-servant, ???? or ????? ?? female slave, maid; ????? bridegroom, ????? bride.
e.g.

Of (b): ????? camel. Plur. ???????? construed as masculine, Gn 24:63; as feminine, Gn 32:16;
????? collect, oxen, Ex 21:37, construed as masculine, but in Gn 33:13, Jb 1:14 as feminine. In
Jer 2:24 the construction of
epicene) to the feminine.Cf. the Greek ?, ? ????· ?, ? ????.

??????  wild ass, changes directly from the masculine (intended as

Of (c): analogous to the epicene nouns of other languages, many species of animals which

are strong and courageous, are regarded in Hebrew as always masculine, while the weak and
timid are feminine; cf. ? ?????, ? ???????, and the German der Löwe, der Adler, &c., but die
Katze, die Taube, &c. Similarly in Hebrew, e.g. ???? ox (Ps 144:14 even referring to cows
when pregnant), ??? bear, Ho 13:8 ??? ?? ??? (a bear that is bereaved of her whelps; cf.,
however, 2 K 2:24, Is 11:7), ????? wolf,
???????? stork, ??????? bee, ??????? ant, &c., feminine.

??????  dog, all masculine; but

 hare, ??????? dove,

?????????

Rem. 1. Masculine nouns which either have a separate feminine form or might easily
form one, are but seldom used as epicene; such are, ????? ass, 2 S 19:27 for ????; ???? hart, Ps
42:2 for ??????. In Gn 23:3 ff. ??? a dead body, refers more especially to the body of a woman;
???? a master workman, in Pr 8:30 refers to wisdom (??????? feminine, cf. Plin. 2, 1 natura

ZAW. ZAW, = Zeitschrift für die alttestamentliche Wissenschaft, ed. by B. Stade,
Giessen, 1881 ff., and since 1907 by K. Marti.

omnium artifex; and our use of friend, teacher, servant, neighbour, either as masculine or
feminine; in German, Gemahl1 spouse, also for fem. Gemahlin, &c.).

2. Of words denoting persons

??????  ????, according to the formerly common opinion, was
in early times used as epicene (see, however, above, § 2 n). The use of the plural ???????? in Jb
1:19 and Ru 2:21 in the sense of young people (of both genders) does not, however, prove
this. In this and in similar cases (cf. e.g. ????? Gn 1:27 and ??????? 32:1) the masculine as prior
gender includes the feminine.2

3. The following classes of ideas are usually regarded as feminine,3 although the

substantives which express them are mostly without the feminine ending:4

(a) Names of countries and towns, since they are regarded as the mothers5 and
nurses of the inhabitants; e.g. ????? Assyria, ????? Idumaea, ??? Tyre; cf. also such
expressions as ????? ???, ????? ??? daughter of Babylon, daughter of Zion, &c. On the other
hand appellatives which are originally masculine, remain so when used as place-
names, e.g. Am 5:5 ????????, ?????????, &c.

Rem. The same proper nouns, which as names of countries are regarded as feminine, are

frequently used also as names of the people, and may then, like national names in other
languages, be construed as masculine (the national name almost always being used also as the
personal name of the supposed ancestor of the people); thus ??????? masc. Is 3:8, &c., Judaei;
but Is 7:6, fem., Judaea; ????? masc., Idumaei, Nu 20:20; fem., Idumaea, Jer 49:17.
Nevertheless, it sometimes happens that by a very common transference of thought (just as
we say Turkey concludes peace) these names are construed as feminine, even when they

 2 S 4:4, &c.), not nursing-father.

1 1 So in early Arabic, ba?l (lord) and zau? (conjux) are used both for maritus and
uxor; ?ar?s for bridegroom and bride; the later language, however, distinguishes the
feminine from the masculine in all these cases generally by the ending a (at). In early
Arabic also the feminine ending is commonly omitted in such participles as ??mil,
b??in (gravida), and the like, which from the nature of the case can only be used of
females. Thus also ?????, at least in Nu 11:12 (Is 49:23?), probably means nurse (for
????(cid:31)???
2 2 The Arab grammarians call this use of the masculine plural and dual (e.g. el-
abaw?ni, the two fathers, i.e. parentes) taghl?(cid:31)b or the making (the masculine)
prevail (over the feminine).—Cf. M. Grünert, Die Begriffs-Präponderanz und die
Duale a potiori im Altarab., Vienna, 1886.
3 3 The masculine gender is attributed ‘by the Hebrews and the Semites generally to
whatever is dangerous, savage, courageous, respected, great, strong, powerful …; the
feminine to whatever is motherly, productive, sustaining, nourishing, gentle, weak, …
subject, &c.’ (Albrecht, ZAW. 1896, p. 120 f.).
4 4 When, on the other hand, words with a feminine-ending, such as
(stem ???), ??? time (see the Lexicon), are sometimes construed as masculine, this is
owing probably in some cases to a misunderstanding of the formation of the word, the
? of the feminine being regarded as a radical.
5 5 Cf. a city and a mother (???) in Israel, 2 S 20:19. In the same way ??? (like µ????,
mater) on Phoenician coins stands for mother-city, µ?? ???????. The same figure is
used in such expressions as sons of Zion, Ps 149:2; sons of Babylon, Ez 23:15, &c., as
also in speaking of the suburbs of a city as its daughters, e.g. Jos 15:45 ff., &c.—The
comparison of Jerusalem to a woman is especially frequent in allegorical descriptions,
e.g. Ez 16:23, La 1:1, &c.

 a bow

??(cid:31)? ??

denote not the country but the inhabitants; so ??????? La 1:3; cf. Gn 41:8, Ex 10:7, 12:33, 1 S
17:21, 2 S 8:2, 24:9, Is 7:2, 21:2, 42:11, Jer 50:10, Jb 1:15. Hence the frequent personification
of nations (as well as of countries and towns, see h, note 5) as female beings, e.g. Is 50:1, 54:1
ff., and the use of the expressions ????? ??? Is 47:1 ff., ????? ??? &c. (see above) as collective
poetical personifications of the people.

(b) Appellative nouns, which denote a circumscribed space, such as

??????  earth,
land, ????? world, ??? ?? the abode of the dead, ????? circle (of the Jordan valley), ???? a
town, ????? a well, ????? the north, ?????? the south.

In the majority of nouns denoting place the gender is variable, e.g.

??????

 and

???????  a way

(usually feminine; the masculine gender only begins to predominate with Ezekiel; cf.
Albrecht, l. c., 1896, p. 55), ????? (???) valley, ??? garden (fem. Gn 2:15, unless ?????????, &c., is to
??????  door, 1 &c.; also ????? place, at
be read), ?????? palace, temple, ????? court,
least in Gn 18:24 (referring to Sodom), Jb 20:9, and 2 S 17:12 Keth??bh, is construed as
feminine. The mountains and hills commanding the surrounding country are almost without
exception masculine (see Albrecht, l. c., p. 60 f.).

??????  vineyard,

(c) The names of instruments, utensils, and (on the same analogy) members and

parts of the body in man or beast, since these are all regarded as subservient and
subordinate (consequently as feminine).

Thus

??????  shoe,

??????  sword, ????? tent-peg, ??? bucket, ??? cup,

??????  bed, &c.; in other cases,
as ????? chest, ark (with the article ???????), ????? oven, the gender is variable. (‘Instruments for
binding or holding, girdles and the like, as constraining and mastering, are masculine,’
Albrecht, l. c., p. 89.)—Also
c., p. 73 f.), ??????? finger (and so probably
hand,
??????  horn, ? ??
tooth; as a rule also ?????? arm (masc. Is 17:5, &c.), ????? tongue (masc. Ps 22:16, Pr 26:28, &c.),
??????

 eye (masc. Zc 3:9, &c.), ??? thigh (masc. Ex 29:27).2

 ear (and in general, members occurring in pairs, Albrecht, l.

???????  knee, ?????? thigh, ????? shoulder, ????? cheek,

 thumb, great toe), ??? and ??? hand, ?????? right

??????  belly, ????? wing,

 foot,

??????

??????

??????

(d) Certain names of natural forces or substances are feminine, being probably
regarded as instruments, while in the names of the heavens, the heavenly bodies and
natural phenomena, the masculine generally predominates (cf. Albrecht, l. c., p. 323
??????  sun (but often also masc., Ps 19:6, 104:19); ??? (Ethiopic
ff.); thus feminine are
??????  a stone, as a rule also ???? wind, spirit;
’?ât) fire (rarely masc.);
??????  breath, soul; also ??? light in Jer 13:16, Jb 36:32, and others.

 brightness,

??????

4. The following classes of ideas, which are also regarded as feminine in Hebrew

(see above, h), are usually indicated by the feminine form, notwithstanding their
occasional transference to masculine persons (see r and s):

1 1 ???????? camp is feminine only when it is a collective, denoting the persons in a
camp.
2 2 ?? nose, ???? sinew, ????? tail, ???? palate, ????? liver, ???, ????? heart, ??????, ????????? bowels,
??(cid:31)???
 back of the neck, ??? mouth, ?????? neck, ???? head, ??? ??
shoulder, also
masculine.— ??(cid:31)???

 womb, except in Jer 20:17, are invariably construed as

 forehead, ??? skin,  ?????
??(cid:31)???

 bone is common.

???

?????? ), e.g. ??????? firmness, faithfulness,

(a) Abstracts1 (sometimes along with masculine forms from the same stem, as ???????
????

vengeance, as well as ?????, ??????? help, as well as
strength, ??????? greatness, ?????? fullness, ??? ?????? dominion, &c. Similarly, the feminine (sing.
and plur.) of adjectives and participles is used substantivally in the sense of the Latin and
Greek neuter, e.g. ??????? stedfastness, Ps 5:10, ????? goodness, ????? evil, Gn 50:20, ??????? a light
thing (i.e. a trifling thing), Jer 6:14; so especially in the plural, e.g. ??????? great things, Ps
12:4; ???????????? the ruined places, Ez 36:36, along with ??? ?????? that which was desolate, ?????
kindnesses, 2 K 25:28, ??????? uprightness, honesty, Is 26:10, ???????? amoena, Ps 16:11 (but in
verse 6 in the same sense ?????????), ????????? wonderful things, Ex 34:10 and frequently, ????? hard
things, roughly Gn 42:7, 30 (but cf. also
??????  vain things, Pr 12:11, 28:19). Cf. moreover, the
very frequent use of ????, ???? (as well as ??? and ???), Ju 14:4, Ps 118:23, &c., in the sense of
 equivalent to illa, Is 51:19): also the use of the feminine form of the verb
hoc, illud (also
in Is 7:7 ???????? ????? ????? ??? it shall not stand, neither shall it come to pass; cf. Jer 10:7; so too
the suffixes Gn 15:6, Ex 10:11, Jb 38:18, referring back to a whole statement.2

??????

(b) Titles and designations of office, properly a subdivision of the abstract ideas treated
above, under q, and specially noticed here only on account of their peculiar transference to
concrete male persons. Thus we have
 Ec 1:1, &c. (as a title of Solomon), properly no
doubt that which takes part in or speaks in a religious assembly, hence LXX ????????????,
 Ezr 2:57,
i.e. concionator, preacher; the proper names
Neh 7:59, and the foreign word ????? viceroy; in the plural ?????? prop. cognomina, then like-
named, colleagues; ??????? princes (if this be the true meaning).3 All these words, in
accordance with their meaning, are construed as masculine (in Ec 7:27 instead of ?? ??????? the
words should rather be divided as ???? ????; cf. 12:8).

 Ezr 2:55, Neh 7:57, and

????????

????????

????????

Abstract ideas include also—

(c) Collectives in the fem. form,1 generally fem. participles used substantivally, especially

as the comprehensive designation of a number of persons, e.g. ???????? (fem. of travelling),
prop. the travelling (company), i.e. travelling persons (a caravan); ????? (fem. of ????? one going
into exile) the company of exiles (also frequently used of those who had returned home again);
????
 (prop. that which is
hostile) the enemy, Mi 7:8, 10 (cf. Mi 4:6 f. the halting, cast off, driven away, i.e. those who
halt, &c.); ????? (the abject) the poorest sort; of living beings which are not persons, cf. ?????
(that which lives) in the sense of cattle, beasts; ????? a shoal of fish, Gn 1:26 (but in Jon 2:2 as a

 (that which inhabits) i.e. the population, Is 12:6, Mi 1:11 f.;

????????

????

1 1 Cf. the list of masculine and feminine abstracts in Albrecht, l. c., 1896, p. 111 ff.
2 2 While in all these instances it is simplest to speak of the feminine in Hebrew as
being used for the neuter (which in Latin, Greek, and German is commonly employed
for similar purposes), it must yet not be forgotten that since the language is wholly
wanting in neuters, the Semitic mind regarded the above-mentioned forms primarily
as actual feminines. Hence the Arab commentators are accustomed to explain the
feminines of adjectives and participles (which would be neuter in Latin, &c.) by
supplying a feminine substantive.
3 3 This use of the feminine form is far more frequent in Arabic, Ethiopic, and
Aramaic; cf. e.g. in Arabic ?al?(cid:31)fa (fem. from ?al?(cid:31)f, following after, taking the
place of) in the sense of the successor or representative (of Mu?ammad), and ?all?ma
(great wisdom) as a title of learned men. Analogous to this is the Latin magistratus,
magistracy, for magistrate, and our his Majesty, Excellency, Highness, &c.
1 1 Cf. in Greek ? ?????, the cavalry (as well as ?? ???????), ? ??µ????, Hdt. 1, 80,
&c., the camel corps.

nomen unitatis, cf. t, for ??? a fish, which in verses 1 and 11 is used as the nomen unitatis). Cf.,
moreover, ??????? dead body, Is 26:19, &c. (construed as masculine), for a heap of dead
bodies.—On the collective poetic personification of a nation, by means of ??? daughter, in  ???
?????, ????? ??? (equivalent to ????? ?????) my countrymen, see above, i.

(d) Conversely the feminine form of substantives is sometimes used (as in Arabic) as a
nomen unitatis, i.e. to indicate a single example of a class which is denoted by the masculine
form; cf. ????? a fleet (1 K 9:26), ??????? a single ship (Jon 1:3 ff.);
Keth. (
plural, Ps 40:13, 69:5); ?? ?? a poem, frequently collective, ???? ?? a single song; so probably also
??????? a fig (the corresponding masculine t??n is collective in Arabic); ??? ??? ?? a lily (also ? ????);
??????? a brick (Arab. libina, but libin collective), &c.

 Qerê) a piece of venison; ??? ?? hair (coll.), ?????? ?? a single hair (Ju 20:16; in the

 hunting, game, ?????? Gn 27:3

??????

??????

(e) The feminine is also used for things without life (as being weaker or less important),
which are named from their resemblance to organic things expressed by the corresponding
masculine form; cf. ?????? side (of the body), thigh, ??????? or ??????? back part, border (of a country,
house, &c.);
??????  forehead, ??????? greaves. On a similar distinction between the masculine for
natural, and the feminine for artificial objects, see § 87 o.

Rem. The juxtaposition of the masculine and feminine from the same stem serves

sometimes to express entirety; e.g. Is 3:1 ????? ????? ??? ???? stay and staff, i.e. every kind of support
(unless we omit verse 1b as a gloss and take staff as = staff-bearer, official; the list of officials
begins in verse 2); cf. Is 16:6, Pr 8:13. For similar groupings in the case of persons, see Is
43:6, 49:22, 60:4 (sons and daughters); 49:23, Ec 2:8.

§ 123. The Representation of Plural Ideas by Means of Collectives, and by the
Repetition of Words.

Besides the plural endings treated in § 87 a–i, the language employs other means

to express a plurality of living beings or things:

(a) Certain words employed exclusively in a collective sense, while the individual

members of the class are denoted by special words (nomina unitatis, but not in the
same sense as in § 122 t).

Thus ????? cattle, oxen1 (even joined with numerals, e.g. Ex 21:37 ????? ???????? five head of
cattle), but ??? an ox; ???? small cattle, i.e. sheep and goats (µ???), cf. Jb 1:3
??????????? ?????
??
seven thousand sheep; but ? ?? a single head of small cattle (a sheep or a goat). Other more or
less common collectives are: ???? (prop. that which prowls or roams) wild beasts, ??? (perhaps
prop. tripping) a number of little children;
i.e. vegetation in general; ??? birds, fowl;
creeping things (of small creatures),

???? ??  fresh green herb, i.e. young plants,
??????  chariots or cavalcade, ????? worms,

??????  swarming things.

??????

??????  green,

(b) The collective use of substantives which at the same time serve as nomina
unitatis; thus, ???? (never in plur.) means both man (homo) and men (homines); ???? a
man (vir) and men (viri); ?????? woman and women (Ju 21:16, 1 S 21:6); ?????? a locust,

1 1 The plural form ???????? from ????? is found only in very late Hebrew, Neh 10:37
(where according to the Mantua edition, Ginsburg, &c., even
also to be read; Baer, however, has
Hitzig, ??? ???????.

), and 2 Ch 4:3. In Am 6:12 read, with

?????(cid:31)???

?????(cid:31)??

??????

??(cid:31)???

 a bird of prey and birds of prey; ????? a leaf and foliage;

 soul and souls (persons); ????? staff and staves
???? ??  a plant

but usually a swarm of locusts;
(Gn 30:37);
and plants, herbs; ??? a tree and trees (as it were foliage); ????? fruit and fruits; ??? ?? a
shrub and shrubs; in isolated instances also nouns like
servant, ????? ass, ??? ox (cf. Gn 32:6).—On the singular (especially of gentilic
names) with the article (which may, however, be omitted in poetry, cf. e.g. Ps 12:2
??????
, Pr 11:14 ?????) to include all individuals of the same species, cf. § 126 l. On the
special meaning of the plurals formed from certain collectives, see § 124 l.

??????  man-servant, ????? ?? maid-

(c) The feminine ending; see § 122 s.

(d) The repetition of single words, and even of whole groups of words, especially

to express entirety, or in a distributive sense. The following cases are more
particularly to be noticed:

1. The repetition of one or more words to express the idea of every, all, as ??? ??? Gn

????

????

?????

???? ???

39:10, &c., day by day, every day; ??? ?? ??? ?? year by year, Dt 14:22; ???? ???? every man, Ex
36:4; with ?? before each, as
 Ex 16:21 every morning (and similarly before a
???? ???
group of words, Lv 24:8), for which the distributive ?? is also used,
and with one plural ?????????? Ps 73:14, ?????????? Jb 7:18 parallel with ?????????? every moment.
Somewhat different are the instances with ?? before the second word only, e.g. ????? ??? day by
?????
day, 1 Ch 12:22; ??? ???? ??? ?? year by year, Dt 15:20, 1 S 1:7 (but in verse 3
 Nu 24:1, Ju 16:20, 20:30 f., 1 S 3:10 as at other times. Also With the two words united
????????
by means of w?w copulative, ?????? ???? Ps 87:5, or ?????? ???? Est 1:8;  ???? ???
 all generations, Dt
32:7; ????? ??? Est 3:4; cf. Est 8:9, Ezr 10:14, 1 Ch 26:13 and often (cf. Cheyne, Bampton
Lectures, 1889, p. 479, according to whom the use of the ? copulative with the second word is
especially common in Ch and Est, and therefore belongs to the later language; Driver,
Introd.6, p. 538, No. 35); sometimes (but with the exception of Ps 45:18 only in very late
passages) with a pleonastic ???? preceding, Ps 145:13, Est 2:11, 9:28, 2 Ch 11:12, &c.

 1 Ch 9:27,

),

?

2. Repetition of words in an expressly distributive sense1 (which may to some extent be

noticed in the examples under c) equivalent to one each, &c., e.g. Nu 14:34 forty days  ???
???????? ??? ???????? counting for every day a year; cf. Ez 24:6, Ex 28:34 (three words repeated);
also with the addition of ????? apart, ?????? ????? ????? every drove by itself, Gn 32:17; cf. Zc 12:12.
Most frequently with the addition of a numeral (for the simple repetition of numerals for the
same purpose, cf. § 134 q), and with the words not only in groups of two (Lv 24:8, Nu 13:2,
31:4) or three (Nu 7:11, 17:21), but even of six (Ex 26:3) or seven (Ex 25:33, 26:19, 21, 25);
in Ex 25:35 five words even three times repeated.2

3. Repetition to express an exceptional or at least superfine quality; e.g. 2 K 25:15 which
?????

were of gold, gold, of silver, silver, i.e. made of pure gold and pure silver; Dt 2:27
only along by the high way; cf. Nu 3:8, 8:16 they are given, given to him, i.e. given

???? ????

?????

1 1 Cf. in the New Testament St. Mark 6:39 f. ??µ????? ??µ?????, ??????? ???????
(Weizsäcker, tischweise, beetweise).
2 2 These repetitions of larger groups of words belong entirely to the Priestly Code in
the Pentateuch, and are unquestionably indications of a late period of the language. Of
quite a different kind are such examples as Ez 16:6, where the repetition of four words
serves to give greater solemnity to the promise, unless here, as certainly in 1:20, it is a
mere dittography; the LXX omit the repetition, in both passages.

exclusively for his service, for his very own. Also with a certain hyperbole in such examples
as 2 K 3:16 ?????? ?????? nothing but trenches; Gn 14:10 ????? ???????? ???????? all asphalt-pits.—
Repetition serves to intensify the expression to the highest degree in Ju 5:22 by reason of the
violent pransings of his string ones, Ex 8:10 (countless heaps), and Jo 4:14 (countless
multitudes); cf. also ????? ????? Ex 23:30 by little and little, very gradually; cf. §133 k.

4. Repetition with the copula to express of more than one kind; thus Dt 25:13 (Pr 20:10)

???

???? ???

????
 a weight and a weight, i.e. two kinds of weight (hence the addition great and small);
Ps 12:3 ????? ????? with two kinds of heart, i.e. with a double-dealing heart; cf. the opposite  ?????
????? ??? 1 Ch 12:33.

§ 124. The Various Uses of the Plural-form.3

1. The plural is by no means used in Hebrew solely to express a number of

individuals or separate objects, but may also denote them collectively. This use of the
plural expresses either (a) a combination of various external constituent parts (plurals
of local extension), or (b) a more or less intensive focusing of the characteristics
inherent in the idea of the stem (abstract plurals, usually rendered in English by
forms in -hood, -ness, -ship). A variety of the plurals described under (b), in which the
secondary idea of intensity or of an internal multiplication of the idea of the stem may
be clearly seen, is (c) the pluralis excellentiae or pluralis maiestatis.

Examples of (a): Plurals of local extension to denote localities in general, but especially

??

?? ??????
??????

????????  the place at the head, ????????? place at the feet; ???????? place on the other side (of a

 (§ 88 d) heaven (cf. also ????????
 water; ?????? (the broad surface of

level surfaces (the surface-plural), since in them the idea of a whole composed of
innumerable separate parts or points is most evident, as
heights of heaven, Is 33:16, Jb 16:19; elsewhere  ?????
);
the sea) poetically for ??? sea; ?????? (prop. the side turned towards any one, then) surface in
general, usually face; ???????? the back, Ex 26:12, 33:23, &c., ????????? neck nape of the neck1;
also
river); ??????????? depth, ?????????? (also ???????) distance, ?????? ???? bed, Gn 49:4 (unless, with
Dillmann, it is to be explained in the sense of double bed, i.e. torus), ?????? ???? Ps 46:5, and
????? ???? 43:3, 84:2, 132:5, dwelling (perhaps also ????????? encampment, in passages like 1 S
4:10). The last four belong, however, to poetic style, and are better reckoned amongst the
plurals of amplification treated under d–f. So perhaps ???????? bed (Ps 63:7, Jb 17:13; but Gn
49:4, Ps 132:3, &c., in the singular); probably, however, ???????? (prop. strata) refers to a
number of coverings or pillows.

The plural of extension is used to denote a lengthened period of time in ????????? eternity

(everlasting ages).

Rem. The plural of extension includes also a few examples which were formerly
explained as simply poetic plurals, e.g. Jb 17:1 ??? ???????? graves are (ready) for me, i.e. the

3 3 Cf. Dietrich, ‘Über Begriff und Form des hebr. Plurals, ’ in the Abhandl. zur hebr.
Grammatik, Leipzig, 1846, p. 2 ff.
1 1Cf. the same use of the plural in ?? ??????, ?? ????, ?? ???????, praecordia,
cervices, fauces; on plurals of extension in general, cf. the prepositions of place and
time in the plur. form, § 103 n. ???????? is not a case in point, in the sense of letter
(properly a sheet folded into several pages; elsewhere also
10:1, 19:14 (Is 37:14; referred to afterwards by the singular suffix); Is 39:1, Jer 29:25,
).
32:14 (after being folded, previously

) 1 K 21:8 ff., 2 K

??(cid:31)???

??(cid:31)???

place where there are many of them (as it were the graveyard) is my portion, Jb 21:32, 2 Ch
16:14; cf. 2 K 22:20.

Of (b): the tolerably numerous abstract plurals, mostly of a particular form (qe?ûl??m,
qi??ûl??m, &c.), may be divided into two classes. They sum up either the conditions or qualities
inherent in the idea of the stem, or else the various single acts of which an action is
composed. Cf. for the first class, ???????? and ??????? youth, ???????? old age, ???????? youth; ????????
maidenhood, ??????? bridal state; ???????? condition of a sojourner, ???? ???? fleshliness (only in Pr
14:30), ?????? life (the abstract idea of the qualities of a living being); ?????? ?? childlessness,
?????????? blindness, ???????? perverseness.

There are also a number of plurals, found almost exclusively in poetry (sometimes along

with the singular), which are evidently intended to intensify2 the idea of the stem (plural of
amplification), as ?????? might, Is 40:26; ???????? (as well as ???????) and ??????? faithfulness; ??? ???
(according to § 93 l, only in the construct state plural or with suffixes = the happiness of),
happy; ??? ????? (complete) prosperity, Ps 68:7; ?????? Is 27:11 and ??????? Is 40:14, &c. (keen)
understanding; ????? (true) counsel, Dt 32:28; ?????? Jb 37:16 and ????? 1 S 2:3 (thorough)
knowledge; ??????? Jb 12:6 and ?????????? Is 32:18 (full) confidence; ??????? (abundant) blessing, Ps
21:7; ??????? (exceptional) strength, Jb 41:4; ????? Ps 5:10 (very) wickedness;  ??????
 Dn 9:23
(greatly) beloved; ????? Ps 76:11, &c.(fierce) wrath; ??????? Dn 12:2 (utter) contempt; ??? ????
(real) help, Is 26:18, &c.; ??????? Gn 46:2 (an important) vision; ???? ?????? uprightness; ?????????
perversity; ??????? (complete) vengeance, Ju 11:36, &c.; ???? ???? and ???? ??????? (thick) darkness;
?????????? a (close) hiding-place; ????????? nobility; ?????? ?? Is 28:1 fatness; ????????? (complete) aridity;
?????????? sweetness; ??????????? preciousness; ???? ????? ?? delight;
compassion; ??????? Ps 23:2 rest, refreshment; ??????? Am 3:9 tumult. Probably also ????????
(heartfelt) love, Ps 45:1; ??????? (extreme) bitterness, Jb 13:26; ??????? (base) deceit, Ps 38:13;
??????? (true) righteousness, Is 33:15, &c.; ????? ?? (the highest) joy, Ps 16:11. On the other hand,
??????? wisdom (Pr 1:20, &c.) can hardly be a plural (=the essence of wisdom, or wisdom
personified), but is a singular (see § 86 l).

 and ??????????? pleasure; ?????????

????????

?

A further extension of this plural of amplification occurs according to P. Haupt’s very
probable suggestion (SBOT. Proverbs, p. 40, line 50, &c.) in ???????? the great river (of the
Nile, generally ?????) Is 7:18, 19:6 (though with the predicate in the plural), Ez 30:12, Ps
78:44, but in Is 37:25, Ez 29:3 the usual explanation, arms or channels of the Nile, can hardly
be avoided; also in ??????? Ps 24:2 of the ocean, which encircles the earth, 137:1 of the great
river, i.e. the Euphrates, but in Is 18:1 ??? ???????? is evidently a numerical plural.—In Pr 16:13
???????? (acc. to P. Haupt=the great king) is very doubtful. In ???? ???? Ez 19:1 the second yôdh is
evidently due to dittography, since ????? ??? follows.

The summing up of the several parts of an action is expressed in ???????? embalming, ????????
atonement, ???????? (prop. filling, sc. of the hand) ordination to the priesthood, ?????? ?? dismissal,
?????? ?? retribution, ???????? engraving (of a seal, &c.); ???????? fornication, ???????? whoredom, ?????????
adultery;
Jb 7:4 (restless) tossing to and fro, ???????? wonder La 1:9, ?????? gleaning; perhaps also ????????? Ps
4:1, 6:1, &c., if it means the playing on stringed instruments, and ???????? ?? Is 1:23 bribery,
unless it be a plural of number.1

 (prop. no doubt, warm compassion) consolation, ?????????? supplication, ????????

???????

??

2 2 Cf. A. Ember, ‘The pluralis intensivus in Hebrew,’ AJSL. 1905, p. 195 ff.
SBOT. SBOT. = Sacred Books of the Old Testament, ed. by P. Haupt. Lpz. and
Baltimore, 1893 ff.
1 1 Mayer Lambert in REJ. xxiv. 106 ff., enumerates no less than ninety-five words
ending in ?(cid:31)m, which in his opinion are to be regarded as pluralia tantum.

Of (c): the pluralis excellentiae or maiestatis, as has been remarked above, is properly a

variety of the abstract plural, since it sums up the several characteristics2 belonging to the
idea, besides possessing the secondary sense of an intensification of the original idea. It is
thus closely related to the plurals of amplification, treated under e, which are mostly found in
poetry. So especially ???????? Godhead, God (to be distinguished from the numerical plural
gods, Ex 12:12, &c.). The supposition that ???????? is to be regarded as merely a remnant of
earlier polytheistic views (i.e. as originally only a numerical plural) is at least highly
improbable, and, moreover, would not explain the analogous plurals (see below). That the
language has entirely rejected the idea of numerical plurality in ???????? (whenever it denotes
one God), is proved especially by its being almost invariably joined with a singular attribute
(cf. § 132 h), e.g. ?????? ???????? Ps 7:10, &c. Hence ???????? may have been used originally not
only as a numerical but also as an abstract plural (corresponding to the Latin numen, and our
Godhead), and, like other abstracts of the same kind, have been transferred to a concrete
single god (even of the heathen).

To the same class (and probably formed on the analogy of ????????) belong the plurals
?? ????? the Most Holy (only of Yahweh), Ho 12:1, Pr 9:10, 30:3 (cf. ?? ????? ???????? Jos 24:19,
and the Aram. ?????????? the Most High, Dn 7:18, 22, 25); and probably ???????? (usually taken in
the sense of penates) the image of a god, used especially for obtaining oracles. Certainly in 1
S 19:13, 16 only one image is intended; in most other places a single image may be intended1;
in Zc 10:2 alone is it most naturally taken as a numerical plural. In Ec 5:7 ???????? supremus (of
God) is doubtful; according to others it is a numerical plural, superiores.

Further, ????????, as well as the singular ????, (lordship) lord, e.g. ? ???? ???????? a cruel lord, Is

????

 the lord of the land, Gn 42:30, cf. Gn 32:19; so especially with the suffixes
 Ps 45:12, ????????, &c., also

19:4;
??? ???????
of the 2nd and 3rd persons
but in 1st sing. always ???????.2 So also ???????? (with suffixes) lord, master (of slaves, cattle, or
inanimate things; but in the sense of maritus, always in the singular), e.g. ???????? Ex 21:29, Is
1:3, &c.3

 (except 1 S 16:16);

??????
?

??????

????

?????

???

,

On the other hand, we must regard as doubtful a number of participles in the plural,
which, being used as attributes of God, resemble plurales excellentiae; thus, ?? ??? my Maker,
 Is 54:5; ??? ??? Ps 149:2; ???? ??? Is 22:11; ????????? stretching them out, Is 42:5; for
Jb 35:10;

? ???

?????

2 2 The Jewish grammarians call such plurals ??????? ????? plur. virium or virtutum; later
grammarians call them plur. excellentiae, magnitudinis, or plur. maiestaticus. This
last name may have been suggested by the we used by kings when speaking of
themselves (cf. already 1 Macc. 10:19, 11:31); and the plural used by God in Gn 1:26,
11:7, Is 6:8 has been incorrectly explained in this way. It is, however, either
communicative (including the attendant angels; so at all events in Is 6:8, cf. also Gn
3:22), or according to others, an indication of the fullness of power and might implied
in ???????? (see Dillmann on Gn 1:26); but it is best explained as a plural of self-
deliberation. The use of the plural as a form of respectful address is quite foreign to
Hebrew.
1 1 Even in Gn 31:34, notwithstanding the plural suffix in ??? ?????? and ????????, since the
construction of these abstracts as numerical plurals is one of the peculiarities of the E-
document of the Hexateuch; cf. Gn 20:13, 35:7, and § 145 i.
2 2 On
?????  (for ???????) as a name of God, cf. § 135 q.
3 3 Euting, Reise in Arabien, p. 61, mentions the interesting fact that the subjects of
the Emir of ?âyel commonly speak of their ruler as šiyûkh, a plur. majestatis= the
great sheikh.

??

all these forms may also be explained as singular, according to § 93 ss.4—?? ??????? Is 3:12 might
also be regarded as another instance, unless it be a numerical plural, their oppressors;
moreover, ????????? him who lifteth it up, Is 10:15 (but read probably
sendeth him, Pr 10:26, 22:21 (so Baer, but Ginsburg
????????). These latter plurals, however (including ??????), may probably be more simply
explained as indicating an indefinite individual, cf. o below.—For
receptus) and

 Ec 12:1 (textus receptus) the singular should be read, with Baer.

 Ps 121:5 (textus

????

??????  silver,

????? ??  brass, ????? milk,

Rem. 1. (a) Coherent substances, &c., are mostly regarded as single, and are, accordingly,
??????  ashes, ??? linen, ??????

almost always represented by nouns in the singular, cf. ???? fine dust,
lead, ????? gold,
??????  wine, ????? dust, the ground, ??? wood.
Plurals are, however, formed from some of these words expressing materials in order to
denote separate portions taken from the whole in manufacture (plurals of the result) or parts
otherwise detached from it; thus, ?????? linen garments; ???????? silver pieces, Gn 42:25, 35;
????
 (dual) fetters of brass; ?????? ligna (timber for building or sticks for burning); also in a
wider sense, ????????? particles of alloy to be separated by smelting, Is 1:25; ??????? fragments of
earth, Pr 8:26, cf. Jb 28:6 ????? ??????? dust of gold.

?? ??????

(b) To the class of plurals of the result belong also a few names of natural products, when

represented in an artificial condition; thus, ?????? wheat in grain (threshed wheat), as
distinguished from ????? wheat (used collectively) in the ear; cf. the same distinction between
????  and
????
?????? ?? and ????? ?? barley; also ???? ???? linen,

 spelt; ?? ?????? and ? ?????? (the singular preserved only in the Mishna) lentils;

???? ??  (to be inferred from ??? ????) flax.

????(cid:31)???

(c) Finally, the distinction between ??? blood and ?????? requires to be specially noticed. The

singular is always used when the blood is regarded as an organic unity, hence also of
menstrual blood, and the blood of sacrifices (collected in the basin and then sprinkled), and in
Nu 23:24 of the blood gushing from wounds. On the other hand, ?????? as a sort of plural of the
result and at the same time of local extension, denotes blood which is shed, when it appears as
blood-stains (Is 1:15) or as blood-marks (so evidently in Is 9:4). But since blood-stains or
blood-marks, as a rule, suggest blood shed in murder (although ?????? also denotes the blood
which flows at child-birth or in circumcision), ?????? acquired (even in very early passages)
simply the sense of a bloody deed, and especially of bloodguiltiness, Ex 22:1 f., &c.

???? ??????

In some few cases the plural is used to denote an indefinite singular; certainly so in Dt
????

17:5
 (where
 unto one of thy gates; Zc 9:9 ??????????? (cf. Ct 2:9); Ex 21:22
evidently only one child is thought of, certainly though in connexion with a contingency
which may be repeated); cf. also Ec 4:10 (if one of them fall).—So probably also Gn 8:4, 1 S
17:43, Dn 2:1, Neh 3:8, 6:2; but not Gn 19:29, since the same document (Gn 13:12) makes
Lot dwell in the cities of the Jordan valley; in Gn 21:7 ?????? denotes the class with which the
action is concerned. In Ju 12:7 instead of the unusual ??????? ??????? in the cities of Gilead
(formerly explained here as in one of the cities of Gilead) we should most probably read, with
Moore (SBOT. Judges, p. 52), ??????? ????????? ??????? in his city, in Mizpeh (in) Gilead.

??????

????

2. When a substantive is followed by a genitive, and the compound idea thus

formed is to be expressed in the plural, this is done—

???????(cid:31)????

4 4
merely formed on analogy.

, which in Is 54:5 is in parallelism with

? ???(cid:31)????

, must then be explained as

(a) Most naturally by using the plural of the nomen regens, e.g.

 mighty
men of valour (prop. heroes of strength), 1 Ch 7:2, 9; so also in compounds, e.g.  ?????
???????? 1 S 22:7, as the plur. of ???????????? Benjamite; but also

?? ???????

????

(b) By using the plural of both nouns,1 e.g. ???????? ??????? 1 Ch 7:5; ???????? ????????? and in

????

?? ?????

prison houses, Is 42:22; cf. Ex 34:1, &c., ???????? ?????????? ?? two tables of stone (but Ex
31:18
Ezr 3:3, &c. ?????????? ????? the people of the country; 2 Ch 26:14; so perhaps ?????? ?????
sons of God, Ps 29:1, 89:7 (according to others sons of gods); or finally even

); Nu 13:32, Dt 1:28, Jos 5:2, 6:4, 2 K 14:14, 25:23, Is 51:9, Jer 41:16,

(c) By using the plural of the nomen rectum; 1 e.g. ???? ???? Ex 6:14, Nu 1:2, 4 ff.,
&c., as plur. of ?? ???? father’s house, family; ??????? ???? the houses of the high places, 2
K 17:29 (also ??????? ?????? 23:19); ?????????? ???? the houses of their idols, 1 S 31:9, Ez
46:24; cf. also Ju 7:25 the head of Oreb and Zeeb, i.e. the heads, &c.

Rem. When a substantive (in a distributive sense) with a suffix refers back to a plural, the

singular form of the substantive suffices, since the idea of plurality is already adequately
expressed by the suffix, e.g. ????? os (for ora) eorum, Ps 17:10; ???????? their right hand, Ps 144:8
[so in the English RV.], for hands.

§ 125. Determination of Nouns in general. Determination of Proper Names.

Brockelmann, Grundriss, i. 466 ff.

1. A noun may either be determinate in itself, as a proper name or pronoun (see
below, d and i), or be made so by its context. In the latter case, the determination may
be effected either by prefixing the article (see § 126), or by the connexion of the noun
(in the construct state) with a following determinate genitive, and consequently also
(according to § 33 c) by its union with a pronominal suffix (§ 127 a). It is to be taken
as a fundamental rule, that the determination can only be effected in one of the ways
here mentioned; the article cannot be prefixed to a proper name, nor to a noun
followed by the genitive, nor can a proper name be used in the construct state.
Deviations from this rule are either only apparent or have arisen from a corruption of
the text.

Rem. Only in a few passages is a noun made expressly indeterminate by the addition of

????? in the sense of our indefinite article; cf. Ex 16:33, Ju 9:53, 13:2, 1 S 1:1, 7:9, 12, 1 K
13:11, 19:4, 20:13, 22:9, 2 K 4:1, 8:6, 12:10, Ez 8:8, Dn 8:3, 10:5 (in 8:13 ????? ????? i.e. one,
viz. a holy one, is opposed to another).

It is further to be noticed, that in Hebrew the phenomenon sometimes occurs, which the

????

??????????

Arab grammarians call indeterminateness for the sake of amplification; e.g. Is 31:8 and he
shall flee
 from a sword, i.e. from an irresistible sword (God’s sword); cf. Is 28:2 ?????;
2 S 6:2 ? ??; Ho 3:1 ?????? such a woman, without doubt to be referred to the Gomer mentioned
in cap. 1; Am 6:14 ???; Ps 77:16 ????????; Pr 21:12 ??????, if with Delitzsch it is to be referred to
God; Jb 8:10 ?????? meaning important words, but in 15:13 ?????? reproachful words. Cf. on this
point, § 117 q, note 3, and Delitzsch, Psalmen, ed. 4, p. 79.

1 1 Cf. König, Lehrgebäude, ii. 438 f., according to whom the plural of the principal
word exercises an influence on the determining genitive.
1 1 Cf. Brockelmann, Grundriss, i. 482.

????????

2. Real proper nouns, as being the names of things (or persons) only once met
with, are sufficiently determinate in themselves. Such names, therefore, as ????, ?????,
, ????? do not admit of the article,1 nor can they be in the construct state. On
????????,
the other hand, not only gentilic names (as denoting the various individuals belonging
to the same class), but also all those proper names, of which the appellative sense is
still sufficiently evident to the mind, or at least has been handed down from an earlier
period of the language, frequently (often even as a rule) take the article (according to
§ 126 e), and may even be followed by a genitive.

??

Examples. Like the above-mentioned proper names of individuals, countries, and cities,
so also national names, which are identical in form with the name of the founder of the race
????? ?? , ?????, ????), are always determinate in themselves. Of gentilic names (e.g. ??????????
(e.g.
the Hebrew, ??????????? the Hebrews, Gn 40:15; ???????????? the Canaanite) the plural ???? ??????, even
when meaning the Philistines, is generally used without the article (but in 1 S 4:7, &c., ?????);
so always ??????????.—Evident appellatives (like such modern names as the Hague, le Havre)
are ????????? the hill, in the construct state ??? ?? ???????, i.e. the Gibeah named after Saul to
distinguish it from others; ???????? the height; ????? the heap; ????????? (prop. the white mountain) the
Lebanon; ??????? (prop. the river) the Nile, cf. Am 8:8 ?????????? ?????? like the river of Egypt; ?????????
the Jordan (according to Seybold, Mittheil. und Nachr. des DPV., 1896, p. 11, probably the
drinking-place [???, Arab. warada, meaning orig. to go down to drink]).

Rem. 1. In a few instances original appellatives have completely assumed the character of

real proper names, and are therefore used without the article; thus ???????? God, to denote the
one true God (as elsewhere ????) Gn 1:1 and so generally in this document of the Pentateuch
up to Ex 6, elsewhere sometimes ??????????? ? ???? (cf. § 126 e); also the sing. ?????? God, ???????
the Most High, and ??? ?? the Almighty never take the article.—Moreover, ???? Adam from Gn
5:1 onwards (previously in 2:7, &c., ??????? the first man); ??? ?? Satan, 1 Ch 21:1 (but Zc 3:1, Jb
1:6, &c., ???????? the adversary); cf. ????? ????? the tent of revelation (i.e. the tabernacle), always
without the article.

To the class of nouns originally appellative, which the language regards as proper names,
and which consequently never take the article, belong also certain archaic words mostly used
only by poets, such as ??? ?? Hades, ????? world, ????? ocean, of the body of water which
encircles the earth, Gn 1:2, &c.; but Is 63:13, Ps 106:9 ????????? through the depths, viz. of the
Red Sea.1

2. When nouns which the usage of the language always treats as proper names
occasionally appear to be connected with a following genitive, this is really owing to an
ellipse whereby the noun which really governs the genitive, i.e. the appellative idea contained
in the proper name, is suppressed. So evidently in the case of ??????? ??????? Yahweh (the God) of

1 1 Consequently, ??????????? Dt 3:13, Jos 1:12, &c. (in the Deuteronomist) in the
combination ??????????? ??? ?? (for which elsewhere ???????? ??? ??) is to be regarded not as a
proper name but as a gentilic name (= the tribe of the Manassites), for which in Dt
29:7 ??????????? ?? is used, as in 10:8 ??????? ?? the tribe of the Levites, and in Ju 18:1 ??????? ???
the tribe of the Danites.—In Jos 13:7 ??????????? (like gentilic names in ? ??) is even used
adjectivally.
1 1 That various other words, such as ????? man,
field, ??? ????? effectual working, are always found without the article is not to be
attributed to any special archaism, but is to be explained from the fact that they belong
solely to poetic language, which avoids the article; in other cases, such as ????????? deep
sleep, there is no occasion for the article in the passages we possess.

 deep darkness, ????? prince, ??? ??

??????(cid:31)???

????

??????? ?????

 Aram (the region) of the two rivers;

hosts; the fuller form ??????? ??????? ???? 2 S 5:10, &c., or ????????? ??????? ???? Am 3:13, &c., is a
secondary expansion of the original ??????? ???????; ??????? ???????? in Ps 59:6, 80:15, 20, 84:9 is due
to the mechanical substitution of ???????? for ???? affected in the 2nd and part of the 3rd book of
the Psalms. So also in geographical names such as ???? ???? ??? Ur (the city) of the Chaldees, Gn
11:28;
Judah; ???????? ???? ???? 2 S 20:14, &c., to distinguish it from
16:4; ??????? ?????? 1 S 11:1, &c.; ?????? ??????? Nu 22:1, 26:3, 63, &c.; on Ju 8:32 cf. § 128 c;  ?????? ?????
????? ???? the Zion of the Holy One of Israel, Is 60:14; but in 1 S 1:1 for ?????? read ????? a Zuphite.
Some of these examples (cf. also Am 6:2) come very near to the actual construct state (cf.
above, ??? ?? ???????), since e.g. the addition of the genitive serves to distinguish the place from
four others called Aram (see the Lexicon), or from another Bethlehem. Aram, Bethlehem,
&c., are accordingly no longer names found only in one special sense, and therefore also are
no longer proper names in the strictest sense.

3. Of the pronouns, the personal pronouns proper (the separate pronouns, § 32) are
always determinate in themselves, since they can denote only definite individuals (the
3rd person, also definite things). For the same reason the demonstrative pronouns (§
34) are also determinate in themselves, when they stand alone (as equivalent to
substantives), either as subject (Gn 5:29) or as predicate (e.g. ????? ??? this is the day, Ju
?????????? ???  these are the words, Dt 1:1), or as object (e.g. ???????? 2 S 13:17), or
4:14;
as genitive (??? ?????? 1 K 21:2), or finally when joined to a preposition (?????? Gn 2:23;
????? 1 S 16:8, see § 102 g).

???

So also the personal pronouns ???, ????, ???,

?????? ,

??????

 when they are used as

demonstratives (=is, ea, id, ille, &c.) are always determinate in themselves, e.g.  ???
??????? that is the thing, Gn 41:28. They are made determinate by the article, when they
are joined like adjectives (see § 126 u) with a determinate substantive, e.g. ????? ??????
this man;
?????? ?????? ???
time, Jo 4:1. The demonstrative, however, even in this case, is frequently used without
the article, as being sufficiently determinate in itself (cf. § 126 y).

§ 126. Determination by Means of the Article.

1. The article ( ??· , ??, ??, § 35) was originally, as in other languages (clearly in the
Romance; cf. also ?, ?, ?? in Homer), a demonstrative pronoun. The demonstrative
force of the article, apart from its occasional use as a relative pronoun (see § 138 i),
appears now, however, only (a) in a few standing phrases, and (b) in a certain class of
statements or exclamations.

(a) Cf. ????? this day, hodie (§ 100 c.);

??????????

 this night, Gn 19:34;

????????

 this time, Gn 2:23;

???????? this year (= in this year) Is 37:30, Jer 28:16.

(b) includes those instances in which the article, mostly when prefixed to a participle,
joins on a new statement concerning a preceding noun. Although such participles, &c., are no
doubt primarily regarded always as in apposition to a preceding substantive, the article
nevertheless has in some of these examples almost the force of ??? (????,
?????? ) as the subject of
a noun-clause; e.g. Ps 19:10 the judgements of the Lord are true …, verse 11 ??? ????????????? prop.
the more to be desired than gold, i.e. they are more to be desired, or even they, that are more

to be desired, 1 &c.; cf. Gn 49:21, Is 40:22 f., 44:27 f., 46:6, Am 2:7, 5:7, Ps 33:15, 49:7
(??????????? in the parallel half of the verse continued by a finite verb); Ps 104:3, Jb 6:16, 28:4,
30:3, 41:25 and frequently. When such a participle has another co-ordinate with it, the latter is
used without the article, since according to the above it strictly speaking represents a second
predicate, and as such, according to i, remains indeterminate; e.g. Jb 5:10 who giveth (???????)
rain, &c. and sendeth ???????? &c.

The article is sometimes used with similar emphasis before a substantive, which serves as

the subject of a compound sentence (§ 140 d); e.g. Dt 32:4 ??????? ?????? ????? i.e. as a fresh
statement (not in apposition to the preceding dative), really equivalent to he is a rock, perfect
in his work (i.e. whose work is perfect); cf. Ps 18:31.

2. The article is, generally speaking, employed to determine a substantive

wherever it is required by Greek and English; thus:

(a) When a person or thing already spoken of is mentioned again, and is

consequently more definite to the mind of the hearer or reader; e.g. Gn 1:3 and God
said, Let there be light: verse 4 and God saw the light (?????????); 1 K 3:24 fetch me a
sword: and they brought the sword; Ec 9:15. (In 2 S 12:2 therefore ?? ??????? must be
read.)

(b) With a title understood and recognized by every one, e.g.

????? ?? ????

?????

 ?

???????? ????µ??: Gn 35:8 under the oak (the well-known oak which was there).

(c) With appellatives to denote persons or natural objects which are unique, e.g.
???????

??????? ??????? the high priest,

 the earth.

 the sun,

????

?????

(d) When terms applying to whole classes are restricted (simply by usage) to
particular individuals (like ? ???????, meaning Homer) or things, e.g. ??? ?? adversary,
 Baal as proper name of the god; ??????? the
???????? the adversary, Satan;
(first) man, Adam; ??????????1 or ????? ? ????, the one true God (cf. also ? ??????? in the
New Testament); also ??????? the river, i.e. Euphrates; ??????? the circle, sc. of the Jordan,
the Jordan plain [Gn 19:17, &c.].

??????  lord,

????????

(e) Very often with the vocative, e.g. 2 S 14:4

 help, O king; Zc 3:8
??????? ??????? ?? ?????? O Joshua the high priest; 1 S 17:58, 24:9, 2 K 9:5; in the plural, Is
42:18, Jo 1:2, 13; but cf. also Jos 10:12, Is 1:2, 49:13 (
13:14, Jo 1:5, Ps 34:12, Ec 10:17, 11:9, &c.2 The vocative occurs without the article
in Is 22:2, since it has been already defined by a preceding accusative.

?????? ); 23:16, Ho

?? ??????

???? ???

 and

?????

?????

Rem. Strictly speaking in all these cases the substantive with the article is really in
apposition to the personal pronoun of the 2nd person, which is either expressly mentioned or
virtually present (in the imperative), e.g. 1 S 17:58 thou, the young man. But such passages as

1 1 On the analogous use of the article before participles which have a verbal suffix,
as in Ps 18:33, &c., cf. above, § 116 f.
1 1 On the subsequent change of ??? ??, ????, ???????? into real proper names by the
omission of the article, cf. above, § 125 f.
2 2 For further exceptions see Nestle, ZAW. 1904, p. 323 ff.

Is 42:18, where the vocative precedes the imperative, prove that in such cases the substantive
originally in apposition eventually acquired the value of a complete clause.

(f) With words denoting classes (see particulars under l).

(g) In a peculiar way, to specify persons or things, which are so far definite as to

be naturally thought of in connexion with a given case, and must be assumed
accordingly to be there (see q–s).

(h) With adjectives (also ordinal numbers and demonstrative pronouns used
adjectivally) which are joined to substantives determined in some way (see u).

Rem. The article may be omitted in poetry in all the above-mentioned cases; in general it
is used in poetry far less frequently than in prose. Its use or omission probably often rests on
rhythmical grounds;3 it is sometimes omitted also for rhetorical reasons. Cf. e.g.
???????
 21:2; ??????? ????? ???? ?? (contrary to u, v) 99:3. In
?????????
???????  for
Ps 2:2; ???????? as vocative, verse 10;
the instances in which the ? of the article is omitted after a prefix (§ 35 n), the vowel of the
article is often retained after the prefix even in poetry, e.g.

 Ps 2:4, &c.

??????  for

???????

????

(i) On the other hand, the article is always omitted when a person or thing is to be
represented as indefinite (or indefinable) or as yet unknown; consequently also before
the predicate, since this is from its nature always a general term, under which the
subject is included, e.g. Gn 29:7 ????? ????? ??? as yet the day is great, i.e. it is yet high
day; 33:13, 40:18, 41:26, Is 66:3.

Rem. 1. As exceptions to the above rule it is usual to regard those examples in which a

determinate adjective or participle (equivalent to a relative clause) is used apparently as a
predicate, e.g. Gn 2:11 ??????? ??? it is the compassing, i.e. that is it which compasseth; 42:6,
45:12, Ex 9:27, Dt 3:21, 8:18, 11:7, 1 S 4:16, Is 14:27, Mal 3:2 (cf. in Greek, e.g. St. Mat.
10:20, where Winer, Gram. des neutest. Sprachidioms, § 58, 2, Rem., explains ?? ?????????
as a predicate with the article). In reality, however, these supposed predicates are rather
subjects (acc. to § 116 q), and the only peculiarity of these cases is that the subject is not
included under a general idea, but is equated with the predicate.

2. Sometimes the article is used with only one of two parallel words, as Na 1:5 ?????? and

?????????, 2 Ch 3:17 ???????? and ?????????????.

3. The use of the article to determine the class is more extensive in Hebrew than
in most other languages. In this case the article indicates universally known, closely
circumscribed, and therefore well defined classes of persons or things. The special
cases to be considered are—

(a) The employment of general names as collectives in the singular, to denote the sum

total of individuals belonging to the class (which may, however, be done just as well by the
plural); e.g. the righteous, the wicked man, Ec 3:17; the woman, i.e. the female sex, 7:26;
???????? the enemy, i.e. the enemies (?) Ps 9:7; ???????? the liers in wait, i.e the liers in wait;

3 3 Cf. the useful statistics of J. Ley in the Neue Jahrbücher für Philologie und
Pädagogik, 2te Abteilung, 1891, Heft 7–9, and M. Lambert, ‘ L’article dans la
po&ésie hébr., ’ REJ. 37, 263 ff.

???????? the armed man, i.e. soldiers; ????????? the rearguard; ???? ?????? the spoiler, 1 S 13:17; 1 so
also (as in English) with names of animals, when something is asserted of them, which
applies to the whole species, e.g. 2 S 17:10 as the courage of ????????? the lion. Especially also
with gentilic names, e.g. the Canaanite, Gn 13:7 (cf.1519 f.); so in English the Russian, the
Turk, &c., in Attic writers ? ????????, ? ??????????, &c.

(b) Names of materials known everywhere, the elements and other words denoting
classes, even though only a part and not the whole of them is considered, in which case in
other languages, as e.g. in English, the article is usually omitted (cf., however, our to fall into
the water, into the fire, &c.), e.g. Gn 13:2 and Abram was very rich
???????? ??????? ???????  in cattle,
in silver and in gold; Jos 11:9 and he burnt their chariots ????? with fire; cf. Gn 6:14, 41:42
(unless this means, the chain necessarily belonging to the official dress); Ex 2:3, 3:14 (3532),
??????  with oil2 very commonly in the sacrificial laws, Ex 29:2, &c., and also
Is 1:22, &c, and
Dt 33:24, 2 S 1:21, Is 1:6, Ps 23:5, &c. Similarly the article is used with terms of
 Ex 16:22;
measurement, as ???????? Ex 16:36, &c.: ??????? and ????? Ez 45:11;

 2 S 8:2.

(c) The expression of abstract ideas of every kind, since they are likewise used to
represent whole classes of attributes or states, physical or moral defects, &c.; e.g. Pr 25:5
(

????
????????
Is 60:2 the article is no doubt due to dittography of the ?, and the parallel ?????????? has no article.

); Gn 19:11 and they smote the men …

????????

(d) Comparisons, since the object compared is treated not (as usually in English)

individually but as a general term, e.g. Is 1:18 white
 as wool; red ???????
like crimson; Is 34:4 and the heavens shall be rolled together ??????? as a scroll; cf. Nu 11:12,
Ju 8:18, 16:9 as ???????????????? a string of tow is broken; 1 S 26:20, 1 K 14:15, Is 10:14, 24:20,
27:10, 29:8, 53:6, Na 3:15, Ps 33:7, 49:15; cf. also such examples as Gn 19:28, Ju 14:6, where
the object compared is determined by a determinate genitive which follows (according to §
127 a).

 as snow,

????????

?????

????

Examples of indeterminate comparisons are rare, and perhaps due only to the Masora,—
so at least in the case of singulars, while in such plurals as those in Gn 42:30, 1 K 10:27, Jo
2:4, 7, the omission of the article may be explained by the ordinary rules. On the other hand,
the article is regularly omitted when the object compared is already defined by means of an
attribute (or relative clause, Jer 23:9, Ps 17:12), e.g. Is 16:2 ??? ???? ??? ????? ????? as wandering
birds, (as) a scattered nest (but cf. 10:14 ?????); 14:19, 29:5 ????? ????? (but Ps 1:4 ?????); Jer
2:30, Pr 27:8, Jb 29:25, 30:14.—In comparisons with persons also the Masora seems to avoid
the use of the article, as in ??????? Jb 16:14 and seven other places (??????? only in Is 42:13), ????
Jb 31:18,

 Jb 38:3, 40:7.

????????

4. Peculiar to Hebrew1 is the employment of the article to denote a single person
or thing (primarily one which is as yet unknown, and therefore not capable of being

1 1 But in Ex 12:23 ??? is either to be explained as the destroyer (now mentioned for
the first time) according to q, or a particular angel is meant whose regular function it
was to inflict punishments. Others again take ??? even in Ex 12:23 impersonally =
destruction.
2 2 In nearly all the above examples the presence of the article is only indicated by the
vowel of the prefix (??, ??  , ??) and might therefore be merely due to the masoretic
punctuation. There is, however, no reason to doubt the correctness of the tradition.
The same is true of the examples under n and o.
1 1 Cf., however, analogous examples in biblical Aramaic in Kautzsch’s Gramm. des
Bibl. Aram., 79 f, e.g. Dn 2:14, 3:2, &c.

defined) as being present to the mind under given circumstances. In such cases in
English the indefinite article is mostly used.

Thus Am 5:19 as if a man did flee from a lion (????????, i.e. the particular lion pursuing him
at the time), and a bear (?????) met him, &c., cf. 3:12, 1 K 20:36 (John 10:12); also Gn 8:7 f.,
14:13 (????????, i.e. one that had escaped, the particular one who came just then; so also Ez
24:26, 33:21; cf. 2 S 15:13); Gn 15:1, 11 18:7 the servant, who is regarded as being
constantly at hand and awaiting his commands; cf. 2 S 17:17 (but
???????? above); Gn 19:30, unless ????????? means in the well-known cave; ??????? Gn 28:11,
according to Dillmann, upon the place suitable for passing the night, or the right place, but it
may possibly also refer to the sanctuary of Bethel afterwards so sacred and celebrated; Gn
42:23, 46:2, 50:26, Ex 2:15, 3:2, 4:20, 21:20 (2 S 23:21), Lv 23:42, 24:10 (Samaritan ??????? ????
without the article); Nu 17:11, 21:6, 9, 25:6, Dt 19:5, Jos 2:15, Ju 4:18, 8:25, 13:19, 16:19,
19:29, 20:16, 1 S 17:34, 19:13, 21:10, 2 S 17:17, 1 K 6:8, 13:14 (? most probably a particular
tree is meant); 19:9, Is 7:14 (??????????, i.e. the particular maiden, through whom the prophet’s
announcement shall be fulfilled; we should say a maiden [cf. Driver on 1 S 1:4, 6:8, 19:13];
Jb 9:31.

 Nu 11:27 is used like

????????

So always to write in the book (or on the scroll, Nu 5:23, Jer 32:10), i.e. not in the book
already in use, but in the book which is to be devoted to that purpose, equivalent to in a book,
on a scroll, Ex 17:14, 1 S 10:25, Jb 19:23. Especially instructive for this use of the article is
the phrase ????? ???????, which does not simply refer back to the previous narrative in the sense of
the same day, but is used exactly like our one day (properly meaning on the particular day
when it happened, i.e. on a certain day), 1 S 1:4, 14:1, 2 K 4:8, 11:18, Jb 1:6, 13. In Gn 39:11
even ????? ???????.

The article is sometimes used in this way before collectives in the singular, which are not
meant to denote (like the examples given under l) a whole class, but only that part of it which
applies to the given case; thus ????????, ??????? Gn 8:7, ????????? Ex 23:28.

5. When a substantive is defined by the article, or by a suffix, or by a following
genitive determinate in any way (see the examples below), the attribute belonging to it
(whether adjective, participle, ordinal, or demonstrative pronoun) necessarily takes
the article (see, however, the Rem.), e.g. Gn 10:12 ????????? ?????? the great city; Dt 3:24
?????????? ??????? thy strong hand. A genitive following the substantive may, according to §
127 a, be determined either by the article, e.g. 1 S 25:25 ????? ??????????? ???? this worthless
man (prop. man of worthlessness; cf. also such examples as 2 Ch 36:18, where the
article is prefixed only to a second genitive following the noun); or as a proper name,
e.g. Dt 11:7 ??????? ??????? ? ??????? the great work of the Lord; or by a suffix, e.g. Is 36:9
?????????? ??????? ??????? the least of my master’s servants.

When several attributes (whether connected by W?w or not) follow a determinate

substantive, each of them takes the article, e.g. Dt 10:17 ????????? ??????? ??????? ????? the
great God, the mighty, and the terrible. Cf. also Ex 3:3, Dt 1:19, in both of which
places a demonstrative with the article also follows the adjective.1

Rem. 1. The article is, however, not infrequently used also—

1 1 The demonstrative used adjectivally is generally placed after the adjective proper;
in such cases as  ?????? ????? ??????
 2 Ch 1:10 the adjective forms a further (fresh) addition
to ????? ??????.

?

(a) With the attribute alone, when it is added to an originally indefinite substantive as a
subsequent limitation; so always with ordinal numbers after ???, 2 e.g. Gn 1:31 (cf. 2:3, Ex
20:10, &c.) ????????? ??? the sixth day (prop. a day namely the sixth; but ??? ?? ??? a second day, Gn
1:8); Ex 12:15 ????????? ????? from the first day onward (not before Dn 10:12 and Neh 8:18 is
????????? ????????? used instead of it). On the other hand, the article is always found after ??, hence
????????? ?????, &c., although it is possible that the original reading in these cases was ?????, and
that the article is only due to the Masora. In Ju 6:25 the text is evidently corrupt (see verse
26).—Especially also in certain frequently recurring combinations as in particularizing the
gates in Jer 38:14, Ez 9:2, &c., Zc 14:10, and courts in 1 K 7:8, 12, &c., Ez 40:28; and very
often when the attribute consists of a participle, e.g. Dt 2:23, Ju 21:19, 1 S 25:10, Jer 27:3,
??????? ???  the sword which oppresses (?); Ez 14:22, Zc 11:2 Keth. (the impenetrable
46:16
???
forest?) Pr 26:18, Ps 119:21.

????????

) and Neh 9:35, the omission of the article after the preposition is

Of the other examples, Gn 21:29 (where, however, the Samaritan reads ??????), 41:26
(but cf. verse 4), Nu 11:25, Ju 16:27, 1 S 17:17 may at any rate be explained on the ground
that the preceding cardinal number is equivalent to a determinant; in Gn 1:21, 28:9, 10, &c.,
the substantive is already determined by ????, and in 1 S 14:29 (?????) by ?????.—In 1 S 12:23, 2
S 12:4, Is 7:20 (where, however, ??????????? might also be understood as a subsequent
explanation of
certainly due merely to the Masora. In 1 S 16:23 (unless ???????? ???? is to be read twice), Zc 4:7
(where however ????? ??? is probably meant), Ps 104:18 (where a ? precedes ??????, hence
probably a case of haplography), the omission of the article before ?, ? (?) and ? may be due
to a regard for euphony (see z below). On the other hand, in 1 S 6:18 (read
), 17:12
(????? is a later addition), 19:22 (cf. the LXX), Jer 17:2, 32:14, 40:3 Keth., Ez 2:3 (read ??? or
omit ????? with Cornill), Mi 7:11, Ps 62:4, either the text is corrupt, or the expression incorrect.
But in 2 K 20:13, Jer 6:20, Ct 7:10 acc. to D. H. Müller (Anzeiger der Wiener Akad., phil-hist.
Kl. 1902, no. x) ????? is the genitive of a substantive, aromatic oil, sweet cane (in Jer 6:20 read
???
??????), like spiced wine. In Is 39:2 read

????? ???  and in Ps 133:2

.
?????

???? ???

????? ???

?????

(b) No article with the attribute, while the substantive is determined either by the article,

or a suffix, or a following genitive. Thus the article is sometimes omitted with
demonstratives, since they are already to a certain extent determined by their meaning (cf.
also the Mêša(cid:31) inscription, l. 3, ??? ???? this high place); as with ??? Gn 19:33 (evidently for
euphony, and so probably often); 30:16, 32:23, 1 S 19:10; with ???? Gn 38:21; with ?? Ps 12:8
(according to the Masora ?? is a relative pronoun here, as always elsewhere); with
2:23, according to the present corrupt text (the original reading ???? ??????? became  ???????
??
, and ???????? was then corrupted to ?????); so, almost without exception, when the
substantive is determined only by a suffix, e.g. Jos 2:20, Ju 6:14, 1 K 10:8, 2 K 1:2 and 8:8 f.,
where ???, as in Jer 10:19, has arisen by contraction from ???????, or we should simply read ??????
(in all these passages with ???); Gn 24:8 (with ????); Ex 10:1, 1 K 22:23, Jer 31:21 (with

??????  1 S

??????

?????? ).

2 2 Cf. Driver, Tenses, 3rd ed., 209; M. Lambert, REJ. 31, 279 f.—The omission of
the article from the substantive is not to be regarded in this instance as an indication
of late style, and consequently cannot be put forward as a proof of the late origin of
the ‘Priestly Code’ (cf. Dillmann on Gn 1:31, Holzinger, Einl. in d. Hexateuch, p.
465, and especially Driver in the Journal of Philology, xi. 229 f., against Giesebrecht
in ZAW. 1881, p. 265 f.). On the other hand, the common omission of the article from
the substantive before a determinate adjective (e.g.
 the great synagogue,
in the Mishna; cf. Segal, Mišnaic Hebrew, p. 19 ff.) is certainly a later idiom.

????????? ???

????(cid:31)

The article is sometimes omitted also with the attributes referring to proper names,1 as
????? ?????? Jos 11:8, 19:28,
????? ???  Am 6:2. Other examples are Jos 16:3, 5, 18:13, 1 K 9:17
(but in 1 Ch 7:24, 2 Ch 8:5 with the article). In Gn 7:11, &c., ????? ????? is also a case of this
kind, ????? being used (almost always without the article) as a sort of proper name; cf. also  ???
??????? the most high God and ??? ???????? the living God. In Ju 1:15 ?????? ????? and ???????? ?? are
strange; Jos 15:19 has ??????? ?? and ????????? ??.

??

Of the remaining examples Is 11:9 explains itself; the direct connexion of the attribute
with its substantive is broken by the insertion of ?????. In Ez 34:12, Hag. 1:4 (as Wellhausen
says, a good instance of a Hebrew adjective in the stative form = ???????? ?????), Ps 143:10, Ct
6:12 (?) the substantive is also (see above) determined by a suffix, and consequently the
attribute is less closely attached; the same applies to Gn 37:2, 42:19, 43:14, Ps 18:18, except
that in these passages the omission of the article before ?, ?, ? may at the same time be due to
considerations of euphony (as also in Jos 16:1 before ?, Nu 14:37 before ?, 28:4, Ez 10:9
before ?, 21:19 before ?).1 In 1 S 13:17 f. (?????) and 2 K 25:16 (
substantive), the attribute again, being a numeral, is determinate in itself (see above, x); in Is
65:2 the ??? prevents the use of the article; finally, in 2 Ch 26:15 ???????? and ??????????? are to be
read, as in Jer 2:21
??????  for ????; in 2 S 6:3 omit ? ??????, and in Ez 39:27
omit ??????. Without any apparent reason the article is omitted in Dn 8:13 and 11:31.

§ 127. The Noun determined by a following Determinate Genitive.

Brockelmann, Grundriss, i. 475.

When a genitive, determined in any way, follows a nomen regens, it also

determines the nomen regens, which, according to § 89 a, is always in the construct
state. Moreover, every pronominal suffix attached to a substantive is, according to §
33 c, to be considered as a genitive determinate by nature. An independent genitive
may be determinate—

(a) By its character as a proper name (according to § 125 a), e.g. ??????? ????? the

word of the Lord.

(b) By having the article, e.g. ??????????? ???? (prop. the man of the war) the soldier
(but ????????? ???? Jos 17:1, a soldier); ??????????? ? ????? Nu 31:49, the soldiers; ???????? ????? the
word of the prophet, Jer 28:9 (but e.g., on the other hand,
commandment of men which hath been taught, Is 29:13;
Pr 29:12).

omitted before

 probably only for euphony.

????

????

(c) By the addition of a pronominal suffix (see above), e.g. ?????????? my father’s

house.

(d) By construction with another genitive determined in some way, e.g. Gn 3:2
?????????? ??????? of the fruit of the trees of the garden. Thus in Is 10:12 four, and in 21:17
even five, members of a series are determined by a concluding determinate genitive.

Rem. 1. The above explains also the various meanings of ??? (prop. a substantive in the

sense of aggregate, whole), according as it is followed by a determinate or indeterminate
genitive. In the former case ??? has the meaning of the entirety, i.e. all, the whole (like the
French tous les hommes, toute la ville), e.g. ?????????? the whole (prop. the entirety of the)
earth, ??????????? all men; 1 Ex 18:22, Nu 15:13, Jer 4:29, and cases like Nu 4:23, 47, 21:8
where ??? is followed by a singular participle with the article. On the other hand, before an
indeterminate genitive ??? is used in the more indefinite (individualizing) sense of of all kinds,
any (cf. tout homme, à tout prix), or distributively each, every, e.g. ??????? every (kind of) tree,
Gn 2:9; cf. 4:22, 24:10, 1 Ch 29:2;
Ps 7:12.

 any thing, Ju 19:19; ????????? every day, every time,

?????

????

It is, however, to be observed—

(a) That the article may in this case also (see § 126 h) be omitted in poetic style, although

the substantive is to be regarded as determinate, e.g.

??????? ????  all (the) tables, Is 28:8.

??

(b) That the meaning every is frequent even before singulars used collectively; afterwards
the idea of quisque passes naturally into that of totality, e.g. ??????? each living thing, i.e. every
(not every kind of) living thing; ? ???????? all flesh, i.e. all men or all living creatures (with the
article only in Gn 7:15 before a relative clause, and in Is 40:6); sometimes also ??????? all trees,
??????? all birds; finally—

(c) That before the names of members of the human body, ???? frequently (as being
determinate in itself) denotes the entirety, e.g. Is 1:5 the whole head, the whole heart (the
sense required by the context, not every head, &c., which the expression in itself might also
mean); 9:11, 2 K 23:3, Ez 29:7 all (i.e. the whole of) their shoulders … all (the whole of) their
loins; 36:5.—On ??? with a suffix when it follows a noun in apposition (e.g. Is 9:8 ???? ????? the
people, all of it, i.e. the whole nation, more emphatic than ?????????, cf. Driver on 2 S 2:9), as
well as when it follows absolutely in the genitive (= all men, every one, e.g. Gn 16:12),2 see
the Lexicon, pp. 481b, 482b.

2. Gentilic names (or patronymics), derived from compound proper names (consisting of
a nomen regens and genitive), are determined by inserting the article before the second part of
the compound (since it contains the original genitive), e.g. ???????????? (see § 86 h) a Benjamite,
?????????????? Ju 3:15, &c., the Benjamite; ??????????????? the Bethlehemite, 1 S 16:1, &c. (cf., however,
1 Ch 27:12 Qerê ???????? ?????); ? ??????????????? the Beth-shemite, 1 S 6:14; ?????????? ????? the Abiezrite, Ju
6:11, &c., cf. 1 K 16:34.

3. In a few instances the nomen regens appears to be used indefinitely notwithstanding a
following determinate genitive; it is not so, however, in Gn 16:7, where the reference is to a
well-known fountain; 21:28, where in the original context there must have been some reason
for the seven ewe lambs of the flock; 2 S 12:30 the spoil found in the city; but it often is so

1 1 ??????? being a collective, cf. ?????????? 2 S 15:2, all men, ????????? Ex 1:22 all sons,
????????? all daughters; in itself ??????????? could also mean the whole man.
2 2 In Ezr 10:17 instead of

 read simply ?? ???????????????.

?????? ?????

??

before a proper name, as in Ex 10:9 ??????? ??? a feast of the Lord (unless it is the spring
festival), Dt 7:25, and frequently ??????? ???????? an abomination unto the Lord; cf. also Gn 46:34,
Dt 22:19 a virgin of Israel; 1 S 4:12 a man of Benjamin; Pr 25:1, Ct 2:1, 3:9; similarly before
appellatives with the article (or before a genitive determined by a suffix, as in Lv 14:34), 1 S
20:20 three arrows; 2 S 23:11 ???????? ??????? a plot of the ground (but see Gn 33:19, Jos 24:32);
Ju 13:6, Jer 13:4, 41:16, Ct 1:11, 13 f., 5:13, 7:3, 8:2. On the other hand, ?????????? ?? ?? in the
titles of Psalms 120 to 134 (except 121:1, ?????????? ?? ??) was most probably originally the title
of a collection, in the sense of ‘the pilgrimage-songs’ (according to § 124 r), and was
subsequently added to these Psalms severally.—In Ex 20:24 ????????????? in all the place, sc. of
the sanctuary, is a dogmatic correction of ???????????, in every place, to avoid the difficulty that
several holy-places are here authorized, instead of the one central sanctuary. In Gn 20:13 also
??????????? (unless it means in the whole place) is remarkable, since elsewhere every place is
always (8 times) ?????????.

4. The deviations mentioned under e, from a fundamental rule of syntax, are in some
cases open to suspicion on textual grounds, but much more doubtful are the instances in
which the article is found before a noun already determined in some other way, as—

(a) Before a noun which appears to be determined by a following independent

determinate genitive. The least questionable are the instances in which the genitive is a proper
name, since these may be elliptical forms of expression like the apparent construction of
proper names with a genitive, noticed in § 125 h, e.g. Nu 21:14 ?????? ?????????? the valleys,
namely the valleys of Arnon; 2 K 23:17 ???????? ????????? the altar, namely the altar of Bethel (i.e.
with the suppression of the real nomen regens, ??????? without the article; by the pointing ?????????
the Masora evidently intends to allow the choice either of reading ?????????? or correcting it to
???????); ???????? ????? the God of Beth-el1 (equivalent to ?? ??? ?????), Gn 31:13 (the LXX read  ?????
??????? ??????? ????????? the God who appeared to thee in the holy place); ????? ???????? the king of
Assyria, Is 36:16 (probably a scribal error due to verse 13; it does not occur in the parallel
passage, 2 K 18:31), cf. Jos 13:5, 2 K 25:11, Jer 38:6, Ez 47:15; in the vocative, Jer 48:32, La
2:13. On the other hand, ???? ??? ?? Gn 24:67 is no doubt only a subsequent insertion; so also
????? ???? Jos 8:33b (cf. LXX), 2 S 20:23, 2 K 7:13,
Masora to ?????? Qerê);  ??? ???????
(unless the article with ????? is to be omitted), also ???????? Dn 8:13, and ???????? ????? 2 Ch 15:8.
In Ex 9:18 read with the Samaritan ???????; in 2 S 19:25
apposition to ????? ?????; in 2 K 10:1 restore ?????????, with the LXX and Lucian, before ?????; in 2
K 25:19 omit the article, as in Jer 52:25, before ?????.

 2 K 23:12, ????? Is 36:8 (cf. 2 K 18:23), ??????? Ez 46:19

 1 S 26:22 after ???????? (simplified by the

??????  might possibly be taken in

?????????

?

A similar ellipse must also be assumed in 2 K 23:17 the sepulchre is the sepulchre of the
man of God (but most probably ????? has dropped out after ???????) and Ps 123:4 (cf., however,
the LXX, and observe that in the parallel member the genitive is paraphrased by ??).—In Jos
3:14 ???????? (verse 17 ???? ??????) has been added to the original ??????? by a redactor; cf. similar
syntactically impossible additions in verse 11 (also in 1 S 4:3, &c., where the LXX still had
simply ???? ?????); in ??????? Ju 16:14 the Masora evidently combines two different readings ???????
 was only subsequently introduced into
and
the text), the two readings ??????????? and ???? ????????? are combined.—In Jos 8:11, 1 K 14:24, Jer
31:40, Ez 45:16 the article, being usual after ????, has been mechanically added, and so also in
?????? ) is occasioned by the first; in
2 Ch 8:16 after ????; in 2 K 9:4 the second

the accusative, as also

correct reading

confusion of two readings,
the article is simply to be omitted) is in apposition to ???????.

(b) Before a noun with a suffix (which likewise represents a determinate genitive; see
above, at the beginning of this section). This does not apply to cases in which a verbal (i.e.

accusative) suffix is affixed to a participle which has the article, e.g.
smiting him; in Dt 8:15, 13:6 also ?? is a verbal suffix, but hardly the ? in ??????? for
???

Job 40:19, nor the ? ?? in ?????????? Dn 11:6; § 116 g. For ??????????? Lev 27:23, read ???????? as in verses
2, 3, 5, 7, 13, &c., twelve times (but cf. also the note on § 128 d).—Of the remaining
examples ??????????? Is 24:2 (probably an intentional alliteration with the eleven other words
beginning with ??  ),

§ 128. The Indication of the Genitive Relation by means of the Construct State.

Cf. especially Philippi’s work cited at the head of § 89.

1. The genitive relation is regularly expressed (see § 89) by the close connexion of

the nomen regens (in the construct state) with the nomen rectum (in the genitive).
Since only one nomen regens can be immediately connected with a nomen rectum, it
follows that the same genitive cannot depend on two or more co-ordinate nouns, but a
second (sometimes even a third, &c.) regens must be added with a suffix referring to
the nomen rectum, e.g. ????????? ????? ????? the sons of David and his daughters (not  ?????? ?????
?????); cf. 1 K 8:28.1 The language also prefers to avoid a series of several co-ordinate2
genitives depending upon one and the same nomen regens (such as occur in Gn 14:19,
Nu 20:5, 31:54 [1 Ch 13:1], 1 S 23:7, 2 S 19:6, Is 22:5, Ps 5:7, 8:3),3 and rather tends
to repeat the nomen regens, e.g. Gn 24:3
 the God of heaven
????
and the God of the earth (so in Jer 8:1 the regens is five times repeated). A lengthened
series of genitives may, however, be formed by a nomen rectum serving at the same
time as regens to a genitive depending on it (cf. § 127 a [d]); e.g. Gn 47:9
??? ?? ?????
??????? the days of the years of the life of my fathers; cf. Jb 12:24, where there are three
genitives, Is 10:12 four, and 21:17 five (unless the last three are in apposition). As a

??? ????????? ???
?

??????? ???????

 ?????

????????? ???????
????(cid:31)?

 may at any rate also be taken as an absolute genitive, so also

); Pr 16:11.—In Is 11:2 the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of
 Dn

1 1 Very rare, and only possible in very rapid utterance, are such exceptions as Ez
?????
31:16 (
the Lord,
1:4.
2 2 In Ps 114:1 a second genitive is added even without the copula, but the parallelism
of the members renders any misunderstanding impossible.
3 3 In almost all these instances the two (or three) genitives form one closely
connected whole, as heaven and earth, sons and daughters.

??(cid:31)???

rule, indeed, such an inconvenient accumulation of genitives is avoided by means of a
circumlocution in the case of one of them (see §129 d).

Rem. As the fundamental rules stated above are the necessary consequence not merely of

logical but more especially of rhythmical relations (see § 89 a), we must feel the more
hesitation in admitting examples in which genitives are supposed to be loosely attached to
forms other than the construct state. Some of these examples (the supposed genitives
following a regens which is determined by the article) have been already discussed in § 127
f–h. Compare, moreover:

????

?? ???????

?? ??????? ?????? ????????

 then depends, in reality explains

(a) Genitives after the absolute state, e.g. Is 28:1

 the fat valley of them
that are overcome with wine. The usual explanation that ?????? ???????? forms one single idea (in
German Fettigkeitstal), on which the genitive
????
nothing; the text is almost certainly corrupt. In Dt 15:18 ??? ???? would be expected; in Jos 3:11
???????? is a later addition; in Is 32:13 (?????), and Ps 68:22 (??? ??), the absolute for the construct
state probably rests only on the authority of the Masoretes. In Ju 6:25 ff. the text is obviously
in confusion. In Ju 8:32 (cf. 6:24) ????????? should come either after ????????? or at the end of the
verse, unless, with Moore, we omit ????? ????? as a gloss (from 6:24); in Is 63:11 ? ??? is probably
a gloss on ??????????? which has crept into the text; in 2 S 4:2
, according to the LXX,
has dropped out before ???; in Ez 6:11 ????? is to be omitted with the LXX; if originally in the
text, it could only be genitive (= all abominations of evils), not an adjective; Pr 21:6 the text is
altogether uncertain (the LXX read ? ??????? for ? ????????); in 1 Ch 9:13 the preposition ?? (after a ?)
has dropped out before ???????? (cf. 12:25).—Elsewhere (Dt 3:5, 1 K 4:13, 2 Ch 8:5) the
supposed genitives are to be taken rather as words of nearer definition standing in apposition,
i.e. with high walls, gates, and bars. In Jer 8:5 ??????? is either in apposition to ??? ??? or is
better (since not in the LXX) omitted as a gloss.

????????

?? ??

(b) Genitives after a noun with a suffix (where the suffix prevents the direct government
by the nomen regens). Thus in Lv 27:3, 5, 6, where ??????? after ????????1 might be taken, contrary
to the accents, as subject of the following clause; in Lv 5:15, 25 the suffix may refer to
Moses. In Lv 6:3 ??? ???? his garment, namely the garment of linen, unless simply in
apposition, cf. § 131 d (or read ??????); Lv 26:42, where ???? ???????? ???????? could at most be
explained as an ellipse for ???????? ?????? ????????, cf. § 125 h (probably, however, it is a case of
dittography of the ?, which was repeated also before ?????; so Valeton, ZAW. xii. 3); equally
strange is ????? ???????? Jer 33:20, &c. On the other hand, ??????? ??????????? ???????? ??? Nu 12:6 could not
possibly mean if your prophet be a prophet of the Lord; the text is manifestly corrupt
(probably ????????? ?????????? is to be read, with Marti). In Ps 45:7 ???????? ???????? (usually explained as
thy divine throne), ????? is most probably a later addition [another suggestion is to read
????????? like God(’s throne): cf. § 141 d, note]. In Jer 52:20 two readings are probably
combined, ??? ???????? without any addition, and
????????????
apposition to ????????. On ????? ???????? Ez 16:27, cf. § 131 r.

. In Nu 25:12 ??? ?? is in

??????

 ? ??

(c) The interposition of a word is assumed between ???? (the whole; cf. § 127 b) and the
genitive governed by it in 2 S 1:9, Jb 27:3 (???), and, if the text is correct, in Hos 14:3 (??????).
In reality, however, in all three places the genitive relation is destroyed by the transposition of
the words (instead of ???? ???, &c.), and ???? is rather to be taken adverbially (equivalent to
wholly), e.g. 2 S 1:9 because my life is yet wholly in me, i.e. my whole life; cf. Philippi, Stat.
Constr., p. 10.—On the instances in which the original construct state ???? non-existence is
used without a following genitive, see the negative sentences, § 152 o.

1 1 Halévy, J. A. xiv. 548, removes the difficulty by pointing ????????.
ZAW. ZAW, = Zeitschrift für die alttestamentliche Wissenschaft, ed. by B. Stade,
Giessen, 1881 ff., and since 1907 by K. Marti.

2. The dependence of the nomen rectum on the nomen regens by no means
represents merely what is, properly speaking, the genitive relation (see the examples
under g–i). Very frequently the nomen rectum only adds a nearer definition of the
nomen regens, whether by giving the name, the genus or species, the measure, the
material, or finally an attribute of it (genit. epexegeticus or appositionis, 1 see the
examples under k–q).

Examples. The nomen rectum represents—

(a) A subjective genitive, specifying the possessor, author, &c., e.g.

?????????

 the king’s

?????

house; ??????? ????? the word of the Lord.

(b) An objective genitive, e.g. Ob10 ?????? ???????? for the violence done to thy brother2 (but in
Ez 12:19 ???????? is followed by a subjective genitive); Pr 20:2
 the terror of a king; Gn
18:20 ????? ???????? the cry concerning Sodom; Is 23:5 ??? ??? ?? the report of (about) Tyre, cf. 2 S
4:4; Am 8:10
?????? ???  the mourning for an only son; Dt 20:14 ?????????? ??? ?? praeda hostibus tuis
erepta; cf. Is 3:14. In a wider sense this includes such examples as
(i.e. to) the tree of life, Gn 3:24; cf. Pr 7:27, Jb 38:20;
????? ????  the way of (by) the sea, Is 8:23;
???????? ??????? the sacrifices of (i.e. pleasing to) God, Ps 51:19; ??????? ????? ?? the oath of (i.e. sworn
before) the Lord, 1 K 2:48; ??????? ??????? the words of (i.e. addressed to) L., Pr 31:1.

????????? ??? ????  the way of
???

?? ??????

?????

???

???

(c)A partitive genitive; this includes especially the cases in which an adjective in the

construct state is followed by a general term, e.g. ???????? ?? ??????? the wisest of her ladies, Ju
5:29; cf. for this way of expressing the superlative, § 133 h, and also r below.

Merely formal genitives (genit. explicativus or epexegeticus, genit. appositionis) are those

added to the construct state as nearer definitions—

(d) Of the name, e.g. ????? ????? the river Euphrates;

????

???? ???

???

 the land of Canaan;  ???????

????? ???? the virgin Israel (not of Israel), Am 5:2.

(e) Of the genus, e.g. Pr 15:20 (2120) ???? ?????? a fool of a man (=a foolish man); cf. Gn

16:12, Is 1:4, 29:19, Ho 13:2, Mi 5:4, &c.

(f) Of the species, e.g.

(cid:31)???

?? ???????

 a possession of a burying-place, i.e. hereditary

sepulchre, Gn 23:4, &c.; ????????? ??????? the early figs, Jer 24:2;
house, i.e. my dwelling-place, Ps 132:3.

?????? ???

???

 the tabernacle of my

number, Gn 34:30, Dt 26:5; cf. also Ez 47:3–5 waters of the ankles, waters of the loins,
waters of swimming, i.e. which reached up to the ankles, or loins, or necessitated swimming;

(hostium, Pompeii, &c.), spes, and other words. In Greek, cf. ?????? ??? ?????,

 holiness very frequently serves as a periphrasis for the adjective ?????

(i) Of the attribute of a person or thing, e.g. Gn 17:8 ????? ??????? an everlasting possession;
Pr 17:8 a precious stone; cf. Nu 28:6, Is 13:8, 28:4, Ps 23:2, 31:3, Pr 5:19, 14:5, Jb 41:19, and
the examples of the genitive with a suffix given in § 135 n. Such a periphrasis for the
expression of attributes frequently occurs, even when the corresponding adjectives are in use.
Thus especially
(e.g.
???? ???????
reference to persons (hence also with ??? and ??? people, and with ? ?? the name of a person);
 holy water, Nu 5:17;
the only exceptions are ????? ????? holy place, Ex 29:31, &c.;
????? as the predicate of ??? day, Neh 8:10 f., and of ???????? camp, Dt 23:15. So also the use of
?????? righteous is always confined to persons, except in Dt 4:8; elsewhere the periphrasis with
??????  or ??????? is always used, e.g.

??????
 the holy garments, Ex 29:29), since ????? is used almost exclusively in

 just balances, Lv 19:36.

?? ????? ???

?? ?????????

In a wider sense this use of the genitive also includes statements of the purpose for which

something is intended, e.g. ??????? ???? sheep for the slaughter, Ps 44:23;
chastisement designed for our peace, Is 53:5; cf. 51:17 (the cup which causes staggering), Ps
116:13; finally, also, the description of the material, with which something is laden or filled,
e.g. 1 S 16:20
?? ?????? ???

??? ???? is to be read for ?????); cf. Gn 21:14, Pr 7:20, &c.

Rem. 1. Certain substantives are used to convey an attributive idea in the construct state

before a partitive genitive; thus ??????? choice, selection, as in Gn 23:6
our sepulchres, i.e. our choicest sepulchres; Ex 15:4, Is 22:7, 37:24; other examples are, Is
1:16 the evil of your doings, emphatically, for your evil doings; Is 17:4, 37:24 (=the tall
cedars thereof), Ps 139:22, Jb 15:26.—This is the more common construction with the
substantive ??? entirety, for all, the whole, every, see § 127 b; it is also frequent with ????? a
little, for few, 1 S 17:28, &c.

2. To the periphrases expressing attributive ideas (see p above) by means of a genitive
construction may be added the very numerous combinations of the construct states ???? a man,
????? master, possessor, ???? son, and their feminines and plurals (including ????? men, used only
in the plural), with some appellative noun, in order to represent a person (poetically even a
thing) as possessing some object or quality, or being in some condition. In English, such
combinations are sometimes rendered by single substantives, sometimes by circumlocution.

Examples:—

(a) Of ????, &c.; ???????? ???? an eloquent man, Ex 4:10 (but

???? ?? ????

 Jb 11:2 a man of lips,

????

i.e. a boaster); ????? ???? = a slanderer, Ps 140:12;
????? a wrathful man, Pr 15:18; ?????? ???? a man of blood, 2 S 16:7, Ps 5:7; cf. further, 1 S 16:18,
1 K 2:26, Is 53:3, Pr 19:6, 26:21, 29:1, Ezr 8:18; also
27:15; in the plural, e.g. Gn 6:4 ?????? ? ????? the men of renown, famous; cf. Gn 47:6, Is 41:11,

?????????? ? ??  a contentious woman, Pr

 a man of knowledge, Pr 24:5;  ????

denominative from

????
, ?? ?????, ?? ? ????? and even simply
??????????
, like the Latin scelus for scelestissimus, 2 S 23:6, Jb 34:18. Plural masculine, e.g.  ?????
??????  children of rebellion, Nu 17:25. ???? is used poetically of things without life, e.g. Is 5:1
????
 i.e. grown in a night; Jb 41:20 son of the
bow (i.e. an arrow); so also ? ???? ????? = sparks, Jb 5:7; La 3:13; ????? Ec 12:4 the daughters of
song, probably meaning the individual notes.

 a fat, i.e. a fruitful (hill); Jon 4:10

 worthy to die, 1 S 20:31

????

There is another use of ???? or ????? to denote membership of a guild or society (or of a tribe,

or any definite class). Thus ???????? ????? or ??????????? ????? Gn 6:2, 4, Jb 1:6, 2:1, 38:7 (cf. also  ?????
?????? Ps 29:1, 89:7) properly means not sons of god(s), but beings of the class of ???????? or
??????; ?????????????????? 1 K 20:35 (singular in Am 7:14) persons belonging to the guild of prophets;
????
Similarly ?? ???? ?? ????? Gn 50:23 are most probably not great-grandsons but grandsons, i.e. those
belonging to the third generation. Cf. also
 Nu 4:27 f. Gershonites, ?????????? ????? 2 Ch
20:19, &c., Kohathites;

 Neh 3:8 one of the guild of apothecaries, cf. 3:31 where ??????????????? is to be read.

????? ?????

3. Special mention must be made of the not infrequent idiom by which adjectives

(sometimes also ordinals, see § 134 o) are added in the genitive, like substantives, rather than
as attributes in the same state, gender, and number as the noun which they qualify; thus, Is
28:4 ????? ?????? the flower of that which fades, for which verse 1 has ????? ???? the fading flower;
cf. further, Is 22:24, Jer 22:17 (?), 52:13, Ps 73:10, 74:15 (but ?????? may be a substantive),
??? ? ?? ), &c., analogous to
78:49; also the use of ??? as a substantive, e.g. in Pr 2:14 b, 6:24 (
the New Testament phrase ? ??????µ?? ??? ???????, Luke 16:8, and the French un homme de
bien.1—Finally, an adverb (treated as a substantive) may likewise be used as an epexegetical
genitive; cf. ????? ????? blood shed without cause, 1 K 2:31; Pr 24:28, 26:2; Ez 30:16 (?????).

???

3. The epexegetical genitives include finally the numerous nearer definitions
which follow the coustruct state of adjectives (and of active and passive participles, or
verbal adjectives, cf. § 116 f–l). For, while the word of nearer definition is added to
the verb in the accusative (e.g. ???????????? ????? he was diseased in his feet, 1 K 15:23), it
may, with participles and verbal adjectives, be either in the accusative (§ 116 f and k)
or in the genitive, the case of a word depending on a noun. Such a genitive relation is
usually termed an improper annexion. The nearer definition contains a statement

1 1 On the other hand, in such passages as Is 36:2 (2 K 18:17), Zc 14:4, Ec 8:10, &c.,
there is no apparent reason why the Masora requires the construct state instead of the
absolute; hence ???? Is 36:2 and ???? Zc 14:4 must be intended as forms of the absolute
state, shortened in consequence of their close connexion.

?????? ????? ????? ???  a land flowing with milk and

either of the material, e.g. Ex 3:8, &c.,
honey; or of the means, e.g.
????
2:5 sick of love; or of the scope of the attribute,1 e.g. Gn 39:6
Gn 41:2, 4, Ex 34:6, Is 1:4, Jer 32:19, Na 1:3, Ps 119:1, Jb 37:16; or of the manner,
e.g. Ps 59:6  ? ????????

 fair of form; cf.

???

????

 clean as regards hands, &c.; 2 S 9:3, Is 6:5, Jb 17:9; Is 19:10

Especially frequent is the use of this genitive to name the part of the body
described as being affected by some physical or mental condition, e.g. Ps 24:4  ?????
????????
 grieved
in soul; 1 S 1:10, Jb 3:20. Also such examples as Am 2:16, Pr 19:1, where a suffix is
attached to the substantive, must be regarded as instances of the genitive construction,
on the analogy of Pr 14:2, see § 116 k.

§ 129. Expression of the Genitive by Circumlocution.

Pesides the construction of a nomen rectum dependent upon a nomen regens in the

construct state (§§ 89 and 128), the connexion of two nouns may also be effected
otherwise, either by simply attaching the dependent noun by means of the preposition
??, which, according to § 119 r, expresses, besides other ideas, like that of belonging
to,2 or by the addition of a relative clause (?? ? ????, see h below).

1. The introduction of a genitive by ?? sometimes occurs even when the construction with

the construct state would be equally possible, e.g. 1 S 14:16 ??? ???? ???????? the watchmen of
Saul; Ps 37:16, 2 Ch 28:18 (where indeed the circumlocution makes the sense much plainer);
as a rule, however, this use is restricted to the following cases:—

(a) To prevent a nomen regens being determined by a following determinate genitive, e.g.

1 S 16:18 ? ?????? ??? a son of Jesse (? ???????? would be, according to § 127 a, the son of Jesse); cf.
Gn 14:18, 36:12, 41:12, Nu 16:22 (2716), 1 S 17:8, 2 S 19:21, Ps 122:5. Hence, regularly  ???????
??????? (Ps 3:1, &c.) a psalm of David (properly belonging to David as the author), for which
??????? of David is used alone elliptically in Ps 11:1, 14:1, &c. Such a case as ??????? ??????? (Ps 24:1,
&c.) is not to be regarded as a transposition, but ??????? is used epexegetically for the general
term omitted before ??????? (as it were, a poem of David, a psalm). Moreover, the introduction of
the author, poet, &c., by this Lamed auctoris is the customary idiom also in the other Semitic
dialects, especially in Arabic.

(b) When a genitive is to be made dependent on a nomen regens, which is itself composed

of a nomen regens and rectum, and represents, as a compound, one united idea, e.g. Ru 2:3
??????? ???????? ??????? the portion of field belonging to Boaz (????? ??? ?? ??? would be the portion of
the field of Boaz); 2 K 5:9 at the house-door of Elisha. This especially applies to the cases in
which the compound regens represents a term in very common use, the fixed form of which

1 1 Cf. the Latin integer vitae scelerisque purus; tristes animi, &c.
2 2 Cf. the ???µ? ?????????? in Greek, e.g. ? ?????? ?? ??????? for ???
???????? (Bernhardy’s Syntax, p. 88). The Arab grammarians distinguish a twofold
genitive, one of which may be resolved by ??, and the other by ??? [see Wright’s Arabic
Grammar, vol. ii, § 75 ff.]. The de of the Romance languages is a development of the
latter idea; the Gascon, however, says e.g. la fille à Mr. N., laying stress upon the idea
of belonging to and not that of origin, as in la fille de … of the literary language.

(c) When for any other reason the construction with the nomen regens in the construct
state is inadmissible; cf. e.g. Lv 18:20, where ???????? ??, on account of the suffix, cannot be used
in the construct state; but Lv 15:16 ff., &c.,
; Ju 3:28 the Jordan fords of Moab (???????
????
as a proper name cannot be used in the construct state); Ex 20:5 upon the third and upon the
fourth generation of them that hats me; ?????????????? must be kept in the absolute state for the
sake of conformity with ?? ???????????, and for the same reason also ?????????? ???????????.

seven and twentieth day of the month; cf. 7:11, 16:3 and frequently, or as in Hag 1:1  ??? ????
????
 in the second year of Darius; the numeral here is always one compound idea
with the substantive numbered, and consequently (as in the examples under b) does not admit
of being in the constr. st. with a genitive. The same naturally applies also to such examples as
 on the third day of my giving birth (i.e. after my giving birth). Cf.
1 K 3:18  ???????? ? ?????????? ?????
????
???? ???????
also the standing phrase

 on the first (day) of the month, Gn 8:5 and frequently.

Rem. In cases like 2 S 3:2 and his firstborn was Amnon

2. The periphrastic expression of the genitive by means of ?? ? ???? is used principally to
 her father’s sheep (prop. the sheep which

state the possessor, e.g. Gn 29:9
belonged to her father); Gn 47:4 and frequently. So also (according to § 128 a) when a
genitive depends on more than one substantive, e.g. Gn 40:5 the butler and the baker who
(belonged) to the king of Egypt (
 would indicate only the baker as belonging
?? ???????
?
to the king); or when a genitive (as in the examples under d above) is added to a compound,
which expresses one united idea (Ru 4:3); or when, as a fixed term (e.g. a title), it appears
always in the same form, e.g. Ct 1:1
S 21:8, 2 S 2:8, 1 Ch 11:10; cf. also Gn 41:43.1

§ 130. Wider Use of the Construct State.

The construct state, which, according to § 89 a, primarily represents only the
immediate government by one substantive of the following word (or combination of
words), is frequently employed in rapid narrative as a connecting form, even apart
from the genitive relation; so especially—

(1) Before prepositions,l particularly in elevated (prophetic or poetic) style,

especially when the nomen regens is a participle. Thus before ??, ???????? ????? ?? the joy in
the harvest, Is 9:2, 2 S 1:21, Ps 136:8f.; in participles, Is 5:11, 9:1, 19:8, Ps 84:7, and
?? ??????? ; cf.
especially often when ?? with a suffix follows the participle, e.g. Ps 2:12

??

) is used like the simple relative ???, ?? in Aramaic, as an independent sign of

1 1 In New Hebrew ? ?? (derived from ?? ?? = ?? ? ????, see § 36, and cf. Ct 1:6, 3:7 ??? ??,
?
???? ???? ??
the genitive.

Na 1:7, Jer 8:16 (Ps 24:1); Ps 64:9 (unless ????? should be read); 98:7.2—Before ??, Ho

(before ????); 1 Ch 6:55, 23:28; in participles, Ez 38:11, Jb 24:5; before ?? with an
infinitive, Is 56:10, and again before ?? with a suffix, Gn 24:21, Is 30:18, 64:3; 3—
before ????, Is 14:19, Ez 21:17; —before ???? (with), Is 8:6; —before ???, Gn 3:22, Is
28:9 (a participle); Jer 23:23, Ez 13:2, Ho 7:5; —before ????, Ju 5:10; —before ???????, Is
14:6; —before the nota accus. ??, Jer 33:22; —before a locative (which in such cases
also serves as a genitive), Ex 27:13, Jer 1:15.

(2) Before w?w; copulative, e.g. Ez 26:10; but ??????? Is 33:6, ?????? 35:2, and ????? ??
51:21 may be cases of an intentional reversion to the old feminine ending ath, in order
to avoid the hiatus (??)?? ? ??.

(3) When it governs the (originally demonstrative) pronoun ? ????; so especially in

the combination ? ???? ?????, Gn 39:20, 40:3, the place where (prop. of that in which)
Joseph was bound; cf. § 138 g; or ? ???? ??????? Lv 4:24, 33, 2 S 15:21, 1 K 21:19, Jer
22:12, Ez 21:35, Ho 2:1. We should expect ? ???? ???????, ? ???? ???????, as in Gn 35:13,
&c., at the place which …, cf. § 138; but ? ???? is treated as a nomen rectum instead of
as an attribute. Cf. also ?? ????? followed by a perfect in 1 S 29:8, and ?? ????? Lv 13:46,
Nu 9:18.1

(4) When it governs independent sentences (cf. § 155), which virtually stand to

????

the construct state (as nomen regens) in a sort of genitive relation, e.g. Ex 4:13
??? ?????????? prop. by the hand of him whom thou wilt send; Nu 23:3
matter of that which he shall show me, i.e. whatever he shall; Is 29:1
city where David encamped; Jer 48:36, Ps 16:3 (if the text be right), 65:5 (Pr 8:32), Ps
81:6, Jb 18:21 the place of him that knoweth not God; Jb 29:16, La 1:14 (if the text be
right) into the hands of those against whom I cannot stand.2 In Gn 39:4 (??????????) the
???? takes after it a noun-clause, and in Ex 9:4, still more boldly, a subst. with ??.—
Very often a time-determination governs the following sentence in this way; thus ???????
followed by a perfect, Lv 25:48, 1 S 5:9;
6:28, Nu 3:1, Dt 4:15, 2 S 22:1, Ps 18:1, 59:17, 138:3 (in every case before a
following perfect), Ps 56:10 (before an imperfect); ????? followed by the perfect, Jer

?????  Ps 102:3 (before a noun-clause), Ex

?????????? ?????
????? ????? ?

 the

2 2 In Ju 8:11 the article is even used before a construct state followed by ??, in order
to determine the whole combination ??????????? ????? ?? tent-dwellers, taken as one word;
cf., however, the remarks in § 127 f–i on similar grammatical solecisms.
3 3 These are to be distinguished from the cases where ?? follows a construct state,
which in conjunction with ??? (and the following ??) has become a sort of preposition or
adverb of place; thus, we have ????????? Ex 26:33 (for which in Ez 1:27 merely ?? ????)
meaning simply within; ?? ??????? (2 K 23:13, Ez 10:3) on the right hand (i.e. south) of;
?? ??????? (Jos 8:11, 13, &c., Ju 2:9) on the north of; cf. also Jos 15:21 and ??? ??????? Neh
13:4.
1 1 In Dt 23:5 the construct state governs a sentence introduced by the conjunction
? ???? (? ???? ????????? by reason of the fact that, i.e. because); so also in 1 S 3:13.
2 2 Probably Gn 22:14 is also to be so explained (contrary to the accents), and
certainly (contrary to the very unnatural division of the verses) 2 Ch 30:18, which
should read on thus:
that setteth his heart to seek God. [See Wickes’ Accontuation of the Twenty-one Prose
Books of the Old Testament, p. 140.]

???????? be a gloss).

??

Rem. Some of the above passages may also be explained by supposing that there exists a

real genitive relation towards the preceding construct state, which has been, as it were,
provisionally left in suspenso, in consequence of the insertion of some interrupting word, e.g.
Is 37:22, &c.; Jb 20:17 a. Elsewhere (Dt 33:19, Ps 68:34) the nomen regens probably governs
the following construct state directly.4

(6) The numeral ???? one for ????? in close connexion, and even with small

disjunctives, e.g. Gn 3:22, 48:22, 1 S 9:3, 2 S 17:22, Is 27:12, Zc 11:7.

The character of these passages shows that the numeral here cannot be in the construct

state, but is merely a rhythmical shortening of the usual (tone-lengthened) form.

§ 131. Apposition.

1. Apposition in the stricter sense is the collocation of two substantives in the
same case in order to define more exactly (or to complete) the one by the other, and,
as a rule (see, however, below, under g), the former by the latter. Apposition in
Hebrew (as in the other Semitic languages1) is by no means confined to those cases in
which it is used in English or in the classical languages. It is not infrequently found
when either the subordination of one substantive to the other or some more
circumstantial kind of epexegetical addition would be expected.

2. The principal kinds of apposition in Hebrew are:—

(a) The collocation of genus and species, e.g. ???????? ?????? a woman (who was) a
widow, 1 K 7:14; ??????? ???????? a damsel (that is) a virgin, Dt 22:23, 28, Ju 4:4, 19:1,
21:12, 1 S 30:17, 1 K 1:2; cf. Gn 13:8, 21:20 (where, however, ?????? is probably an
explanatory gloss); Ex 24:5 (1 S 11:15), 2 S 15:16, 1 K 3:16, 5:29 (but probably
??????
should be read instead of ?????); Is 3:24 (unless ? ??????? is to be read), Jer 20:1. Perhaps
also ?????? ????? the priest (who is) the chief man, 2 K 25:18, &c.; others take ????? as

3 3 Cf. Na 2:9 ???? ??????, usually explained to mean from the days that she hath been,
but the text is evidently very corrupt.
4 4 So also Is 28:16 a corner stone of the preciousness (??????? is a substantive not an

2. When the nota accusativi ( ??? , ????) or a preposition precedes the first substantive, it
may be repeated before the noun in apposition, e.g. Gn 4:2, 22:2, 24:4, 47:29, Is 66:21; this
usually occurs when the nearer definition precedes a proper name. As a rule, however, the
repetition does not take place (Dt 18:1, Jer 33:18, 1 S 2:14). A noun in apposition is made
determinate, even after a noun with a prefix, in the ordinary way, e.g. 2 Ch 12:13
 ???
?? ????????
?
?????? in Jerusalem, the city which, &c.1

3. Sometimes a second adjective is used in apposition to a preceding adjective, in order to
 a white-reddish

modify in some way the meaning of the first, e.g. Lv 13:19

4. Permutation is to be regarded as a variety of apposition. It is not complementary like

apposition proper (see a above), but rather defines the preceding substantive (or pronoun, see
below), in order to prevent any possible misunderstanding. This includes cases like Gn 9:4
with the life thereof (which is) the blood thereof; Ex 22:30, Dt 2:26, 1 S 7:9, 2 K 3:4 an
hundred thousand rams, the wool, i.e. the wool of the rams; Jer 25:15 this cup of the wine,
that is of fury (but ???????? is probably a gloss); Is 42:25 he poured upon him fury, namely his
anger; 2 but especially the examples in which such a permutative is added to a preceding
pronoun, viz.—

(a) To a separate pronoun, e.g. Ex 7:11; with regard to the vocative, cf. § 126 f.

(b) To an accusative suffix, e.g. Ex 2:6 she saw him, the child (unless ???????? be a later
gloss); Ex 35:5, Lv 1357 b, 1 K 19:21 (where, indeed, ? ?????? appears to be a late gloss); 21:13, 2

1 1 In 1 K 11:8 participles after ?? ??????????, as in 2 K 10:6 after ?????? ???????????, in 19:2
after a determinate accusative, and in Hag 1:4 after ???????????, are used without the
article; these, however, are probably to be explained not as in apposition, but
according to § 118 p.
2 2But

 Gn 6:17 (cf. 7:6) is to be regarded as a later gloss upon the archaic ?????.

??(cid:31)???

K 16:15 Keth., Jer 9:14, 31:2, Ez 3:21, Ec 2:21 (according to Delitzsch rather a double
accusative).3

?????? ?

(c) To a noun-suffix, e.g. Ez 10:3

?????
(?), Ez 3:12; so also after a preposition with suffix, e.g. Ec 4:10 ???????? ?? ??? woe to him, the
one alone; with a repetition of the preposition, Nu 32:33, Jos 1:2 ????? ???? ??????? ????? to them, to the
children of Israel; Ju 21:7, Jer 51:56, Ez 42:5 (?), Dn 11:11, 1 Ch 4:42, 2 Ch 26:14.1—Cf.
finally, Ct 3:7, where the suffix precedes the genitive periphrastically expressed by ?? ??, as in
Ez 9:1, where the genitive is expressed by ??.2

 when he went in, the man; 42:14; cf. Pr 13:4

Of a different kind are the cases in which the permutative with its proper suffix follows as
a kind of correction of the preceding suffix, e.g. Is 29:23 when he (or rather) his children see,
&c. (but ???????? is clearly a gloss); cf. Ps 83:12; in Jb 29:3 read ????????? (infin. Hiph.) or at least
its syncopated form ??????.

5. Cases of apposition in a wider sense are those in which the nearer definition added to
the noun was originally regarded as an adverbial accusative; on its use with the verb and on
the relative correctness of speaking of such an accusative in Hebrew, cf. § 118 a and m.
Owing to the lack of case-endings, indeed, it is in many instances only by analogies elsewhere
(especially in Arabic) that we can decide whether the case is one of apposition in the narrower
or in the wider sense; in other instances this must remain quite uncertain. However, the
following are probably cases of apposition in the wider sense:—

(a) Such phrases as

????

?? ??? ????

 a double amount in money, Gn 43:15; cf. Jer 17:18; 1 S

17:5 five thousand shekels in brass, but this might also be taken (as in d) shekels which were
brass; certainly such cases as Jb 15l0 older than thy father in days, and the expression of the
superlative by means of ????? (originally a substantive), e.g. ????? ??? very good, Gn 1:31 (cf.
also Ec 7:16 ??????? ?????? righteous over much), and the very frequent ????? ??????? prop. a much-
making exceedingly, i.e. exceedingly great, Gn 15:1, 41:49, also Pr 23:29 ????? ???????? wounds
without cause, 3 perhaps also Gn 34:25 (

?????? ).

(b) A few examples, in which an epexegetical substantive is added to a substantive with a
suffix; thus, Ez 16:27 ????? ?????????? of thy conduct in lewdness (but it is also possible to explain it
(as in c) of thy conduct, which is lewdness); cf. Ez 24:13, 2 S 22:33
strength, i.e. my strong fortress (cf., however, Ps 18:33); Hb 3:8, Ps 71:7. While even in these
examples the deviation from the ordinary usage of the language (cf. § 135 n) is strange, it is
much more so in ??? ????????? Ez 18:7, i.e. according to the context his pledge for a debt; Ezr
2:62 ?? ????????????? ???????, i.e. their register, namely of those that were reckoned by genealogy (but

3 3 For ?? ?????? 1 S 21:14 either’ ??? ?????? is to be read or the Keth?(cid:31)bh is to be explained
according to § 75 b, note. Also ?????????? Pr 5:22 has hardly preserved the correct form.
1 1 But in Is 17:6 we should certainly divide the words differently and read  ?????????
??????????, in Jer 48:44 read ????? for
, and in Pr 14:13 ?????????? ????????; in Gn 2:19
????? ???
 is a late gloss upon ??, and in Ez 41:25 ????????? ??????????? a gloss on ????????.
2 2 Some of the examples given above are textually (or exegetically) doubtful, whilst
in the case of others, especially those from the later Books, we cannot help asking
whether such a prolepsis of the genitive by means of a suffix (as e.g. Ez 10:3) is not
due to the influence of Aramaic, in which it is the customary idiom; cf. Kautzsch’s
Gramm. des Biblisch-Aram., § 81 e and § 88.
3 3 In Ps 69:5 ????? (like
??(cid:31)???
adverbial accusative with a participle; cf. § 118 q.

 in a false way, falsely, Ps 35:19 and 38:20) is used as an

perhaps ???????? is in apposition to the suffix in ???????), also the curious combinations (mentioned
in § 128 d) of ???????? with a proper name (Lv 26:42), and in Jer 33:20 with ?????.4

6. In Dt 33:4 (? ???????, perhaps ????????? ???? is to be read), 33:27 (???????), Ju 7:8 (?????), the

absolute state appears to be used instead of the construct to govern a following logical
genitive; this, however, cannot be explained either as a special kind of apposition, or (with
Hitzig) as a peculiarity of the dialect of Northern Palestine, but is merely a textual corruption.
On the other hand, in Jb 31:11 ???? is evidently intended to combine the readings ????????? ???? and
???????? ???? (as in verse 28).—The remarkable combination ??????? ???????? in Ps 80:8, 15 is due to
the fact that in ?? 42–83 ???????? has almost throughout been subsequently substituted by some
redactor for the divine name ????; on ??????? ???? cf. § 125 h. In Ps 59:6, 80:5, 20, and 84:9 ????
has been reinstated in the text before ??????? ????????.1

7. Lastly, the nearer definition (qualification) of a noun may be effected by means of a
preposition (either with a suffix or with an independent noun), but must then be distinguished
from the cases in which the preposition is dependent on a verb or verbal idea, e.g. Gn 3:6 and
she gave also ????? ? ??????? unto her husband with her (= her husband who was with her); in Gn
9:16 (that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of
all flesh) and other places, the qualification of the noun is itself also qualified.

§ 132. Connexion of the Substantive with the Adjective.2

1. The adjective (like the participle used adjectivally), which serves as an attribute
of a substantive, stands after the substantive, and agrees with it in gender and number,
e.g. ????? ???? a great man, ????? ?????? a beautiful woman. If the substantive is
immediately connected with a genitive, the attribute follows the latter, since,
according to § 89 and § 128 a, the construct state and the genitive belonging to it are
inseparably united, e.g. Est 8:15
attribute when attached to a determinate substantive, see above, § 126 u.

 a great crown of gold.— On the

??????? ????? ???

?????

Rem. 1. Where an adjectival attribute appears to stand before its substantive (according to

the usual explanation, for the sake of special emphasis) the relation is really appositional in

4 4 But in Nu 25:12 ??? ?? may also be explained, according to c, as really in
apposition. Cf. on the whole question Delitzsch, Psalmen, 4th ed., p. 203, note 1.
1 1 Without this assumption it would be inconceivable that ??????? ??????? ???? should not
have been written; that the anther of these Psalms regarded ???????? already as an
independent name of God (so Gesenius and Olshausen) is out of the question.
2 2 On the expression of attributive ideas by substantives, cf. above, § 127 h, and §
128 o, with the note; § 135 n and § 141 c (substantives for adjectives as predicates of
noun-clauses) and § 152 u (periphrases for negative qualities). On the use of the
feminine of adjectives (and participles) to express abstract ideas, see § 122 q. It
remains to mention further the employment (mostly only in poetry) of certain epithets
in place of the substantives to which the quality in question belongs; e.g. ????? the
strong one, i.e. God; ????? the strong one, i.e. the bull (in Jer 8:16, &c., the horse); ???
swift=the runner (of the horse, Is 30:16); ??????? alba, i.e, luna; ???????? (fructifera) a
fruitful tree, Is 17:6 (so ????? Gn 49:22); ????? a croucher, i.e. a crouching beast of
prey, Gn 4:7. Cf. also ????? (gravis, augustus) and ?? ???? (elatus ?), i.e. a prince. The use
of adjectives and participles for substantives is much more extensive in Arabic. In
Greek and Latin poetical language cf. such examples as ???? = the sea; merum for
vinum, &c.

character; thus, Is 10:30 ??????? ??????? O thou poor one, Anathoth! (but probably
is to be read); cf. 23:12, 53:11 (a righteous man, my servant; but in 28:21 ??? and ??????? are
predicates preceding the substantives); Jer 3:6, 10 f., Ps 18:4 him who is worthy to be praised
will I call upon the Lord; 92:12 (apposition after participles).—But ?????? and ????? many, are
sometimes placed, like numerals, before the substantive, Jer 16:16, Neh 9:28 (in Ps 145:7 ???
is a subst. regens, in 89:51 the text is corrupt); an appositional relation can scarcely be
intended in these instances.

 answer her,

????????

2. In a few expressions (mostly poetic) the adjective appears not as an attribute after the

substantive, but in the construct state governing it; so in the singular, Ex 15:16 (unless ?????
should be read); 1 S 16:7 (the height of his stature); in the plural, 1 S 17:40 ???????? ??????? smooth
ones of (among) stones, i.e. smooth stones; Is 35:9, Ez 7:24, Ps 46:5, and with a following
collective instead of a plural, e.g. Is 29:19 ???? ????????? the poor among men, i.e. poor men; Jer
49:20, Zc 11:7; cf. in Latin canum degeneres. However, in almost all these cases the adjective
which is made into a regens is strongly emphatic, and is frequently equivalent to a superlative
(see below, § 133 g).

3. When two adjectives follow a feminine, sometimes only that standing next to the noun
takes the feminine termination, e.g. 1 K 19:11 ???? ??????? ??????? ???? (but read ?????); 1 S 15:9 (but
cf. § 75 y); Jer 20:9, Ps 63:2. A similar dislike of the feminine form may also be observed in
the case of verbal predicates referring to feminine subjects, cf. § 145 p and t.

When an attribute qualifies several substantives of different genders, it agrees with the
masculine, as being the prior gender (cf. § 146 d), e.g. Neh 9:13 ?????? ??????? ??????; Jer 34:9, Zc
8:5.

When three attributes follow a substantive, the first two may stand without a conjunction,

and the last be attached by w?w copulative, cf. Zc 1:8.

4. After feminines plural ending in ?? ?? (§ 87 p) the adjectival attribute (in accordance
with the fundamental rule stated above, under a) takes the ending  ?? , e.g. Is 10:14 ??????? ???????
forsaken eggs; Gn 32:16. For a strange exception see Jer 29:17 (differently in 24:2).

5. With regard to number it is to be remarked that—

(a) Substantives in the dual are followed by adjectives (or participles) in the plural, e.g.

Ps 18:28 (Pr 6:17)

????? ???

??????

 haughty eyes; Is 35:3, Jb 4:3 f., cf. § 88 a.

(b) Collective ideas are not infrequently joined with the plural of the adjective or
participle (constructio ad sensum); thus, e.g. ???? sheep [with fem. plur.], Gn 30:43, 1 S
25:18; ???=men, 1 S 13:15, Is 9:1; ????? ????????=all the Israelites, 1 S 2:14; ?????=the exiles, Jer
 two souls, Gn 46:27.1 Cf. similar phenomena in the connexion of
28:4; cf. also
???
collectives with plural predicates in § 145 c.

?? ?? ???

????

(c) The pluralis excellentiae or pluralis maiestatis is joined, as a rule, to the singular of
the attribute, e.g. Ps 7:10 ?????? ????????; 2 K 19:4, 16 (=Is 37:4, 17); Is 19:4; but cf. ?????? ????????2

1 1 But it is impossible to take ???????? in Ez 46:6 as an attribute of ?????; probably it is a
correction intended to harmonize the passage with Nu 28:11 where two young
bullocks are required.
2 2 Cf. 1 S 28:13, where ???????? (in the sense of a spirit) is followed by ?????? as a
second accusative; conversely in 1 S 19:13, 16, a singular suffix refers back to ????????

Dt 5:23, 1 S 17:26, 36, Jer 10:10, 23:36, perhaps also Ex 20:3 ???????? ????????= another god, and
Jos 24:19 ?? ????? ???????? (but cf. above, § 124 g–k). On the other hand, 1 S 4:8 is to be
explained as having been said by the Philistines, who supposed that the Israelites had several
gods. On the connexion of ???????? with a plural predicate, see § 145 i.

2. On the adjective (in the construct state) governing a following genitive, see §

128 x; for the participle in the same construction, see § 116 f–l.

§ 133. The Comparison of Adjectives. (Periphrastic Expression of the Comparative
and Superlative.)

A. Wünsche, ‘Der Komparativ im Hebr. im Lichte der arab. Gramm., ’ in
Vierteljahrsschrift für Bibelkunde, 1904, p. 398 ff.

1. Hebrew possesses no special forms either for the comparative or superlative of

the adjective.1 In order to express a comparative, the person or thing which is to be
represented as excelled in some particular quality is attached to the attributive word
by the preposition ???? ( ?? · ), e.g. 1 S 9:2 ??????????? ?????? higher than any of the people. The
fundamental idea evidently is, tall away from all the people (beyond all the people);
cf. Ju 14:18 ???????? ??? ???? ??????? ????????? what is sweeter than honey? and what is
stronger than a lion? Ez 28:3, Am 6:2 Frequently an infinitive appears as the object
of the comparison, e.g. Gn 29:19 it is better that I give her to thee, than that I should,
give her, &c.; Ex 14:12, Ps 118:8f.2

Rem. 1. This use of ???? is also very common when the attributive idea is represented by
an intransitive verb, e.g. 1 S 10:23 ??????????? ????????? and he was higher than any of the people; Na
3:8. Jb 7:6. Elsewhere, especially after transitive verbs, ???? rather represents (on its different
senses see § 119 v–z) the idea of a separation, distinction or superiority of one person or
thing from or over others.1 This is evident in such cases as ???? ????? to choose something (to
prefer it) before something else, e.g. Jb 7:15, cf. Dt 14:2 (also

 the excellence of …

 ???????

????

 ...

household god (but not so in Gn 31:34), as in Ps 46:4 to the plural of amplification
?????? sea. On the other hand, it is very doubtful whether ????? Ps 78:15 is to be regarded
as an attribute of ??????? and not rather as the adverb, abundantly.
1 1 There is in Arabic a special form of the adjective (the elative) for the comparative
and superlative, which in Hebrew would have the form ??????. Instances of it, perhaps,
are ?????? daring, cruel, ?????? deceptive (of a brook drying up), and its opposite ??????
(contracted from ’aitan) constantly flowing, perennis. These forms are, however, used
without any perceptible emphasis, and cannot be regarded as more than isolated relics
of an elative formation which has become obsolete, much as the Latin comparative
disappears in Italian, and still more so in French, and is supplanted by the
circumlocution with più, plus.
2 2 In Ju 11:25 the adjective is specially intensified by repetition, art thou so much
better than Balak? It would also be possible, however, to translate art thou really
better …?
1 1 Cf. the Latin ablative with the comparative; also the etymology of such words as
eximius, egregius, and the Homeric ?? ?????? µ??????, Il. 4, 96; ?? ???????, 18, 431.

over …, Ec 2:13); it is also seen in examples like Gn 37:3 ???????????? ????????? ???? ????? ?????? now
Israel loved Joseph more than all his (other) children; 29:30, 1 S 2:29, Ho 6:6.2

2. A somewhat different idea underlies the use of ???? after adjectives, or intransitive verbs

?????

?????

possessing an attributive sense, when the thought to be expressed is that the quality is too
little or too much in force for the attainment of a particular aim or object, e.g. Is 7:13 ????? ???????
is it a small thing (i.e. too little) for you to …? Jb 15:11; after an intransitive verb, e.g. Gn
32:11 I am too insignificant (
) for all the mercies (I am not worthy of …), &c.; cf. also
the expressions ???? ????? to be too heavy for one, Ex 18:18, Nu 11:14, Ps 38:5; ???? ? ???? to be too
hard for one, Dt 1:17; ???? ????? to be too few for something, Ex 12:4; ???? ????? to be too strong
for one, Ps 65:4; ???? ????? to be too mighty for one, Gn 26:16; ???? ??? to be too high for one, Ps
61:3; ???? ??? to be too narrow for one, Is 49:19; ???? ????? to be too short for something, Is 50:2,
and very frequently ???? ??????? to be too wonderful for one (and, consequently, inconceivable or
unattainable), Gn 18:14, Dt 17:8, 30:11, Jer 37:17, Pr 30:18; in Ps 139:6 ??????? in the same
sense is followed by ???.—This use is especially seen in the numerous instances in which the
attribute is followed by ???? with an infinitive e.g. 1 K 8:64 the brazen altar … was ????????? ?????
too little to receive (to be able to receive) the burnt offering, cf. Gn 4:13, 36:7 too great for
them to dwell together; after verbs, e.g. Ex 12:4, Is 28:20, Ps 40:6. Finally, cf. ???? ????? ???,
followed by the infinitive, it is enough (prop. too much) for you to …, meaning ye have …
long enough, 1 K 12:28; cf. Ex 9:28 and Ez 44:6 (???? followed by a substantive).3

In all these instances ???? expresses either the removal of a thing from a person, or the
severance of the person from some aim or object; cf. also the expression ???? ??? ????? ????????????
nothing will be unattainable for them (prop. there shall not be cut off from them anything
which, &c.), (Gn 11:6, Jb 42:3.

3. The attributive idea, on which ???? logically depends, must sometimes, in consequence

of a pregnant use of the ???? (see the analogous examples in § 119 ff), be supplied from the
context, e.g. Is 10:10
 whose graven images were more numerous than those
at Jerusalem, &c.;4 Mi 7:4 worse than a thorn hedge; Ps 62:10 lighter than a breath; Jb 11:17
clearer than the noonday; Ec 4:17 better than, &c.

?? ???????? ????????????

????

2. The correlative comparatives greater—less (older—younger) are expressed by

the simple adjective with the article (the great, equivalent to the greater, &c.); Gn
1:16, 19:31, 34, 27:15, 29:16, 18, 26.

3. To express the superlative it is also sufficient (see above, f) to make the
adjective determinate, either by means of the article or a following partitive genitive
(or suffix); in this case the article or genitive indicates that the attribute in question
belongs especially to one or more definite individuals;1 e. g. 1 S 9:21 ????????? the least;
16:11 ??????? the little one, i.e. the youngest of eight sons; 17:14 David was ??????? the

2 2 On the other hand, the phrase ???? ????? expresses not a comparison, but only a
relation existing between one person and another; thus, in Gn 38:26
???? ????????
means, she is in the right as against me; cf. Ps 139:12, Jb 4:17, 32:2.—In Pr 17:12
rather (to meet with so and so) than … is expressed by ????? before the second
member.
3 3 Cf. also 2 K 4:3, where the idea of doing something too little is paraphrased by the
Hiph. ???????? = do not too little, sc. ??? ???? in borrowing empty vessels.
4 4 With this comparatio decurtata, cf. the still bolder pregnant construction in Ps 4:8,
????? greater gladness than at the time, &c.
1 1 Cf. also ??????? the one above, i.e. the Most High.

(cid:31)???

youngest, and the three great, i.e. elder, &c.; Gn 42:13, 44:2, Ct 1:8.—So also with a
qualifying adjective, e. g. Gn 9:24 ??????? ???? his youngest son; cf. Jos 14:15; also with a
following genitive, 2 Ch 21:17 ?????? ????? the youngest of his sons: Pr 30:24 the least
upon the earth; with suffix, Mi 7:4 ????? their good one, i.e. the best of them; Jan 3:5
????????????? ????????? from the greatest of them even to the least of them; cf. the inverse
order in Jer 6:13, 31:34.

Rem. 1. The above examples apply only to the most common relative attributes (great,

small, good), and to expressions which by usage easily came to be recognized as periphrases
for the superlative. Other adjectives, however, when followed by a partitive genitive, also
acquire the sense of a superlative; this appears from the context, e. g. Dt 33:19 the most
hidden treasures of the sand; Ju 5:29 the wisest amongst her ladies; Is 14:30, 19:11, 23:8 f.,
29:19, Jer 49:20, Ez 28:7, Zc 11:7, Ps 45:13, Jb 30:6 (in the most horrible of valleys), 41:22;
probably also Ps 35:16. On this government by the adjective generally, cf. § 132 c.—
Moreover, the combination of a substantive in the construct state with an adjective used
substantivally (§ 128 w) sometimes serves as a periphrasis for the superlative, e. g. Is 22:24
??????? ????? ??? all the smallest vessels. On Ct 7:10 see § 126 x.

2. Other periphrases for the superlative are the use of a substantive in the construct state
before the plural of the same word (which is naturally to be regarded as a partitive genitive;
cf. our book of books), e. g. Ex 26:33 ?? ???????? ????? the most holy place; ?????????? ?? ?? (Ct 1:1)
the most excellent song; cf. Gn 9:25 (= servus servorum, the lowest servant); Nu 3:32, Dt
10:17 (Ps 136:2, 3)2; 1 K 8:27, Is 34:10 (cf. Gal 1:5, Rev 22:5); Jer 3:19, Ez 16:7, 26:7 (king
of kings, of Nebuchadrezzar; cf. 1 Tim 6:15, Rev 17:14, 19:16, and another kind of
periphrasis in Ps 95:3); Ec 1:2. Similarly in Jer 6:28 two participles are combined, and in Ho
10:15 two substantives in the singular. Finally, the same object is attained by connecting one
substantive in the construct state with another of the same stem (????? ?? ??? ?? a sabbath of
solemn rest, i.e. an obligatory day of rest, Ex 31:15, &c.) or of the same meaning (e. g.
??????? a thick darkness, Ex 10:22).

 ?? ??

??

3. The intensification of attributes by means of repetition belongs rather to rhetoric than
to syntax, e. g. Ec 7:24 ????? ????? exceeding deep; 1 S 2:3, Pr 20:14; the adjective is even used
three times in Is 6:3.—Cf. the repetition of adverbs for the same purpose in Gn 7:19, Nu 14:7
(????? ????? exceedingly, also ????? ??????? Ex 1:7, &c.); Ez 42:15.—On the other hand, in Dt
28:43 the repetition expresses a continuous progress, higher and higher … lower and lower;
in Dt 2:27 (see § 123 e) and 16:20 (nothing but justice) the constancy of the action. Cf. Ex
23:30 ????? ????? little by little, very gradually.1

The repetition of substantives serves also as a periphrasis for the superlative in such cases

as ??? ????? (Ex 3:15) = to the remotest generations; cf. 17:16, Jer 6:14, 8:11 (perfect peace);
Ez 21:32 (????? three times);2 35:7, Na 1:2; cf. also Ho 2:21 f. and the emphatic combination of
synonymous verbs in Is 33:10. Sometimes the completeness of an action or state is expressed
by placing together two or even three substantives of the same stem and of similar sound, cf.
Is 22:5, Ez 6:14 (3328 f., 35:3); 32:15, Na 2:11, Zp 1:15 (Jb 30:3, 38:27).

2 2 God 1of gods, and Lord of lords, just as the supreme god of the Babylonians is
called b?l b?l? (Tiele, Compend. der Rel.-Gesch., p. 87).
1 1 Adverbs of the same stem are connected in this way in Nu 6:9, Is 29:5, 30:13; of
different stems in Is 5:26 and Jo 4:4. In Nu 12:2 the particles ??? ??? appear to be
placed together for a similar purpose, equivalent to simply and solely.
2 2 Different in kind from the triple utterance of the same words in 2 S 18:33, Jer 7:4
and 22:29, and the double exclamation in Jer 4:19 and La 1:16 (?).

§ 134. Syntax of the Numerals.

Cf. the exhaustive statistics collected by Sven Herner, Syntax der Zahlwörter im A. T.,
Lund, 1893. E. König, ‘Zur Syntax der Zahlwörter im A. T.,’ AJSL. xviii, 129 ff.

1. The numerals from 2 to 10, as being originally abstract substantives,3 may be
connected with their substantives in three different ways. They may stand either—

(a) In the construct state before the substantive (the object numbered being
consequently in the genitive), e. g. ?????? ? ??? ?? a triad of days, i.e. three days;  ??? ??
?? ????????? the two men; or

(b) In the absolute state before it (the object numbered being in apposition, § 131

d), e. g. ?????? ? ??? ?? a triad, viz. sons, i. e. three sons;

?? ?????? ???

?? ???

 two men; or

(c) In the absolute state (likewise in apposition) after the object numbered, e. g.
??? ?? ?????. So especially in long lists, since in these the substantives naturally come
first, e. g. Gn 32:15. Nu 7:17, 28:19. Apart from such cases, the frequency of this
order in the later Books is due to the fact that the character of the numeral tended
more and more to become adjectival rather than substantival.4

Rem. In Lv 24:22 ????? follows the construct state ??? ????, but here as in Nu 15:16 ??? ????
should be read. In Gn 42:19 ????? is in apposition to a substantive with a suffix (= one of you
brethren; but verse 33 the one of you brethren). In Nu 31:28  ?????
 precedes the substantive in
the Aramaic manner (= one each).—For ??? ???????? (Gn 17:17, &c.) we find regularly in the
Priestly Code (except in Gn 17:17, 23:1) ??? ?? ???? (Gn 5:3, &c.) an hundred years. On the
connexion of abstract numerals with suffixes, as ?????? ?? their duality, i.e. they two, Gn 2:25,
&c. (also with a strengthening separate pronoun, as

 1 S 20:42), cf. § 97 i.

????

2. The numerals from 2 to 10 take the object numbered in the plural,1 with very
few exceptions, such as Ex 16:22 (where
????
2:21, Ez 45:1, cf. 2 K 8:17 and 25:17 Keth. The numerals from 11 to 19 generally take
the plural, but with certain substantives frequently used with numerals the singular is
more common (see further, under f). The tens (from 20 to 90), when they precede,
take the singular (in the accusative, cf. § 131 p) of certain nouns frequently used with

 = the double of an omer), 2 K

???? ??? ??

3 3 Cf. § 97 a, where it is shown that the masculine is the original form of the
numerals (used for both genders), and that the feminine was afterwards differentiated
and used with masc. nouns, primarily in the second decade and then in the first as
well.
4 4 From Herner’s tables (op. cit., pp. 55–66) it appears, according to p. 68, that in the
documents J, E, D of the Pentateuch, and in Jos 1–12, Judges, Samuel, Isaiah,
Jeremiah, the Minor Prophets, Psalms, Megilloth, and Job, the numeral never, or very
rarely, stands after its noun; in Kings and Ezekiel it stands several times after; in the
Priestly Code nearly always after; in Chronicles, Ezra, Nehemiah, and Daniel, nearly
as often after as before the noun. In Ex 28:10 the Masora makes the numeral in the
genitive follow the construct state of the substantive numbered; we should, however,
read ????????? ??? ????????; for the omission of the article before ??, cf. § 126 w.
1 1 On examples such as Gn 46:27 (

joined with the plural of the adjective).

numerals (
Priestly Code), otherwise the plural, as ??????, ?????, ?????? (but cf. also Ju 11:33), &c.; on
the other hand, the plural is necessary when they follow the object numbered in
apposition (e. g. ???? ???? ???? twenty cubits, 2 Ch 3:3 f.; with the exception of 2 S 24:24,
only in late Books). After ???? and
in the singular or plural, see further under g.

??????  the substantive numbered may be used either

?????? —but only in Ezekiel and the

 month, ???? city,

??????  soul (person),

Rem. 1. After the numerals from 11 to 19 the singular is used, as a rule, with ??? day, ??? ??
??????  tribe, ??????? pillar (Ex 24:4), sometimes with ???? cubit,
??????  shekel (compare our four-year-old, ten pound), e. g. Dt 1:2  ? ???? ????

year, ???? man,
??????
??? (cf., however, such exceptions as Dt 1:23, Jos 4:2, &c.).—Substantives other than these
are used in the plural with the numerals from 11 to 19, and the numeral may even follow the
substantive, especially in later passages, as Nu 7:87 f., 1 Ch 4:27, 25:5.

2. After ???? (???? [so almost exclusively in the Priestly Code, e. g. always

18:25, 2 S 16:1, 1 K 18:4; after ???? Ex 38:27; after ????? Ju 15:4, 2 S 8:4, 1 K 10:17, Ez

3. Numerals compounded of tens and units (like 21, 62) take the object numbered
 two

??? ?? ????? ???? ???
and sixty years (??? ?? in the singular, according to e, since it conforms to the ten
immediately preceding; but also ??? ?? ????? ??? ?? ??? ?? Dt 2:14), or before them in the
plural, especially in the later Books, Dn 9:26, &c.; or the object is repeated (but only
in 1 K 6:1, and the Priestly Code; sometimes even several times, e. g. Gn 23:1, 25:7,
17 thrice) in the plural with the units, and in the singular with the tens and hundreds,
?? ????
e. g. Gn 12:4 ??? ?? ?????? ???? ???? ?? ????? seventy and five years; Gn 23:1
 an hundred and twenty and seven years. Cf. Gn 5:6 ff.

Rem. 1. It may further be remarked with regard to the order, that the thousand or

thousands always precede the hundreds, &c., and the hundreds almost always come before the
smaller numbers (in Kings and Ezekiel sometimes, and in the Priestly Code usually, after the
smaller numbers), the tens in the earlier Books (documents J and D of the Pentateuch, in
Joshua 1–12, Judges, Samuel, Isaiah, and also in Ezra and Nehemiah) before the units, but in
Jeremiah, Ezekiel, the Priestly Code, Joshua 13–24 after the units (see Herner, op. cit., p. 73).
After the hundreds the smaller number is very frequently added without ??, especially in Ezra,
Nehemiah, and Daniel.

On the syntax of the cardinals in general:—

2. The cardinals are determined by the article, when they refer back (without being
connected with the object numbered; cf., however, Lv 25:10 f., Nu 16:35, Jos 4:4, 2 S 23:13)
to a number or list already mentioned, e. g. Gn 2:11 ?????? ???????? ? ?? the name of the one (the
first) is Pishon; Gn 14:9 four kings against the five (enumerated in verse 2); cf. 1 Ch 11:20 f.,
and the determinate tens in Gn 18:29, 31 f. A demonstrative with the article may also be

added to a numeral determined in this way, e. g. Dt 19:9 (but cf. also Gn 9:19, 22:23, where
the numeral and demonstrative are practically determinate in themselves). In the case of the
numerals from 11 to 19 the article may stand either before the unit (1 Ch 25:19, 27:15) or
before ? ???? (Jos 4:4); it is used before all three members of a compound number (273) in Nu
3:46.

In apposition with any determinate substantive the cardinal number is used without the
article, not only when it precedes the substantive, as in Jos 15:14 (???????? ????? ? ???? ??????, where
? ???? ?? is equivalent to a substantive determinate in itself; cf. Gn 18:28, Jos 6:8, 22 1 S 17:14,
1 K 11:31, and the passages discussed above in § 126 x, Gn 21:29, &c.), but also when it
follows the substantive, e. g. 1 K 7:27, 43 f. ? ???? and ??? ????; the omission of the article may
here, as in the eases noticed in § 126 z, be also due to the dislike of a hiatus, but cf. also
?? ??????
2 K 25:16 after a determinate substantive. The fact that it is by nature determinate would also
be a very simple explanation of ????? Nu 28:4, 1 S 13:17 f., Jer 24:2, Ez 10:9, instead of the
more usual ????????, and of ???? 1 S 1:2 for ???????.

Such cases as ???????? ????? ?? Ju 14:17 (which is determined by a following determinate
genitive) are explained from § 127 b; 1 Ch 9:25 perhaps from § 126 q; in Is 30:26 probably
the light of all the seven days of the week is meant; on the other hand, in 1 S 9:20 and 25:38
the article is, with Wellhausen, to be omitted.

3. Certain specifications of measure, weight, or time, are commonly omitted after

???

????

?? ???

 two (sc. loaves, see verse 3) of bread, cf. 17:17

 a thousand (shekels) of silver; so also before ????? Gn 24:22,

numerals, e. g. Gn 20:16
1 K 10:16, Is 7:23, cf. Ps 119:72. Moreover, Ru 3:15 ?????? ?? ? ?? six (ephahs) of barley; 1 S
10:4
????
before
 a measure, or perhaps some term like cakes, is to be supplied.—The number of
cubits is stated in the Priestly Code (Ex 26:2, &c.) and in 1 K 6 and 7 (otherwise only in Ez
40:5, 21, 47:3. Zc 5:2, 1 Ch 11:23, 2 Ch 4:2 f.) by the addition of ??????? prop. by the cubit.
Also in Ex 27:11 the Samaritan and LXX read ??????? after ??????, and in 27:15 ???? after ??? ????.

; 2 S 16:1, where

?????? ??

????

4. The ordinals above 10 have no special forms, but are expressed by the
corresponding cardinals, which may then stand either before or after the object
numbered, e. g. Gn 7:11 ??? ? ???? ???? ???? on the seventeenth day; Dt 1:3 ??? ?? ??????????? in
the fortieth year; cf. Gn 14:5, 2 K 25:27, and, with repetition of ??? ?? in a compound
number, 1 K 6:1; such a cardinal occurs without ?? (and therefore in the accus.
temporis, according to § 118 k) in Gn 14:4 (the Samaritan, however, has ?????); with
the article (but without a numbered object, see under k), 1 K 19:19.1—On the position
of the numeral as a genitive following its noun, cf. e. g. 1 K 16:10 ??? ???? ???? ???? ??? ???? in
the twenty and seventh year, and with a determinate numeral, Ex 12:18, Nu 33:38, Dt
15:9. In this case, however, ??? ?? is very frequently repeated, e. g. Gn 7:11, 2 K 13:10;
after a determinate numeral, Lv 25:10.2

1 1 Somewhat different from this is Ex 19:15 be ready
 prop. after three
days, i.e. on the third day (in verses 11 and 16 and in Ezr 10:8 the ordinal is used),
also 1 S 30:13 ? ??? ?? ????? ???????? ??? because three days agone I fell sick, prop. to-day
three (days).
2 2 All these expressions may indeed be explained by supposing that, e. g. in Lv
25:10, the proper meaning is the year of the fifty years which it completed, i.e. the
fiftieth year; but it is more correct to regard ??? ?? or ??? ???? in such cases not as a real

?????? ? ??

(cid:31)? ????

Rem. In numbering days of the month and years, the cardinals are very frequently used

????

????

 Zc 7:1;

instead of the ordinals even for the numbers from 1 to 10, e. g. ????? ?? ??? ???? 1 K 15:25;  ??? ????
?? ?? 2 K 18:1, &c., cf. Dt 15:9. The months themselves are always numbered by the ordinals
(????????, ????????, &c., up to ???? ???????), but not the days of the month, e. g.
???? ???????????
???? ??????????
&c.,
Lv 23:32 (always, however,
???? ???????
??? in all these cases see under n; only in late passages is ??? added, e. g. 2 Ch 29:17  ????? ?? ?????

be explained according to § 128 k. This is supported by the fact that the Masora on Jer 28:1,
32:1 requires in the Qerê ???????? for ????.

5. Distributives are expressed either by repetition of the cardinal number, e. g. Gn
 two and two; 2 S 21:20 ? ???? ? ?? six each; with the numbered object

7:9, 15
also repeated, e. g. Jos 3:12 ????????? ????? ???? ????? ???? for every tribe a man; Nu 13:2,
34:18 (??? ?????, as in Neh 11:1, one out of every ten); cf. § 123 d; or a periphrasis with
?? ????? is used, Nu 17:18, Dt 1:23, cf. Is 6:2 ??????? after six wings twice repeated; the
simple distributive ?? is, however, sufficient (as in ??????????, § 123 c), e. g. ????????????? ???????
by hundreds and by thousands.

6. The multiplicatives are expressed either (like the ordinals above 10, see under

in Ex 16:5 the double is expressed by ???? ??? ???? (prop. a repetition over and above that
which, &c.).—Of the ordinals ???? ?? is used as a numeral adverb, Gn 22:15, &c., a
second time, cf. the Latin tertium consul; ? ?????????? the third time, 1 S 3:8;
????? ???
fifth time, Neh 6:5; ??????????? at the seventh (time), 1 K 18:44, and

Rem. The collocation of a numeral with the next above it (either in the same or in

different sentences) is a rhetorical device employed in numerical sayings to express a number,

nomen regens, but simply as a connective form to be explained on the analogy of the
cases mentioned in § 128 k.

which need not, or cannot, be more exactly specified. It must be gathered from the context
whether such formulae are intended to denote only an insignificant number (e. g. Is 17:6, two
or at the most three), or a considerable number, e. g. Mi 5:4. Sometimes, however, this
juxtaposition serves to express merely an indefinite total, without the collateral idea of
intensifying the lower by means of the higher number. Thus one and two are connected by ??,
Dt 32:30, Jer 3:14, Jb 33:14, 40:5 (without ??, Ps 62:12); two and three, Is 17:6 (Sirac 23:16,

Pr 30:18, 21:29 (Sirac 26:5), and with out ??, Pr 30:15; four and five, without ??, Is 17:6; six and
seven, Jb 5:19, Pr 6:16; seven and eight, Mi 5:4, Ec 11:2; (nine and ten, Sirac 25:7).

1. The separate pronouns,—apart from their employment as the subject in noun-
clauses (cf. § 141 a) and the idiom mentioned under d–h, —are used, according to §
32 b, as a rule, only to give express emphasis to the subject; e. g. Gn 16:5, 2 S 24:17
??????? i.e. I myself, so also ????? 2 S 12:28, 17:15 (after the verb), Ez 34:15, Ps 2:6; 1 but 1
S 10:18, 2 S 12:7, Is 45:12 ??????? I and none else; cf. also ????? ????? I, I! Ho 5:14, &c.; ????
Gn 15:15, Ju 15:18, 1 S 17:56 (as in 20:8, 22:18, Ex 18:19, Dt 5:24, Ju 8:21, after the
imperative); 1 K 21:7; ???? Gn 9:7, Ex 20:19 (after the verb, Ju 15:12); fem. Gn 31:6;
??? 1 S 22:18; ???? Gn 3:20, Ju 14:3;
??????  Jer 5:5.—Sometimes, however, the separate
pronoun appears to be placed before the verb more on rhythmical grounds, i.e. in
order to give the statement a fuller sound than that of the bare verbal form (cf. the
similar use of the infinitive absolute, § 113 o). Thus Gn 14:23, Ps 139:2, and most
clearly in such passages as Gn 21:24, 47:30, Ex 8:24, Ju 6:18, 11:9, 1 S 12:20, 2 S
3:13, 21:6, 1 K 2:18 (in solemn promises). The same explanation applies to ????? at the
beginning of sentences, e. g. Gn 24:45, Ho 5:3, 10:11, 12:11, Ps 39:11, 82:6, Jb 5:3.2

Rem. 1. Different from this is the pleonastic addition of the separate pronoun immediately
after the verb (according to Delitzsch on Ct 5:5 perhaps a trace of popular language), e. g. 1 S
23:22(?), Ct 5:5, and (like other indications of the very late origin of the book) very
frequently in Ecclesiastes, e. g. 1:16, 2:1, 11, 15, 3:17f. and thirteen other places; in Aramaic,
Dn 5:16.

2. Substantival subjects also are somewhat frequently resumed, and thus expressly
emphasized, by the insertion of the corresponding separate pronoun of the 3rd person before
the predicate is stated, e. g. Gn 3:12 the woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she (????)

(cid:31)???

?? ??????????

1 1 Also ???, ???? he himself, she herself (of persons and things), e. g. Is 7:14 ??? ???????
 the Jews themselves. In the sense of the same
the Lord himself; Est 9:1
(? ?????) or (one and) the same, ??? is used in Is 41:4, 43:10, 13, 46:4, 48:12 (always
??? ?????), Ps 102:28 (??? ????), and probably also Jb 3:19.—The position of
, as an
accusative of the object, before a perfect in 1 Ch 9:22, can at most be explained on the
analogy of Aramaic (Ezr 5:12).
2 2 As early as the Mês(cid:31)a(cid:31) inscription (line 21 ff.) ??? frequently stands at the
beginning of a new sentence after the dividing stroke.

??(cid:31)???

gave me, &c.; 14:24 (???); 15:4, 24:7, &c.; but ??? in Is 7:14 after the predicate and subject is
equivalent to he himself.1

2. Not infrequently the separate pronoun serves to give strong emphasis to a suffix

of the same person which precedes (or sometimes even to one which follows),
whether the suffix be attached to a verb (as accusative) or to a noun or preposition (as
genitive). In English such an emphasis on the pronoun can generally be rendered only
by laying greater stress upon it, or sometimes by repeating it; cf., on the contrary, the
French mon livre à moi. The separate pronoun in such instances is not to be regarded
as casus obliquus (accusative or genitive), but as the subject of an independent
sentence, the predicate of which must in each case be supplied according to the
context.

Examples of emphasis:—

(a) On a verbal suffix by means of ????? ( ?????

) Gn 27:34

????

????? ???
???????
?

 bless me, even me also

(prop. bless me, I also would be blessed); Zc 7:5; cf. also Ez 6:3, 34:11, 20  ? ???????
(
????? ) Pr 22:19 (but the text is most probably corrupt).—The separate pronoun precedes in Gn
24:27 (???????); 49:8 (????, not Judah, thou art he whom, but Judah thee, thee thy brethren shall
praise!), and Ec 2:15 ????? ???.

; by ????

????

????

????? ???????????
?? ???

 thy blood, even thine; by ??? 2 S 17:5, Jer 27:7, Mi 7:3; by

(b) On a noun-suffix with a substantive, by means of ????? 2 S 19:1, Pr 23:15; by
????

?????  1 K
 1 S
?????
, but without special stress; Neh 5:2 (?); by ???? Nu 14:32; by ??? Ps 38:11
??????  Ps 9:7.—The separate pronoun precedes in Jb 21:4 (???????); Gn
?????? ).—In Ps 89:48,

21:19
20:42, after
???
(without special stress),
40:16, Is 45:12, 1 Ch 28:2 (?????); Zc 9:11 (???); Jos 23:9 (????); Ez 33:17 (
where ????? might be taken as strengthening ??? (equivalent in sense to ???????), we should read
??????? for ?????, as in verse 51.

???? ???

(c) On a suffix united with a preposition, 1 S 25:24 ????? ??? upon me, upon me; 1 K 1:26  ???
 not against thee; 1 S 19:23 ??? ??? ?????? upon him also; Dt 5:3
; 2 Ch 35:21
.—

 but with us, even us; Hag 1:4 ???? ????? for you yourselves; Jer 25:14
???

?????

????
???? ?????? ???

The separate pronoun precedes in 1 S 12:23
??????, and 2 Ch 28:10 ??????? ????.

????
; Mi 5:1

 ...

The same principle also explains Gn 4:26 ??????? ? ???? to Seth, to him also (not ??????); cf.

10:21, and Ex 35:34, Nu 4:22.

3. The oblique cases of the personal pronouns expressed by means of a preposition
(or the nots accus. ??) with a suffix may be used either in a demonstrative or reflexive
sense,1 as ?? to him, but also to himself, e. g. Ju 3:16 and Ehud made ?? for himself a
sword, cf. Gn 33:17; so also ????? sibi, Is 3:9; ?????? unto him, and Gn 8:9 unto himself;

1 1 Analogous to this is the resumption of a noun dependent on a preposition, by
means of a pronominal suffix united with the same preposition, e. g. Gn 2:17, 2 S
6:22, 2 K 22:18, or of an object by means of the nota accusativi ?? with suffix, e. g. 1
S 15:9 (where
1 1 As in Luther’s Bible jm (ihm), jr (ihr) for sich, and in our version him, her for
himself, herself.

 is certainly to be read), Is 8:13.

????????(cid:31)???

???? with him, and Gn 22:3 with himself; ????? with her, and 1 S 1:24 with herself; also
apparently as a pleonastic dativus ethicus (see § 119 s), Jb 12:11, 13:1.

Rarely, and only when marked emphasis is intended, is the accusative of the
reflexive pronoun represented by the nota accusativi ?? with a suffix (this being
ordinarily expressed by the reflexive conjugations Niph(cid:31)al and Hithpa(cid:31)?l2); thus,
????? se ipsos, Ex 5:19, Jer 7:19 in sharp antithesis to ????????; Ez 34:2, 8, 10. Cf. § 57 at
the end, together with note 2.

Rem. There is a similar emphasis in Is 49:26 on ??? ???? and ????? in the sense of their own

flesh, their own blood. On the sometimes demonstrative, sometimes reflexive meaning of
noun-suffixes of the 3rd person singular and plural, cf. § 91, p and q. For other
circumlocutions to express the idea of self, see § 139 f.

4. The possessive pronouns are, according to § 33 c, expressed by the suffixes of
the noun (in the genitive),3 which may represent either a subjective genitive, or (like
the genitives proper, § 128 h) an objective genitive, e. g. ??????? the wrong done against
me, Gn 16:5, Jer 51:35; cf. Gn 9:2, 18:21, 27:13 (2 S 16:12 Keth.); Gn 30:23, 39:21
 the treatment of him);
(cf. Ex 3:21, &c.); 50:4, Ex 20:20, 21:35, Ju 4:9, 13:12 (
Is 56:7, Jer 9:7, Na 3:19, Pr 1:27, 24:22, Jb 20:29, 23:14, 34:6. Cf. also such pregnant
expressions as Ps 20:3 ???????? ??? ???? he will send thy help (help for thee), i.e. he will send
thee help; Gn 30:18, 39:21, Ex 2:9, Is 1:26 (and I will restore judges for thee); Ez
37:15.

???????

???

When several substantives are co-ordinated, the pronominal suffix must be attached to
each singly, e. g. Gn 36:6 and Esau took ???????? ?????? ???????????? ?? ???????? his wives and his sons and
his daughters, &c.; 38:18, &c. In 2 S 23:5 the text is hardly correct.

5. When the genitive, following a construct state, is used periphrastically to
express the idea of a material or attribute (§ 128 o and p), the pronominal suffix,
which properly belongs to the compound idea (represented by the nomen regens and
genitive), is, like the article (§ 127), attached to the second substantive (the genitive),
e. g. ? ?????????? prop. the hill of my holiness, i.e. my holy hill, Ps 2:6, &c.; ?? ?????? ???? thy
holy city, Dn 9:24; ?????? ???????? his idols of silver, Is 2:20, 30:22, 31:7; 1 cf. Dt 1:41, Is
9:3, 28:4, 41:11, Ez 9:1f., Ps. 41:10, 150:1, Jb 18:7 ???? ???????? his steps of strength;
38:6; after an adjective as nomen regens, Is 13:3 (Zp 3:11) ?????????? ???????? my proudly
exulting ones.—On the same analogy is the use of e. g. ?????????? ????? Dt 1:41 his

2 2 Niph(cid:31)al according to § 51 e (like Hithpa(cid:31)?l according to § 54 f) may also include
the dative of the reflexive pronoun.
3 3 Like the substantival genitive, according to § 129 h, the possessive pronoun may
also be paraphrased by a relative clause, e. g. Ru 2:21 ??? ? ???? ?????????? the young men,
which are to me, i.e. my young men; so especially, when the substantive, which should
take a genitive suffix, is already followed by a genitive, e. g. 1 S 17:40. In this case,
however, the suffix also is sometimes attached pleonastically, e. g. Ct 1:6 ??? ?? ??????? my
vineyard, which belongs to me. Cf. Ct 3:7, and the analogous pleonasms in 2 S 22:2
(but see Ps 18:2) and Ps 27:2.
1 1 On the other hand, more explicitly in prose, Gn 44:2
the silver cup.

???? ??????? ????????????

 my cup,

(cid:31)???

weapons of war [cf. Is 41:12]; Is 56:7 ????????? ???? my house of prayer, although the
genitive here does not convey the idea of an attribute.

Rem. 1. Through a weakening in the distinction of gender, which is noticeable elsewhere
(cf. § 110 k, 144 a, 145 p, t, u) and which probably passed from the colloquial language2 into
that of literature, masculine suffixes (especially in the plural) are not infrequently used to
refer to feminine substantives; thus a noun-suffix in the singular, Ex 11:6, 25:19, Ju 11:34; 3 in
the plural, Gn 31:9, 32:16, 41:23, Ex 1:21, 2:17, Nu 27:7 (but the feminine suffix twice
immediately after, and so the Samaritan also in verse 7); 36:6 (Samaritan ????????, but also
????????????); Ju 19:24, 21:22, 1 S 6:7, 10b (????????); 9:20, Is 3:16, Ez 23:45 ff. (alternating with ???);
Am 4:1 f. (but afterwards a feminine suffix); Jb 1:14, 39:3 (?????????? in parallelism with ??????????);
42:15, Ct 4:2, 6:6, Ru 1:8 ff. (along with feminine suffixes); Dn 1:5, 8:9. Verbal suffixes in
the singular, Ex 22:25; in the plural, Ju 16:3, Pr 6:21, Jb 1:15. But Gn 26:15, 18, 33:13, Ex
2:17, 1 S 610 a are to be explained according to § 60 h. On
use of the masculine in general as the prior gender, see § 122 g.

??????  as feminine, see § 32 n. On the

2. The suffix of the 3rd person singular feminine (as also the separate pronoun ???? Nu
14:41, Jos 10:13, Ju 14:4) sometimes refers in a general sense to the verbal idea contained in a
preceding sentence (corresponding to our it); thus the verbal suffix, Gn 15:6, Nu 23:19, 1 S
11:2, 1 K 11:12, Is 30:8, Am 8:10; cf. Gn 24:14 (??? thereby), 42:36, 47:26, Ex 10:11 (?????
that), Is 47:7. Elsewhere the suffix of the 3rd singular feminine refers to the plurals of things,
e. g. 2 K 3:3 [but see Kittel; so 13:2, 6, 11; 10:26, but LXX ???????], Jer 36:23, Jb 6:20 (if the
text is correct), 39:15 (read ??????? in v. 14), and to the plurals of names of animals, Is 35:7, Ezr
11:5. Conversely, plural suffixes refer to collective singulars, e.g. in Gn 15:13, Nu 16:3, 1 S
2:8, Zp 2:7 [but read ????? ???]; and to a verbal idea contained in the preceding clause, in Ez
33:18, Jb 22:21 (????? thereby), Ez 18:26, 33:19 (???????? on that account, thereby).1 But the
suffix in ?????? Dt 21:10 refers to the collective idea contained in
to the sailors included in sense under the term ???????. In Jos 2:4 read ???????????; in Is 30:6 (?????),
38:16, Ps 19:5 (?????) the text is most probably corrupt.

; in Jon 1:3 ??????? refers

???????

????

3. In a few examples the force of the noun-suffix or possessive pronoun has become so
weak that the language appears to be almost entirely unconscious of it. Thus in ??????? my Lord,
usually explained as being from the pluralis maiestatis ???????? (§ 124 i) with the suffix of the
1st singular (always with Qame? to distinguish it from ??????? my lords, Gn 19:2; but see note
below), used exclusively of God, not only in addressing him (Gn 15:2, 18:3, Ps 35:23), but

2 2 According to Diehl (see the title at the head of § 91 a), who adduces numerous
instances on pp. 44 ff., 54 ff., 67 f., many of these cases may be set down to
corruption of the traditional text, while the sudden (and sometimes repeated) change
of gender in suffixes is mainly due to the influence exercised on the copyists by the
Mishnic and popular Aramaic dialects, neither of which recognizes such distinctions.
Such influence, however, is insufficient to explain the large number of instances of
this weakening, occurring even in the earlier documents.
3 3 The Masora reckons six instances of
????(cid:31)??
11:34, where, however, the text is most probably corrupt), Ex 25:15 (?), Lv 6:8, 7:18,
27:9, Jos 1:7; almost all these passages can, however, be easily explained in other
ways.
1 1 In 2 K 7:10 for ????? (the LXX had

 would be expected (Ju

) read ????????.

, where

????(cid:31)???

??(cid:31)???

ultimately (see, however, the note below), without any regard to the pronoun, as equivalent to
the Lord.2 On ??????? as a Qerê perpetuum of the Masoretes for ???? see § 17 c and § 102 m.

?????

??????? ????

 1 K 3:18 in reference to two women; Is 41:1, Jb 9:32, Neh 6:2, 7; after

A similar loss of vitality in the suffix is generally assumed in ??????? prop. in his unitedness,
i.e. he &c. together, e.g. ??????? ????????? Ex 19:8; then, without regard to the suffix, even after the
1st person
the 2nd person, Is 45:20, &c. But the supposed pronominal suffix is perhaps rather to be
explained, with Brockelmann, ZA. xiv. 344 f., as an old adverbial ending, which survives in
the Arabic adverbs in u and in Assyrian.—Cf. further ????? prop. their entirety, but also after
the 2nd person equivalent to all together, 1 K 22:28, Mi 1:2 (hear, ye peoples, all of you; cf. §
144 p), and even before the 2nd person, Jb 17:10 (in 1 S 6:4 read ????? with the LXX).—On the
redundant suffix in ??????????? Lv 27:23, cf. § 127 i.

§ 136. The Demonstrative Pronoun.

The demonstrative pronouns are ???, fem. ????, plur.

??????  (§ 34), hic, haec (hoc), hi,

??????

?????? , fem.

&c., and the personal pronoun ???, likewise used as a demonstrative, fem. ????, plur.
masc.
between them in usage is that ??? (like hic, ???) almost always points out a (new)
person or thing present, while ??? (like is, ille, ?????, ???????) refers to a person or
thing already mentioned or known (see the examples below).1

 (§ 32 b), is, ea (id), or ille, &c., ii, eae or illi, &c. The distinction

Rem. 1. Compare the instructive examples in Gn 32:3, Ju 7:4 of whom I say unto thee,

this (???) shall go with thee, he (???) shall go with thee (so afterwards with negatives).
Moreover, ????? ????? this day, i.e. the actual day on which one is speaking or writing (Gn 26:33,
&c.), but ????? ????? the day or period of which the historian has just been speaking (Gn 15:18,
26:32) or of which the prophet has just been foretelling (Is 5:30, 7:18, 20 ff.) and of which he
continues to speak or foretell. Nevertheless ??? and
combinations where ??? and
????
?????, plur.

??????  would be expected, and vice versa; thus almost always  ???????
 or ????? ????????—With a secondary sense of contempt (like
???? ????????

??????  are also found in certain common

???? ??????????

, but

????

2 2 Cf. the same weakening of the force of the possessive pronoun in ????? prop. my
master, from the second century A.D. onwards the master; so also in Syriac ??? my
lord, and ultimately as a title the lord; in Italian Madonna, French Madame, Notre
Dame, Monsieur, Monseigneur, &c. It can, however, hardly be doubted that the
regular distinction between ??????? as a holy name, and ??????? as an ordinary appellative
is merely due to the practice of the later Rabbis. G. H. Dalman, Der Gottesname
Adonaj und seine Geschichte (Berlin, 1889), in an exhaustive discussion, shows that
apart from the book of Daniel and the eight critically doubtful passages, in which ????
is used by God himself, there is nowhere any necessity to regard the suffix as entirely
meaningless, since ???? is always used either in an address to or (like ???????, which also
is never a mere phrase or title) in reverent language about God—as the Lord of the
speaker—like the Assyrian b?li-ia, my lord. Against any original distinction between
??????? and ??????? it may be urged especially that when unconnected with suffixes the
singular ???? is always used of God, and not the pluralis maiestatis presupposed by
???????.

use of determinate demonstratives as adjectives, see § 126 u.

Latin iste) ??? occurs, e.g. in 1 S 10:27, 21:16, 1 K 22:27, Is 6:10, &c. In the sense of the
neuter, this, ???? is more common than ???, as Is 5:25, 43:9, &c., but ??? more common than
????.

2. Both ??? and ??? are sometimes used almost as enclitics to emphasize interrogative
words (like the Latin nam in quisnam; cf. also quis tandem); e.g. Jb 38:2 ??? ??? who now
(darkeneth, &c.) …? 1 S 17:55 f., Is 63:1, Jer 49:19, Ps 24:8, 25:12, &c; ??????? what now? 1 S
10:11; how now? Gn 27:20; why now? Ju 18:24; but before the verb  ?????
 it is usually ????????
???????  wherefore now? Gn 18:13, 25:22, 1 S 17:28, 2 S
Gn 3:13, 12:18, Ex 14:5, Ju 15:11;
12:23, &c.—So also ??????? Is 50:9, Jb 4:7 ff.; and still more emphatically ??????? ??? Ps 24:10,
Jer 30:21.

???

???

????

3. ??? is likewise used as an enclitic (see c above): (a) of place, in such passages as Gn
27:21 ???? ??? ??????? whether thou (that art here) be my son Esau? 2 S 2:20 is it thou? ?????????
behold, here, 1 K 19:5, Is 21:9; 2 cf. also the strengthening of the separate pronoun by ??? Is
??? ???  these are, Gn 25:16, 1 S 4:8; (b)
43:25 (
of time: ??? ????? now, 1 K 17:24; just now, 2 K 5:22; and rather frequently before words
denoting number, e.g. Gn 27:36
 twice, now; cf. 31:38, 2 S 14:2, Jb 1:12, 7:3, 19:3;
separated from the numeral in Gn 31:41 ??????? elliptically for this, i.e. this present period, is to
me, i.e. makes altogether, twenty years, &c. The other examples are similarly elliptical.

§ 137. The Interrogative Pronouns.

The interrogative pronoun ??? who may refer either to a masculine or feminine

person (Ct 3:6), or even to a plural, e.g. ???? ??? who are ye? Jos 9:8;
Nu 22:9 (more minutely, ????? ??? Ex 10:8, i.e. who exactly, who in particular?). It is
used of the neuter only when the idea of a person is implied, e.g. ??? ??????? who are the
Shechemites? Ju 9:28, 13:17, Gn 33:8, Mi 1:5; even more boldly, with the repetition
of a ??? used personally, in 1 S 18:18, 2 S 7:18.—Another interrogative is ??????? which,
what?; of persons only in Est 7:5.

 Gn 33:5,

??????

????

Moreover, ??? may also be used in the sense of a genitive, e.g. ??? ??????? whose
daughter art thou? Gn 24:23, 1 S 17:55, 56, 58; ??? ????? whose word? Jer 44:28, 1 S
12:3; in the accusative, ??????? quemnam? 1 S 28:11, Is 6:8; with prepositions, e.g. ?????
1 K 20:14 (in an abrupt question by whom?); ????? Gn 32:18; ??? ??????? 1 S 24:15.—
Similarly ???, ????, ??? what? is used for the nominative, or accusative, or genitive (Jer
8:9), or with prepositions, e.g. ??????? whereupon? Is 1:5, Jb 38:6; why? Nu 22:32, &c.;
??????? quousque? Ps 74:9.1

2 2 On the other hand, it is very questionable whether ??? in Ps 104:25 (????? ???), Is 23:13 ( ???
?????), Ju 5:5, Ps 68:9 (?????? ???) can be taken, according to the common explanation, simply as a
prefixed demonstrative particle (the sea yonder, &c.). In Ps 104:25 ????? may be in apposition
to ???; cf. § 126 aa, on Ex 32:1, and Zc 5:7, where ???? ?????? is in apposition to ???? depending
on ?????, and also Ez 40:45, where ??? ?????? is in apposition to ???; otherwise it is most naturally
taken as the subject, this is the sea. Is 23:13, Ju 5:5, 1 K 14:14, and Ps 68:9 might also be
explained in the same way; but in these passages the text is almost certainly corrupt. In Ju 5:5
in fact ?????? ??? is most probably to be regarded with Moore as a very early gloss, which
subsequently found its way from this passage into Ps 68.
1 1 A quite different use of ??? was pointed out (privately) by P. Haupt in Ct 5:8 will ye
not tell him? i.e. I charge you that ye tell him, and 7:1 = look now at the Shulamite,

Rem. Both ??? and ??? are used also in indirect questions (on the merely relative distinction

????????

 with Samar. and LXX), 43:22, Ex 32:1.—On the meaning of ??? and ???

between direct and indirect questions in Hebrew, see the Interrogative Sentences), e.g. Gn
39:8 (but read
as interrogatives is based also their use as indefinite pronouns (equivalent to quisquis,
quodcunque or quicquam), e.g. Ex 32:26, Ju 7:3, 1 S 20:4, Is 50:10 (read ??? ???? in the
apodosis), 54:15, Pr 9:4, 16, 2 Ch 36:23; even ???????? ?? have a care, whosoever ye be, 2 S
18:12 (unless ??? is to be read, with the LXX, for ???); so also ??? (whatever it be) Jb 13:13, 1 S
19:3, 2 S 18:22, 23; cf. Nu 23:3
 and whatsoever he showeth me. Cf. also ? ???? ???

§ 138. The Relative Pronoun.

Cf. Philippi, Stat. constr. (see heading of § 89), p. 71 f., and especially V. Baumann,
Hebräische Relativsätze, Leipzig, 1894.

Relative clauses are most frequently (but not necessarily; cf. § 155 b) introduced

by the indeclinable ? ???? (see § 36).1 This is not, however, a relative pronoun in the
Greek, Latin, or English sense, nor is it a mere nota relationis,2 but an original
demonstrative pronoun [as though iste, istius, &c.].3 Hence it is used—

(1) In immediate dependence on the substantival idea to be defined, and virtually
in the same case as it (hence belonging syntactically to the main clause); e.g. Gn 24:7
 the Lord, iste, he took me … he shall send, &c. (= who
…
took me); Gn 2:2 and God finished ? ???? ? ???? ????????? his work, istud, he had made (it).
Such qualifying clauses may be called dependent relative clauses.

?????? ? ???? ???????

??? ???? ???

 ???
?

 ...

corresponding to the late Arabic mâ tarâ, just see! mâ taqûlu, say now! It has long
been recognized that ??? is used as a negative in Ct 8:4.
1 1 The etymology of the word is still a matter of dispute. Against the identification of
? ????, as an original substantive, with the Arabic ?at(cid:31)ar, trace, Aram. ????? place, trace,
Nöldeke urges (ZDMG. xl. 738) that the expression trace of … could hardly have
developed into the relative conjunction, while the meaning of place has been evolved
only in Aramaic, where the word is never used as a relative. According to others, ? ????
is really a compound of several pronominal roots; cf. Sperling, Die Nota relationis im
Hebraäischen, Leipzig, 1876, and König, Lehrgeb., ii. 323 ff., who follows Ewald
and Böttcher in referring it to an original ? ????. According to Hommel (ZDMG. xxxii.
708 ff.) ? ???? is an original substantive, to be distinguished from  ??·
 (an original
pronominal stem), but used in Hebrew as a nota relationis, or (as ??? and ?? are also
sometimes used, see below, g and h) simply for the relative pronoun. Baumann (op.
cit., p. 44) sees in the Assyrian ša, Phoenician, Punic, and Hebrew  ??, the ground-
forms, of which the Phoenician and Punic ?? (see above, § 36 note) and the Hebrew
? ???? are developments.
2 2 E.g. like Luther’s use of so, in die fremden Götter, so unter euch sind, Gn 35:2.
3 3 This is the necessary conclusion both from the analogy of the Arabic ’allad-i,
which is clearly a demonstrative (like the Hebr. ?????, ???????), and from the use of ??? and
?? as relatives.

 and  ??·

Rem. 1. In the above examples ? ???? in Gn 24:7 is virtually in the nominative, in Gn 2:2 in

????

??????

, while in Gn 2:2 it is not resumed at all. This suppression of the

the accusative. A further distinction between the examples is that in Gn 24:7 the main idea
(????), to which ? ???? is added in apposition, is only resumed in the qualifying clause by the
subject (he) inherent in
retrospective pronoun1 takes place especially when it (as in Gn 2:2) would represent an
accusative of the object, or when it would be a separate pronoun representing a nominative of
the subject in a noun-clause, e.g. Gn 1:7
firmament, &c. In negative sentences, however, the retrospective pronoun is not infrequently
added, e.g. Gn 17:12 ???; 7:2 ????; 1 K 9:20
; but cf. also ??? ??? ? ???? Gn 9:3.
??????
The addition of ???? in a verbal clause, 2 K 22:13, is unusual.

 the waters, those, under the

?????????? ??????? ? ???? ???

?????? ; Dt 20:15

?????

The very frequent omission of the retrospective pronoun is noticeable in cases where the
predicate of the qualifying clause is a verbum dicendi, e.g. Nu 10:29 we are journeying unto
the place, ????? ????? ???? ??????? ???? ? ???? that place, the Lord said (of it), It will I give to you; cf.
Nu 14:40, Ju 8:15, 1 S 9:17, 23, 24:5, 1 K 8:29, Jer 32:43.

2. When the substantive, followed by ? ???? and the qualifying clause, expresses an idea of
??????  thither, ?????? thence, e.g.

place, it may also be resumed by the adverbs of place ? ?? there,
Gn 13:3 ??????????? ??????? ? ?? ??????? ???? unto the place, that one, his tent had been there, i.e.
where his tent had been; cf. Gn 3:23 ??????, Ex 21:13
retrospective word may be omitted, cf. Gn 35:14, Nu 20:13, Is 64:10, where ? ?? would be
expected, and Gn 30:38, Nu 13:27, 1 K 12:2, where
??????  would be expected.—When the
appositional clause is added to a word of time, the retrospective pronoun is always omitted,
e.g. 1 S 20:31 for all the days, ??? ? ???????? ? ???? those—the son of Jesse is living (in them); cf. Gn
45:6, Dt 1:46, 9:7, 1 K 11:42; see Baumann, op. cit., p. 33.

?????? . But even in this case the

3. If the governing substantive forms part of a statement made in the first or second
person, the retrospective pronoun (or the subject of the appositional clause) is in the same
person, e.g. Gn 45:4 I am Joseph, ????? ??????????? ???? he—ye sold me, i.e. whom ye sold; Nu
22:30, Is 49:23; 41:8 thou, Jacob,
Gn 15:7 I am the Lord,

???????? ? ????
 he—I brought thee out, &c., Ex 20:2 (Dt 5:6).

????
???????? ? ????

 he—I have chosen thee; Jer 33:19, Ec 10:16 f.;

????

(2) Not depending (adjectivally) on a governing substantive, but itself expressing
a substantival idea. Clauses introduced in this way may be called independent relative
clauses. This use of ? ???? is generally rendered in English by he who, he whom, &c.
(according to the context), or that which, &c., or sometimes of such a kind as (qualis),
cf. Ex 14:13 b, and in a dependent relative clause Is 7:17. In reality, however, the ? ????
is still a demonstrative belonging to the construction of the main clause as subject or
object, or as a genitive dependent on a noun or preposition, e.g. Nu 22:6 ???? ????? ? ????
iste—thou cursest (him)—is cursed, i.e. he whom thou cursest, &c.; Ex 22:8; 2 ? ???? as
object, Gn 44:1, 491, 1 S 16:3 ff., Mi 6:1 (? ???? ???); and even preceding the verb, e.g.
Is 52:15, Ps 69:5; ? ???? as genitive, Ez 23:28 I will deliver thee ? ???? ????? ???? ?? into the
hand of those—thou hatest (them); depending on a preposition, e.g. ? ??????? Gn 44:4, 2

1 1 The instances in which, instead of a retrospective pronoun, the main idea itself is
repeated (Gn 49:30, 50:13, Jer 31:32) are most probably all due to subsequent
amplification of the original text by another hand.
2 2 The absolute use of ? ???? is very peculiar in the formula ???? ??? ????? ????? ? ???? this (is
it)—it came as the word of the Lord to …, Jer 14:1, 46:1, 47:1, 49:34.

K 10:22; ? ??????? Gn 21:17, ? ?? ??? ? ??????? in that (place)—he is there, i.e. where he is;
cf. Jul 17:8 and Ru 1:16 ? ???????? whither; 1 1 K 18:12 ? ???????? whither; ? ??????? Ex 5:11.

 ...

 ???? ???????

From these examples it follows that in independent relative clauses the retrospective
suffix, or adverb of place, may be, and in fact generally is, omitted. As a rule, however (as in
the dependent relative clause), this does not apply to eases in which the retrospective
pronoun, by the construction of the sentence, depends on a preposition,2 e.g. Gn 44:9 f.  ? ????
?????
 he—it (the cup) is found with him,—shall die (for the W?w of the apodosis in
????? cf. § 143 d). In such cases ? ???? preceded by the preposition is quite anomalous, as in Gn
31:32 ??????? ? ???? ??? with whomsoever thou findest, where ? ???? is a relative pronoun in the
English sense; on the other hand, in Is 47:12 (and probably also 56:4) ? ??????? is to be explained
(with Baumann, op. cit., p. 37) by reference to 47:15, as a demonstrative pronoun, stand now
with thine enchantments …, with those—thou hast laboured (with them).

[With regard to the preceding explanation of ? ????, the student will of course understand
that, in Hebrew as we know it, ? ???? never occurs as a mere demonstrative. A particle which,
whatever its origin, is uniformly used with reference to something in another, contiguous
clause, will naturally have acquired in practice that force which we denote by the term
‘relative’.]

Like the original demonstrative pronoun ? ????, the demonstratives proper ???, ??, ??

(the last commonly),3 and sometimes the article, are used somewhat frequently in
poetic language to introduce both dependent and independent relative clauses. With
regard to the construction of ???, &c., the remarks on ? ????, under a and e, also hold
good.

Examples:—

?????

(a) ??? in apposition to a governing substantive in the nominative, Ps 104:26

 hearken unto thy father, him—he begat thee, i.e. who begat thee; Ps 17:9 (??).—In Ps

???????? ?????????
(there is) leviathan, he—thou hast formed (him), i.e. whom thou hast formed; Is 42:24 (??); in
the accusative, Is 25:9, Ps 74:2 (in both eases with a retrospective pronoun; ?? is used without
it in Ps 132:12); in apposition to a genitive dependent on a preposition, Pr 23:22
????? ??? ??
?
??????
???
104:8
in the genitive after the construct state ????? to the place of that, thou hadst founded (it) for
them; on the same analogy we may also take, with Baumann (op. cit., p. 48), Ps 78:54, (??? ???)
and Ex 15:13 (
), 15:16, Is 43:21, Ps 9:16, 10:2, 31:5, 32:8, 62:12, 142:4, 143:8 (all
?????
examples of ??).

 unto the place which thou hadst founded for them (cf. § 130 c), ??? is

?? ?????????

??? ??????

????? ????

 ??? ???

???? ?
?

To introduce independent relative clauses ??? is used as a nominative in Jb 19:19; as
accusative, Jb 15:17 and ?? Hb 1:11, Ps 68:29 (after a preposition, ??? Ex 13:8; but the text is
evidently corrupt).

(b) More certain examples of the use of the article as a relative pronoun (more correctly,
perhaps, of the demonstrative which is otherwise used as article) are 1 Ch 26:28  ??????????? ???
????? ?? all that Samuel had dedicated, &c.; 1 Ch 29:8 (where ??????? can only be perfect Niph?al);

1 1 In Zc 12:10 also, instead of the unintelligible ??? ?? ???, we should probably read
? ????????, and refer the passage to this class.
2 2 Such a strong ellipse as in Is 31:6, where
????(cid:31)??
possible in elevated poetic or prophetic language.
3 3 The etymological equivalent ???, ?? in Aramaic is always a relative.

 would be expected after ??????, is only

2 Ch 29:36, Ezr 10:14. In connexion with a plural, Jos 10:24 the chiefs of the men of war
???? ????????? who went with him; Ezr 8:25, 10:17, 1 Ch 29:17. Finally, in the sense of id quod,
Jer 5:13 (where, however, we should read with the LXX ???????). Cf. moreover, 1 S 9:24 the
thigh
?????? ? ??????? to the place, that he had prepared.

 and that which was upon it (but see k below); 2 Ch 1:4 ????????? equivalent to

In all the examples adduced except 1 S 9:24 (where ??????????? should probably be read for

 the ?? is followed by undoubted perfects; almost all the examples, moreover, belong to
????
the latest Books (Ezra and Chronicles). On the other hand, another series of instances (even in
the older texts) is extremely doubtful, in which the Masora likewise requires perfects, either

§ 139. Expression of Pronominal Ideas by means of Substantives.

Analogous to the periphrases for expressing materials and attributes by means of

substantives (§ 128 o and p), is the use of substantives to represent certain kinds of
pronominal ideas, for which no special expressions exist. Thus—

1. ????, ?????? man, woman, are used to express—

(a) The idea of each, every (in the sense of each severally) with reference to persons,1 and

even animals (Gn 15:10), e.g. Gn 10:5, feminine Ex 3:22; ???? is the object, e.g. in Jer 12:15.
On ????—???? cf. § 123 c.

In a few passages ???? in the above sense is placed for the sake of emphasis before the
governing noun (always a substantive with a suffix), thus ????? ???? ????? Gn 9:5, according to the
usual explanation, stands for ???? ????? ????? at the hand of the brother of every man. But although
the explanation seems to be supported by Gn 42:25 and Nu 17:17, it is inconceivable that
such an inversion of nomen regens and rectum should occur. It is more likely, either that the
second substantive is in apposition to ???? (thus Gn 9:5 at the hand of every man, his brother,
[unless it is a combination of the two readings ???? ????? and ??????? ?????]; similarly 15:10 and he
laid each or, more exactly, one piece of it, &c., and so probably also Nu 17:17 every one, sc.
his name), or ???? precedes as a kind of casus pendens, and only receives its nearer definition
from the following substantive with suffix; thus Gn 41:12, 42:25 (according to the context =
to every one in his sack); 42:35, where
???? ????????????
12:4, 28:21, Nu 5:10, 26:54, 2 K 23:35, and especially Zc 7:10.1

 is virtually the predicate of ????; Ex

??

1 1 As a rule ???? is used in the particularizing sense of each man, with the plural of
the verb, e.g. Gn 44:11; sometimes, however, as subject to a verb in the singular, e.g.
Gn 44:13.
1 1 Cf. on the whole question the thorough discussion by Budde, Die bibl.
Urgeschichte, p. 283 ff.: according to him, the words in Gn 9:5 are to be rendered at
the hand of one another (from men mutually) will I require it. [In support of this
view, Budde points to Zc 7:10 ?? ????????? ????? ???? ??????? ???????????, which in the light of
8:17, ??????????? ?? ????????? ?????? ????????? ??????, can only, he observes, be rendered ‘and
devise not the hurt of one another in your heart’. So also König, Syntax, § 33.]

(b) Any one, some one, e.g. Gn 13:16, Ct 8:7, with a negative no one; 2 so after ??? Ex
16:19, 29; before ??? Gn 23:6 and frequently.—Instead of ???? we sometimes find in a similar
sense ???? man, homo, e.g. Lv 1:2 (cf. ??????? ?????? as any one else, Ju 16:7, 11),
person, Lv 2:1, 5:1, &c., and in a neuter sense ????? (prop. word, thing) for anything, Gn 18:14,
or  ????????
??? Ec 8:5.—Cf. finally, ??????? any one, Dt 15:7; anything, Ez 18:10 (but in Lv 4:2, 5:13
???????) and the expressions noticed in § 144 e. The latter include also instances like Ez 18:32 I
have no pleasure ????? ?????? in the death of him that dieth, i.e. of any man.

 Lv 5:2, Nu 31:23. With a negative ????? means nothing; thus after ??? Gn 19:8; after

??????  (soul)

?

(c) In connexion with ????? his brother or

 his neighbour, ???? one, masc. (as ?????? one,
???????
fem., in connexion with ??????? her sister or ??????? her neighbour) is used to represent the ideas
of alter—alter, the one—the other3 (in reference to persons, animals, or things without life;
see the Lexicon) or the idea of one another, e.g. Gn 13:11 and they separated them selves  ????
?????
??????????? ?????? one to another.

 the one from the other; Ex 26:3 five curtains (???????? fem.) shall be coupled together

 ?????

2.

??????  soul, person expresses the idea of self, 4 both in the singular, Pr 19:8, 16, 29:24, Jb
??  equivalent to himself) and in the plural, Jer 37:9, &c. Similar to this is

18:4 (in all cases
the use of ?????????? Gn 18:12 (prop. in her inward part) in the sense of within herself.5

????

3.

??????  bone (then metaphorically for substance) expresses the idea of self, selfsame, very

same, in reference to things (as
7:13, cf. Jos 10:27, Ez 24:2;
24:10;
?????
21:23.

???? ???

??????  to persons, e.g.
??????? ???

?????

??????? ???
?

????? ????? ???

?????

 in the selfsame day, Gn

 as it were the very heaven for clearness, Ex

 in the very fullness of his strength (= in the midst of his full strength), Jb

4. The simple plural of words denoting time sometimes includes also the idea of a few,
some; 1 thus ?????? a few days, Gn 24:55, 40:4 (here even of a longer period, = for some time);
Is 65:20, Dn 8:27 (on the other hand, Gn 27:44, 29:20 ???????? ??????; see § 96 under ?????); ???? ??
some years, Dn 11:6, 8.

and k.
5 5 In a similar way the idea of self in Arabic, as in Sanskrit (âtman), is paraphrased
by soul, spirit; in Arabic also by eye; in Rabbinic by ??? body,
 bone, in
Ethiopic and Amharic by head, in Egyptian by mouth, hand, &c.; cf. also the Middle
High German mîn lîp, dîn lîp, for ich, du. However,
 in such cases is never (not
even in Is 46:2 ? ?????? they themselves) a merely otiose periphrasis for the personal
pronoun, but always involves a reference to the mental personality, as affected by the
senses, desires, &c.
1 1 Some in reference to persons in Ex 16:20 is expressed by ?? ??????, and in Neh 5:2–4
by ? ???? ??? sunt qui, with a participle following.

THE SENTENCE

The Sentence in General.

§ 140. Noun-clauses, Verbal-clauses, and the Compound Sentence.

1. Every sentence, the subject and predicate of which are nouns or their

equivalents (esp. participles), is called a noun-clause, e.g. ???????? ??????? the Lord is our
king, Is 33:22; ?????????? ?????? ????? ? ??????? now the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners,
Gn 13:13; ????? ??? a mouth is theirs, Ps 115:5; see further, § 141.

2. Every sentence, the subject of which is a noun (or pronoun included in a verbal-

form) and its predicate a finite verb, is called a verbal-clause, e.g.
God said, Gn 1:3; ????????? and he divided, 1:7; see further, § 142.

???????? ???

?????

 and

?

Rem. In the last example the pronominal subject is at least indicated by the preformative
(?), and in almost all forms of the perfect by afformatives. The 3rd pers. sing. perf. however,
which contains no indication of the subject, must also be regarded as a full verbal-clause.

3. Every sentence, the subject or predicate of which is itself a full clause, is called
a compound sentence, e.g. Ps 18:31 ?????? ?????? ????? God—his way is perfect, equivalent
to God’s way is perfect; Gn 34:8 ????????? ?????? ??? ????? ????? ??? ?? my son Shechem—his soul
longeth for your daughter; see further, § 143.

4. The above distinction between different kinds of sentences—especially between

noun- and verbal-clauses—is indispensable to the more delicate appreciation of
Hebrew syntax (and that of the Semitic languages generally), since it is by no means
merely external or formal, but involves fundamental differences of meaning. Noun-
clauses with a substantive as predicate, represent something fixed, a state or in short,
a being so and so; verbal-clauses on the other hand, something moveable and in
progress, an event or action. The latter description is indeed true in a certain sense
also of noun-clauses with a participial predicate, except that in their case the event or
action (as distinguished from that expressed by the verbal-clause) is of a fixed and
abiding character.

Rem. By the Arab grammarians every clause beginning with an independent subject is
regarded as a noun-clause, and every clause beginning with a finite verb as verbal. If a finite
verb follows the noun-subject the two together (since the verb comprises its own subject and
is thus a complete verbal-clause) form a compound noun-sentence, just as when the predicate
consists of an independent noun-clause. Though this definition of the different kinds of
sentence, which we formerly accepted (in § 144 a of the 22nd to the 24th German editions of
this Grammar), is rejected above, a–d, we must, nevertheless, mention here the point in which
this more complicated view of the Arab grammarians may be regarded as at least relatively
correct, namely, in classifying verbal-clauses according as the subject precedes or follows the
verb, a distinction which is often of great importance in Hebrew also; see further, in § 142 a.

§ 141. The Noun-clause.

1. The subject of a noun-clause (see § 140 a) may be—

(a) A substantive, e.g.

????

???? ????? ???????

 and a river went out (was going out) of Eden,

Gn 2:10.

(b) A pronoun, e.g. Gn 7:4 ???????? ??????? I will cause it to rain; 14:18 ????? ????? and he
??????  before a plural in Ex 32:4);
 and of him one became a

was priest; 2:23 (???? before a feminine predicate, as
????? ??? who is wise? Ho 14:10.—In 1 Ch 5:2
???? ?????????
prince, the subject is contained in

.1

???

???????

2. The predicate of a noun-clause may be—

(a) A substantive, e.g. Dt 14:1 ???? ???? ?????? ye are children of the Lord your God;
Gn 42:13. Specially characteristic of the Semitic mode of expression are the cases in
which both subject and predicate are substantives, thus emphasizing their identity
(‘the thing is its measure, material, or equivalent’), e.g. Ez 41:22
??? the altar (was) wood …, and the walls thereof (were) wood, i.e. of wood. Cf.
below, c.

 ????????????

 ??? ??????????

 ...

(b) An adjective or participle, e.g. Gn 2:12

 and the gold of that
land is good; ? ??? ????????? now Ephron was sitting, &c., Gn 23:10.2 Very frequently such
noun-clauses, attached by W?w to a verbal-clause, are used to represent a state
contemporaneous with the principal action; cf. e below.

??? ?????? ???

??? ???????

?

(c) A numeral, e.g. Gn 42:13

????

?????? ? ???? ???? ??

 the twelve (of us) are thy servants.

(d) A pronoun, e.g. Gn 10:12 (????), Ex 9:27 (?????), Gn 24:65 (???), 1 K 9:13 (???).1

(e) An adverb or (esp. if formed with a preposition) any specification of time,
place, quality, possessor, &c., which may be regarded as the equivalent of a noun-
idea, e.g.
?????? his mercy endureth for ever, Ps 136:1 f.;
112:3;

??????? ? ??  riches are in his house, Ps

 we are his, Ps 100:3 Qerê.

 there is the bdellium, Gn 2:12;

????
?? ???
??

 where is Abel? 4:9;  ???????

?????? ? ??

?????? ??

????

???

Rem. 1. The employment of a substantive as predicate of a noun-clause is especially
frequent, either when no corresponding adjective exists (so mostly with words expressing the
material; cf. § 128 o) or when the attribute is intended to receive a certain emphasis. For in all
cases there is a much greater stress upon a substantival predicate,2 since it represents

1 1 For other remarkable instances of ellipse in the Chronicler, see Driver,
Introduction, ed. 8, p. 537, no. 27.
2 2 Cf. the numerous examples in § 116 n–p.
1 1 Why in these examples the pronouns, notwithstanding appearances to the contrary,
are to be considered as predicates and not as subjects, may be seen from what has
been remarked above, § 126 k.
2 2 The same naturally applies to most of those cases which are not pure noun-clauses,
but have the substantival predicate connected with the subject by ????? (e.g. Gn 1:2 and
the earth was a waste and emptiness; cf. Ps 35:6, Pr 8:30, Jb 3:4) or where a
preposition precedes the substantival predicate, as Ps 29:4 the voice of the Lord is
with power, i.e. powerful.

something as identical with the subject (see above, b [a]), than upon an adjectival or verbal
predicate; cf. Ct 1:10; Ps 25:10 all the paths of the Lord are
???????? ???  lovingkindness and
truth (i.e. wholly lovingkindness, &c.; cf. Jer 10:10); Ez 38:5, Ps 10:5, 19:10, 23:5, 88:19, Pr
3:17, 3 Jb 22:12, 23:2, 26:13, Ru 3:2. Sometimes the emphasis on the predicate is obtained by
the use of the plural form (according to § 124 e), e.g. Ps 110:3 thy people are ??????? altogether
willingness; Ct 5:16, Dn 9:23.

Sometimes the boldness of such combinations is modified by the repetition of the subject,
as regens of the predicate, e.g. Jb 6:12 ????? ???????? ???????? is my strength the strength of stones?
Pr 3:17. That the language, however—especially in poetry—is not averse even to the boldest
combinations in order to emphasize very strongly the unconditional relation between the
subject and predicate, is shown by such examples as Ps 45:9 myrrh and aloes and cassia are
all thy garments (i.e. so perfumed with them that they seem to be composed of them); Ct 1:15
thine eyes are doves, i.e. dove’s eyes (but 5:12 ????????);4 Ps 23:5, 109:4, Jb 8:9, 12:12, Ct 2:13.
In prose, e.g. Ex 9:31, Ezr 10:13 ???? ???? ????? the season is rain showers, i.e. the rainy season;
with a bold enallage of the number, Gn 34:30 ??????? ????? ???????? and I (with my family) am
persons few in number. For similarly bold expressions with ????? cf. Gn 11:1, 12:2, Ex 17:12, Is
5:12, Jer 2:28, and again with a bold enallage of the number, Jb 29:15 I was eyes to the blind,
and feet was I to the lame, but in prose, Nu 10:31 and thou shalt be to us

.

??????????

2. The noun-clause connected by w?w copulative to a verbal-clause, or its equivalent,
always describes a state contemporaneous with the principal action, or (when the predicate is
a transitive participle) an action represented in constant duration (cf. § 107 d, as well as § 116
n and o), e.g. Gn 19:1 and the two angels came to Sodom at even, ? ??? ????? while Lot sat, &c.;
18:1, 8, 16, 22, 25:26, Ju 13:9, 1 S 1:9, 2 S 4:7, 11:4 (always with a participle); with an
adjectival predicate, Gn 18:12; with a substantival predicate, 18:27; with an adverbial
predicate, 9:23. Not infrequently such a circumstantial clause indicates at the same time some
contradictory fact, so that ?? is equivalent to whereas, whilst, although, e.g. Gn 15:2, 18:27,
20:3, 48:14 (although he was the younger); Ju 16:15 how canst thou say, I love thee,  ???? ????????
?????
 whereas thine heart is not with me? 2 S 3:39, Ps 28:3 whilst mischief is in their hearts.
These clauses describing a state are, however, only a subdivision of the large class of
circumstantial clauses, on which see § 156.

3. As the examples given under a and b show, the syntactical relation existing
between the subject and predicate of a noun-clause is as a rule expressed by simple
juxtaposition, without a copula of any kind. To what period of time the statement
applies must be inferred from the context; e.g. 1 K 18:21 ??????????? ??????? the Lord is the
true God; 1 S 9:19; Is 31:2 ????? ??????? yet he also is wise; Gn 42:11; on the other hand,
Gn 19:1 ? ??? ????? and (=while) Lot was sitting; Ez 28:15; Gn 7:4 ???????? ??????? I am
raining, i.e. I will rain. Sometimes even a jussive or optative is to be supplied as
predicate, Gn 27:13 upon me be thy curse; Gn 11:3, 20:13, Ex 12:2. Cf. § 116 r, note.

3 3 ??? ?? here, as in Jb 21:9, is evidently a substantive after a plural subject; on the
other hand, it is doubtful whether ??? ?? in such passages as Gn 43:27, 2 S 20:9, Ps
120:7, &c., is not rather to be regarded as an adjective.
4 4 As a rule, in such comparisons ??   (which is then to be regarded as nominative)
stands before the predicate, e.g. Is 63:2 wherefore are thy garments ????? ???????? like
those of one that treadeth in the wine-press? (prop. the like of one that treadeth, instar
calcantis); Jer 50:9. The comparison is then much less emphatic than in the noun-
clauses cited above.

Not infrequently, however, a connexion is established between subject and
predicate (a) by adding the separate pronoun of the 3rd person singular or plural,
expressly resuming and therefore strengthening the subject, or (b) (especially for the
sake of a more exact specification of time) by the help of the verb ?????. The first of
these will be a compound sentence, since the predicate to the main subject consists of
an independent clause.

Examples of (a): Gn 41:26 the seven good kine

????

?? ???? ?? ???

???

1:17, 4:24; Ec 5:18 ???? ???????? ????? ??? this—it is a gift of God; Nu 3:27
??? ??? ; in a question,
Gn 27:38. Sometimes ??? is used in this way to strengthen a pronominal subject of the first or
second person, and at the same time to connect it with the predicate which follows,1 e.g.  ???????
??? ??????? Is 43:25 I, even I, am he that blotteth out, &c.; 51:12; ??? ???? 2 S 7:28, Is 37:16, Ps
44:5, Neh 9:6, 7; in an interrogative sentence, Jer 14:22; 2 in Jer 49:12 ??? in a verbal-clause
strengthens ????.

 they are seven years; Dt
???

Of (b): naturally this does not apply to the examples, in which ?????, in the sense of to

become, to fare, to exist, still retains its full force as a verb, and where accordingly the
sentence is verbal, and not a noun-clause; especially when the predicate precedes the subject.
On the other hand, such examples as Gn 1:2 and the earth was (????????) waste and emptiness,
can scarcely be regarded as properly verbal clauses; ???????? is used here really only for the
purpose of referring to past time a statement which, as the description of a state, might also
appear in the form of a pure noun-clause; cf. Gn 3:1. This is especially true of the somewhat
numerous instances in which ????? occurs as a connecting word between the subject and the
participial predicate; e.g. Ju 1:7, Jb 1:14 (immediately afterwards a pure noun-clause). The
imperfect of ????? announces what is future in Nu 14:33, &c.; cf. § 116 r. However, especially
in the latter case, ????? is not wholly without verbal force, but comes very near to being a mere
copula, and this use is more frequent in the later books1 than in the earlier.

Rem. On the employment of ??? existence, and  ?????

 non-existence, which were originally

substantives (on their tendency to be used as verbs, equivalent to est, and non est, cf. § 100 o,
and the Negative Sentences, § 152) as a connecting link between a pronominal subject and a
participial predicate (especially in conditional and interrogative sentences, Gn 24:42, 49, 43:4,
&c.), see above, § 116 q, and the various kinds of subordinate clauses mentioned in §§ 150,
159.

4. The natural arrangement of words in the noun-clause, as describing a state, is
subject—predicate; the principal stress falls on the former since it is the object of the
description. Very frequently, however (and not merely in poetry, where greater
freedom is naturally allowed in the arrangement of words), the reverse order is found,
i.e. predicate—subject. The latter order must be used when special emphasis is laid on
the predicate,2 or when it consists of an interrogative word; thus with a substantival

1 1 On a similar use of the separate pronoun of the third person in Aramaic (Dn 2:38,
Ezr 5:11, &c.) see Kautzsch, Gramm. des Bibl. Aram., § 87. 3.
2 2 This is of course to be distinguished from the use of ??? (to be inferred from the
context) as predicate in the sense of ? ?????; see above, § 135 a, note 1; or such cases
as Dt 32:39 see now ??? ????? ??? that I, even I, am he; 1 Ch 21:17.
1 1 According to Albrecht, ZAW. viii. 252, especially in Deuteronomy and in the
Priestly Code.
2 2 For the same reason specifications of place (e.g. Gn 4:7) or other adverbial
qualifications may stand at the beginning of the sentence.

predicate, e.g. Gn 3:19 ???? ????? dust thou art; 4:9, 12:13 (my sister, not my wife);
20:2, 12, 29:14, Is 63 b, Jb 5:24, 6:12; with an adjectival predicate, e.g. Is 63 a, 28:21,
Jer 10:6; with a participle, Gn 30:1, 32:12; with an interrogative pronoun, e.g. Gn
24:65; 3 with an adverbial interrogative, e.g. Gn 4:9.

Rem. On the above cf. the exhaustive investigations of C. Albrecht, ‘Die Wortstellung im
hebr. Nominalsatze, ’ ZAW. vii. 218 ff. and viii. 249 ff.; with a complete list of the exceptions
to the order subject—predicate, p. 254 ff. The predicate must precede for the reasons stated
(an adjectival predicate is particularly emphatic when it has the force of a comparative, e.g.
Gn 4:13; the predicate expressed by means of a preposition precedes most frequently when it
serves to convey the ideas of having, possessing, e.g. Gn 18:14, 29:16, &c.; cf. also 26:20,
31:16, 43).

The predicate may precede: (a) when the subject is a pronoun, for ‘the person assumed to

be generally known, does not excite the same interest as that which is stated about him;’ (b)
‘in order not to be a mere appendage to a subject which consists of several words,’ e.g. 2 K
20:19; (c) in interrogative sentences (with a substantival or adjectival predicate or one
compounded with a preposition), e.g. 1 S 16:4; finally (d) in a relative clause, when the
predicate is adverbial or compounded with a preposition, as a rule closely united (by
Maqqeph) with ? ????, e.g. Gn 2:11 ? ???? ????; 1:29 f. ???? ????.

§ 142. The Verbal-clause.

1. By § 140 f there is an essential distinction between verbal-clauses, according as

the subject stands before or after the verb. In the verbal-clause proper the principal
emphasis rests upon the action which proceeds from (or is experienced by) the
subject, and accordingly the verb naturally precedes (necessarily so when it is in the
perf. consec. or imperf. consec.). Nevertheless, the subject does sometimes precede
even in the verbal-clause proper, in the continuation of the narrative, e.g. Gn 7:19, 1 S
18:1, 2 S 19:12; especially so if there is special emphasis upon it, e.g. Gn 3:13 (it is
not I who am to blame, but) the serpent beguiled me, cf. Gn 2:5, &c.1 In the great
majority of instances, however, the position of the subject at the beginning of a
verbal-clause is to be explained from the fact that the clause is not intended to
introduce a new fact carrying on the narrative, but rather to describe a state. Verbal-
clauses of this kind approximate closely in character to noun-clauses, and not
infrequently (viz. when the verbal form might just as well be read as a participle) it is
doubtful whether the writer did not in fact intend a noun-clause.

The particular state represented in the verb may consist—

(a) Of an act completed long before, to which reference is made only because it is

necessary for understanding the sequel of the principal action. If the predicate be a perfect (as
it almost always is in these cases), it is generally to be rendered in English by a pluperfect; cf.
the examples discussed above in § 106 f (1 S 28:3, &c.); also Gn 6:8 (not Noah found grace);
16:1, 18:17, 20:4, 24:1, 39:1 (and Joseph in the meanwhile had been brought down to Egypt);
41:10, Ju 1:16, 1 S 9:15, 14:27, 25:21, 1 K 1:1, &c.—In a wider sense this applies also to

3 3 The only exceptions, according to Albrecht (see the Rem. above), are Ex 16:7, 8.
ZAW. ZAW, = Zeitschrift für die alttestamentliche Wissenschaft, ed. by B. Stade,
Giessen, 1881 ff., and since 1907 by K. Marti.
1 1 This of course applies also to the cases, in which the subject consists of a strongly
emphasized personal pronoun, e.g. Gn 32:13 ???? thou thyself; 33:3 ??? he himself.

such verbal-clauses as Gn 2:6 (see further, § 112 e), since when they serve to represent an
action continuing for a long period in the past, and thus to some extent a state.

(b) Of a fact, contemporaneous with the principal events or continuing as the result of
them. To the former class belong all those instances in which the predicate is combined with
????? (provided that ????? has not, as in Gn 1:2, 3:1, &c., been weakened to a mere copula, in
which case the precedence of the subject is fully explained from the character of the clause as
a noun-clause; cf. § 141 i, and the examples of ?????, &c., with a participle, § 116 r); as an
example of the second class, cf. e.g. Gn 13:12
continued to dwell in the land of Canaan, but Lot dwelt, &c.

???? ???
????????????? ? ???? ??????
?

 Abraham accordingly

Rem. 1. The close relation between verbal-clauses beginning with the subject and actual

noun-clauses, is seen finally from the fact that the former also are somewhat frequently added
with ?? (or subordinated) to a preceding sentence in order to lay stress upon some
accompanying circumstance; on such noun-clauses describing a state or circumstance, cf. §
141 e. This is especially the case, again, when the circumstantial appendage involves an
antithesis; cf. Gn 18:18 seeing that nevertheless Abraham shall surely become, &c.; 24:56,
26:27, Is 29:13, Jer 14:15, Ps 50:17, Jb 21:22, and such examples as Gn 4:2, 4, 29:17, where
by means of ?? a new subject is introduced in express antithesis to one just mentioned.
Moreover, in the examples treated above, under b and c (1 S 28:3, &c.), the subject is
frequently introduced by ??, which then corresponds to the Greek ??, used to interpose an
explanation, &c., see Winer, Gramm. des neutest. Sprachidioms, § 53. 7b.

2. By a peculiar construction verbal-clauses may be joined by means of ?? and a following

subject to participial clauses, e.g. Gn 38:25 ?????? ?? ?????? ?????? ???? she was already brought
forth, when she sent, &c.; 44:3, 4, Ju 18:3, 19:11, 2 S 20:8; for other examples, see § 116 u
(where it is pointed out, note 1, that the apodosis also frequently appears in the form of a
noun-clause, a further proof of the close relation between verbal-clauses beginning with the
subject and noun-clauses proper). Without doubt there is in all these cases a kind of inversion
of the principal clause and the temporal subordinate clause; the latter for the sake of greater
emphasis being raised to an independent noun-clause, while the real principal action is added
as though it were an accompanying circumstance, and hence in the form of an ordinary
circumstantial clause. [Cf. Driver, Tenses, § 166 ff.]

2. According to what has been remarked above, under a, the natural order of
words within the verbal sentence is: Verb—Subject, or Verb—Subject—Object. But as
in the noun-clause (§ 141 l) so also in the verbal-clause, a variation of the usual order
of words frequently occurs when any member of the sentence is to be specially
emphasized by priority of position.1 Thus the order may be:—

(a) Object—Verb—Subject: Gn 30:40, 37:4, 1 S 15:1, 2 K 23:19 and frequently.
Naturally the examples are far more numerous, in which the object precedes a verbal
form which includes the subject in itself, e.g. Gn 3:10, 14, 18, 6:16, 8:17, 9:13, Ex
18:23, Ju 14:3, 1 S 18:17, 20:9, 21:10, 2 K 22:8, Pr 13:5, &c.

(b) Verb—Object—Subject: Gn 21:7, Nu 5:23, 1 S 15:33, 2 S 24:16 (but ????? is

probably only a subsequent addition); Is 19:13, Ps 34:22, Jb 11:19, &c.

1 1 Not infrequently also the striving after chiasmus mentioned in § 114 r, note,
occasions a departure from the usual arrangement of words.

(c) Subject—Object—Verb: Is 3:17, 11:8, 13:18, Ho 12:11, Ps 6:10, 11:5, Jb

29:25.2

(d) Object—Subject—Verb (very rarely): 2 K 5:13, Is 5:17, 28:17, Ps 51:5, Pr

13:16 (read ???).1

(e) A substantival complement of the verb ??? is placed first in Is 18:5  ????? ??????

????? ???????? and a ripening grape the flower becometh.

Rem. Of specifications compounded with a preposition those of place stand regularly
after the verb, unless they are specially emphatic as e.g. Gn 19:2, 30:16, 32:5, Mi 5:1, Est
9:12; in Gn 29:25 ??????? with ?? pretii precedes for the Sake of emphasis. Cf., however, in Gn
35:13 the order verb—specification of place—subject.—The remoter object precedes for the
sake of emphasis, e.g. in Gn 13:15 (263), 15:3; even before the interrogative. Gn 27:37 (cf. Jer
22:15 where the subject precedes an interrogative, and 1 S 20:8, Jb 34:31 where a
prepositional specification precedes). — Prepositional specifications of time, such as ?? ???????
(Gn 1:1), ?????, ????? ?????, &c. (but not ???????????, nor the simple ?????????, ?????????, ???????), stand, as
a rule, before the verb, provided it be not in the perf. consec. or imperf. consec.; so also
certain adverbs of time, such as ??, ?????, whilst others like ???, ?????? regularly follow the verb.

§ 143. The Compound Sentence

A compound sentence (§ 140 d) is formed by the juxtaposition of a subject2

(which always precedes, see c) and

(a) An independent noun-clause, which (a) refers to the principal subject by

means of a pronoun, e.g. Na 1:3 ?????? ??????? ??????? the Lord—in the storm is his way; 2 S
23:6, Ps 18:31, 104:17, 125:2, Ec 2:14; cf. also Gn 34:23, where the predicate is an
interrogative clause.—A personal pronoun is somewhat frequently used as the
principal subject, e.g. Is 59:21 ????? ???????? ???? ???????? and as for me, this is my covenant
with them, &c.; Gn 9:9, 17:4, Is 1:7, 1 Ch 28:2; 3 with an interrogative noun-clause,

2 2 This sequence occurs even in prose (Gn 17:9, 23:6, &c.); it is, however, more
doubtful here than in the above prophetical and poetical passages, whether the
preceding subject should not be regarded rather as the subject of a compound sentence
(§ 143), the predicate of which is an independent verbal-clause; this would explain
why the verbal-clause is usually separated from the subject by one of the greater
disjunctives.—On the other hand, the sequence Subject—Object—Verb is quite
common in Aramaic (e.g. Dn 2:7, 10); cf. Gesenius, Comm. on Is 42:24, and
Kautzsch’s Gramm. des Bibl. Aram., § 84. 1 b. The pure Aramaic usage of placing the
object before the infinitive occurs in Hebrew in Lv 19:9, 21:21, Dt 28:56, 2 S 11:19, Is
49:6, 2 Ch 28:10, 31:7, 36:19 (?).
1 1 This sequence occurs more frequently in noun-clauses with a participial predicate,
e.g. Gn 37:16, 41:9, 2 S 13:4, &c., in interrogative sentences, e.g. 2 K 6:22, Jer 7:19;
in all which cases the emphasized object is placed before the natural sequence of
subject—predicate. [Cf. Driver, Tenses, § 208.]
2 2 In Gn 31:40 a verbal-clause (
then explained by another verbal-clause.
3 3 In 1 Chr 28:2 (cf. also 22:7 ??????????? ????? ?????) ????? might also be taken as strengthening
the pronominal suffix which follows (equivalent to I myself had it in my mind), as e.g.
Ez 33:17 whereas their own way is not equal; cf. § 135 f.

 I was) occurs instead of the subject, and is

????(cid:31)????

Gn 37:30, Jb 21:4, 38:19:—or (?) is without a retrospective suffix (in which case
naturally the connexion between the subject and predicate is much looser), e.g. 1 S
20:23 and as touching the matter which, &c. … behold the Lord is between thee and
me for ever; Pr 27:2.

(b) An independent verbal-clause: (a) with a retrospective suffix,1 e.g. Gn 9:6 (cf.

§ 116 w); 17:15 as for Sarai thy wife, thou shalt not call her name Sarai; 26:15,
28:13, 34:8, Ex 30:37, 32:1, 1 S 2:10, 2 K 10:29, Is 9:1, 11:10, Ez 33:2, Ho 9:11, Ps
11:4, 46:5, 65:4, 74:17, Dn 1:17; with a pronoun as the principal subject, Gn 24:27;
(?) without a retrospective suffix, Is 19:17 every one that mentions it (Judah) to it
(Egypt), it (Egypt) is afraid.

???

Rem. 1. In all the above examples prominence is given to the principal subject (by its
mere separation from the context by means of a greater disjunctive, as a casus pendens2) in a
manner which would be quite impossible in a simple noun or verbal-clause (e.g. Na 1:3 if it
??????? ??????? ???? ); cf. the French c’est moi qu’on a accusé. But the statement or question
were
contained in the clause which forms the predicate also receives greater weight. For the same
purpose other members of the sentence also are sometimes placed at the beginning and
resumed again by a following suffix; thus the object, Gn 13:15, 21:13, 35:12, 47:21 (with the
Samaritan and LXX read perhaps ??????????); 1 S 25:29; a specification of place, Gn 2:17, 2 K
22:18, &c.; a substantive with ??, 1 S 9:20, 2 S 6:23; cf. the examples in § 135 a.—In Nu 15:29
a dative is co-ordinated with the casus pendens, i.e. there is a transition to a different
construction.

2. To compound sentences belong also the numerous examples already treated in the

account of the tenses, where the predicate of a casus pendens is introduced by the w?w
apodosis. The isolation and prominence of the principal subject is in this case still more
marked than in the instances treated above; on the casus pendens with a following imperfect
consecutive (e.g. Jer 6:19, 33:24), cf. § 111 h; with a following perfect consecutive (e.g. Ex
4:21, 12:44, Nu 23:3, 1 S 25:27, 2 S 14:10, Is 9:4, 56:6 f.), §112 t and mm; on the participle
as casus pendens, § 112 oo and § 116 w.—In Jb 15:17 w?w apodosis follows with the
cohortative; in Jb 23:12, Ps 115:7, the imperfect is separated by ??? from the w?w apodosis;
in Jb 4:6 as for thy hope, it is the integrity of thy ways, 36:26, Ec 5:6, an incomplete noun-
clause is appended by w?w apodosis. On w?w apodosis after disconnected specifications of
time, cf. § 112 oo at the end, and Gn 40:9, 2 S 15:34
present is concerned) I will be thy servant, Nu 12:12, Jer 4:1 (me thou needest not fear).

 and now (so far as the

?????? ???????? ???????

???

3. Sometimes a substantive introduced by ?? (in respect to; cf. § 119 u) serves the same
purpose as the casus pendens beginning the sentence, as Nu 18:8 (unless the ?? here serves to
introduce the object, according to § 117 n); Is 32:1 (where, however, ???? ???? should most
probably be read); Ec 9:4, 1 Ch 7:1, 24:20 ff., 2 Ch 7:21. On the other hand, Ps 16:3, 17:4,
32:6, 89:19, 119:91, are very doubtful. The suggestion of P. Haupt (Johns Hopkins University
Circulars, xiii. no. 114; Baltimore, 1894) also deserves attention, that in passages like Ec 9:4,
and in ????? Gn 9:10, 23:10, Ex 27:3, 19, Ez 44:9, &c., ?? is not the preposition, but an

1 1 Cf. the Mêša(cid:31) inscription, l. 31, and ?oronain, therein dwelt, &c.
2 2 But this term must not (any more than that formerly used ‘the subject preceding
absolutely’) be misunderstood to mean that the principal subject is, as it were, floating
in the air, and that the whole sentence results in an anacoluthon. On the contrary, to
the Semitic mind, such sentences appear quite as correctly formed as ordinary noun-
and verbal-clauses.

emphasizing particle, answering to the Arab. l?, surely; Assyrian lû; with ??? it is equivalent
to in short. Cf. also ????? sive—sive, et—et, Jos 17:16, Ezr 1:11, Assyrian lû—lû.

§ 144. Peculiarities in the Representation of the Subject (especially in the Verbal-
clause).

1. According to § 40 ff. most forms of the finite verb include a specification of the

subject in the form of personal afformatives (in the imperfect also in the form of
preformatives). Not infrequently, however, masculine forms are used in referring to
feminines, e.g. ??????????? Ez 23:49; ???? ???? Ru 1:8; in the imperfect, Jo 2:22, Ct 2:7; in the
imperative, Am 4:1, Zc 13:7 (for other examples, see § 110 k). On emphasizing the
pronominal subject by the addition of the separate pronoun, see § 135 a and b.

On the masculine as prior gender, cf. § 122 g; on similar anomalies in the use of the
personal pronoun, § 135 o, in the connexion between substantive and adjective, § 132 d,
between subject and predicate, § 145 p, t, u.

2. The third person singular is often used impersonally, especially in the

?????

??????? ???

 Ju 11:39, Jer 7:31, Ez 12:25, Jb 15:32 (unless ????????? in verse 31 be

masculine, e.g. ???????? and it came to pass, ??????? and it shall come to pass; ????? followed
by ??, &c., it became hot to him, i.e. he became angry, Gn 4:6, &c.;
?? ???  lit. and it
became strait to him, he was distressed, Gn 32:8; 1 also in the feminine, e.g. 1 S 30:6
(Ju 10:9)
the subject); cf. also the impersonal passives, Is 1:6 (???????), 29:6 (???????). Somewhat
different are the instances in which the 3rd singular feminine occurs as the predicate
of a feminine subject which is not mentioned, but is before the mind of the speaker,
e.g. Is 7:7, 14:24, Jer 10:7, Jb 4:5, 18:15 (in 2 K 24:7 ? ???????? is used in this way with
a feminine predicate, and in Jer 19:5 ? ???? alone); different, too, are the instances in
which the 3rd singular masculine refers to an act just mentioned, e.g. Gn 17:11 ???????
and this (the circumcision) shall be a token of a covenant, &c.

?????

Rem. The expressions for natural phenomena may be either in the 3rd sing. masculine or
feminine, e.g. ??? it becomes light, 1 S 29:10 (but with an explicit subject, Gn 44:3); ??????? and
it became light; so also ?? ?????? it grows dark, Jer 13:16; but ??? ??????? Mi 3:6;
be darkness, Jb 11:17; ???????? it rains, Am 4:7 (where, however, the context requires the
reading ???????); Ps 50:3 ????? ???? it is tempestuous.

 though there

????????

3. The indefinite personal subject (our they, one, the French on, and the German

man1) is expressed—

(a) By the 3rd person singular masculine, e.g. ????? one (sc. any one who named it,
see the Rem.) called (or calls) it, Gn 11:9, 16:14, 19:22, Ex 15:23; ????????? Gn 35:8, 10,

1 1 In Arabic and Ethiopic the masculine is commonly used in this case, in Syriac the
feminine.—The forms ??? hot, ??? good, well, ??? bitter, ??? narrow, ??? evil (frequently
joined by ???, ??, &c.), which many regard as impersonal, are no doubt to be regarded
in most cases not as forms of the 3rd pers. sing. perf., but, with Hupfeld on Ps 18:7, as
adjectives.
1 1 In 1 S 9:9 ?????? (prop. the man) is used in exactly the same sense as our one.

????

?????

 one said, Gn 48:1, 1 S 16:4; 2 other examples are Gn 38:28

2 S 2:16, Is 9:5;
one put out a hand; Nu 23:21, 1 K 22:38, Is 6:10 ?? ??????? and one heals them; 8:4
(??????); 46:7 (???????); Am 6:12, Mi 2:4, Jb 27:23; by the 3rd singular feminine (????????) Nu
26:59.

Rem. The Jewish commentators, following the Arab grammarians, usually explain these
singulars by the addition of the participle (generally determinate) of the same stem, e.g.  ?????
???????. This view is supported by the fact that such a complement sometimes occurs, e.g. Is
16:10 ???????? ???????? the treader treads out, for one treads out; 28:4, 24 (doth one plow
continually?); Dt 17:6 (Ez 18:32), Dt 22:8, 2 S 17:9 (Ez 33:4), Jer 9:23; with an indeterminate
participle (as in Arabic, e.g. q?la q?ilun, a sayer says, i.e. some one says), e.g. Nu 6:9, Am
9:1; cf. above, § 116 t, and, on the whole question, Driver on 1 S 16:4.

(b) Very frequently by the 3rd plural masculine, e.g. Gn 29:2 for out of that well
?? ???? they (i.e. people generally) watered the flocks; 26:18, 35:5, 41:14, 49:31, 1 K 1:2,
Is 38:16, Ho 12:9, Jb 18:18, 34:20, Est 2:2, Neh 2:7.

Rem. The 3rd plur. also is sometimes used to express an indefinite subject, where the
context does not admit of a human agent or at least not of several, e.g. Gn 34:27. In such a
case the 3rd plur. comes to be equivalent to a passive, as very commonly in Aramaic (see
Kautzsch’s Gramm. des Bibl. Aram., § 96. 1 c); e.g. Jb 7:3 wearisome nights ???????? have they
allotted to me (equivalent to were allotted to me; to make ‘invisible powers’ the subject is a
merely artificial device); Jb 4:19, 6:2, 18:18, 19:26, 34:20, Ez 32:25, Ps 63:11, Pr 2:22 (in
parallelism with a passive); 9:11.

(c) By the 2nd singular masculine, e.g. Is 7:25

????

?? ??????????

 one will (or can) not

come thither (prop. thou wilt …); Jer 23:37, Pr 19:25, 30:28 (unless the reading
should be ???????). Cf. also ??????????? or simply ??????? (Gn 10:19, 30, 13:10 ????????) prop.
until thy coming, i.e. until one comes.

(d) By the plural of the participle, e.g. Jer 38:23 and all thy wives and thy children

????????? (prop. are they bringing out=) they will bring out, &c.; cf. Is 32:12, Ez 13:7,
Neh 6:10 (for some are coming to slay thee) and the passages discussed above, § 116
t.1 In 1 K 5:1 the text is corrupt.

(e) By the passive, e. g. Gn 4:26 ??????? ????? ?? then (was it begun=) began men to

call upon, &c. (but read ????? ??? he began).

4. A peculiar idiom, and one always confined to poetic language, is the not
infrequent occurrence of two subjects in a verbal sentence,2 one of the person and the

2 2 Elsewhere in such cases ?????????? usually occurs (but not in the perfect, e.g. 1 S
23:22), so that it is doubtful whether the present reading of Gn 48:1, &c., would not
be better explained according to § 7 d, note. In Gn 48:2 for the extraordinary ??????? the
common form ??????? is to be read; so in 50:26 for ? ??????? (after a plural) either ? ?????? or the
3rd plur.; in 2 K 21:26 ??????????.
1 1 That this form of expression also (see g) comes to be equivalent to a passive is
seen from the analogy of such Aramaic passages as Dn 4:22, which exclude any idea
of human agency. Cf. Kautzsch, Gramm. des Bibl. Aram., § 76. 2 e at the end, and in
post.-bibl. Hebrew, e. g. Pirqe Aboth 2, 16; 3, 5, &c.
2 2 Two subjects occur in a noun-clause in Ps 83:19.

other of the thing. The latter then serves—whether it precedes or follows—to state the
instrument, organ, or member by which the action in question is performed, and may
be most often rendered in English by an adverb, as a nearer definition of the manner
of the action. All the examples of this kind have this in common, that the subject
denoting the thing takes a suffix in the same person as the personal subject.3 They are
thus distinguished from the accusatives treated in § 117 s, with which they are often
confused.

(a) Examples where the subject denoting the thing precedes, ????? ??????? ??????????? my voice—
 my mouth—I

I cry unto the Lord, i. e. I cry aloud unto the Lord, Ps 3:5, 27:7, 142:2;
cried, i. e. I cried aloud, Ps 66:17 (cf. 17:10); Is 26:9 ? ?????? with my soul, i. e. fervently, and
parallel with it ????????; but ? ?????? Ps 57:5 is rather a periphrasis for the 1st pers. I.

????
?????????
?

(b) Where the subject denoting the thing follows, ?????? ???????? cry—thy voice (i. e. aloud), Is

10:30; so also after an imperative, Ps 17:13 (
after a perfect, Hb 3:15 (
the thing stands between the personal subject and the predicate in Ps 44:3 ??????? ????.4

); after a cohortative, Ps 108:2 (??????????). The subject denoting

) and verse 14 (???????); 60:7, 108:7 (??????????);

?????????

Rem. 1. Sometimes (as in other languages) an action is ascribed to a subject which can
only have been performed at his direction by another person; cf. e. g. Gn 40:22 (4113), 41:14,
43:34 (and he commanded to set before them, &c.); 46:29, 2 S 12:9.

2. Supposed ellipses of a definite subject are due either to a misunderstanding of the

passage, or to a corruption of the text. Thus in 1 S 24:11 after
(through confusion with
????????
the text is obviously corrupt.

) or we should read with the LXX ???????. In 2 S 13:39 (????? ???????)

????????

 either ?????? has dropped out

3. In poetic (or prophetic) language1 there sometimes occurs (supposing the text to be
correct) a more or less abrupt transition from one person to another. Thus from the 2nd to the
3rd (i. e. from an address to a statement), Gn 49:4 (?), Is 31:6 (?), 42:20, 52:14, 61:7, Mal
2:15 (where, however, for ??????? we should undoubtedly read  ???????
); Ps 22:9 [and regularly
after a vocative, Is 22:16, 47:8, 48:1, 54:1, 11, Jer 22:16, 49:4, 16, Am 5:6f., Mic 1:2 (=1 K
22:28), Mal 3:9, 2 K 9:31; and after ??? Is 5:8, 29:15, Jer 22:13]. From the 3rd to the 2nd
pers., Dt 32:15, Is 1:29 (but read probably ????????? for ?????????, which has caused the insertion of
? ????), 5:8, Jer 29:19, Jb 16:7, cf. also Dt 32:17. From the 1st to the 3rd pers., La 3:1 (in a
relative clause). In Jb 13:28 the 3rd pers. ????? is probably employed ????????? for the 1st.

????(cid:31)?????

 (§ 121 b); in 1 S

3 3 In Ex 6:3 ??? ?? is subordinated to the following passive
25:26, 33 ?????, ??????? are subjects to the infinitive absolute ?? ????, according to § 113 gg. In
Ps 69:11 read ?????????? for ??????????.
4 4 In several of the above examples it might naturally be supposed that the subject
denoting the thing (especially when it follows the verb) is to be explained rather as a
casus instrumentalis, i. e. as an accusative, analogous to the adverbial accusatives in §
118 q. But although it is true that the subject denoting the thing often defines more
closely the manner in which the action is performed, and although in similar (but still
different) examples, Ps 89:2, 109:30, Jb 19:16, ??? occurs with ?? instrumentale, the
explanation given above must nevertheless be accepted.
1 1 In prose, Lv 2:8; but  ???????????
is Gn 26:7, where there is a transition to direct narration.

 here is hardly the original reading. Different from this

§ 145. Agreement between the Members of a Sentence, especially between Subject and
Predicate, in respect of Gender and Number.

1. As in other languages, so also in Hebrew, the predicate in general conforms to
the subject in gender and number (even when it is a pronoun, e. g. ???????? ???? this is my
covenant, Gn 17:10). There are, however, numerous exceptions to this fundamental
rule. These are due partly to the constructio ad sensum (where attention is paid to the
meaning rather than to the grammatical form; see b–l below), partly to the position of
the predicate (regarded as being without gender) before the subject.

2. Singular nouns which include in themselves a collective idea (§ 123 a), or
which occasionally have a collective sense (§ 123 b), may readily, in accordance with
their meaning, be construed with the plural of the predicate, whether it precedes or
follows. This is also the case, when the collective is itself feminine but represents,
exclusively or at least generally, masculine persons.

Examples:—

 ???

 army; Pr 11:26 ????? the people; Nu 10:3 ???????????? all the

(a) Of collectives proper (cf. § 132 g): (?) with the predicate preceding, Gn 30:38
??????

?????
 representing persons belonging to the tribe;

?????? (cf. 30:39, 31:8 and 33:13); Ju 1:22 f.
Mi 4:3 ???; 2 K 25:5
??????
congregation (cf. 1 K 8:5); 1 K 1:40, Is 9:8, 25:3, Am 1:5 ???; 1 S 17:47, Ezr 10:12 ?????
assembly. Cf. also the construction of national names, as ????? (§ 122 i), e. g. 1 K 20:20
??????
?
????? and the Syrians fled; 1 S 4:5.—(?) with the predicate following, 1 K 8:5 ?????? ???? sheep
and oxen, construed with the plural in the following relative clause; Jb 1:14 ???????? ???? ???????
 on
the cattle (cows) were ploughing; 2 S 3:1 and 1 Ch 10:6
the analogy of names of countries, is used for the inhabitants of Bethshemesh); Ho 11:7, Ezr
4:4 ???; Ps 68:11 ????? herd [if correct, figuratively for people]; Is 26:19 ??????? dead bodies; Is
27:11 ?????? boughs; 1 S 4:1 ????? ????, preceded by a predicate in the singular.

?????? =family (in 1 S 6:13

?? ????

(b) Of substantives occasionally used as collectives: (?) with the predicate preceding, Gn

34:24 ?????; Ju 9:55, 15:10 ????; Is 16:4 ????? the treader down.—(?) with the predicate
following, Jb 8:19 ????=others; Ez 28:3 ????? a secret; [Ps 9:7, and even after ??? Jb 19:19.]

(c) Of feminines as collective terms denoting masculine persons: (?) with the predicate
preceding, 1 S 17:46 ?????????? ???????? that all the earth may know, the i. e. all the inhabitants of
).—(?)
the earth; cf. Dt 9:28, Ps 66:1, 96:1, 9, &c.; Am 1:8 ?????? ?? remnant; (Ps 33:8
????
with the predicate following, Gn 41:57, 2 S 15:23, 1 K 10:24, Gn 48:6
 issue; 1 S 2:33
????????
???????????? all the increase; Jb 30:12 ??????? rabble. In Hag 2:7 read ??????? with the LXX.

???????

Examples of predicates in the singular, notwithstanding the collective meaning of the
subject, occur in Gn 35:11, Ex 10:24, 14:10, Dt 1:39, &c.—For examples of bold enallage of
the number in noun-clauses with a substantival predicate, see above, § 141 c.

Rem. Not infrequently the construction begins in the singular (especially when the
predicate precedes; see o below), but is carried on, after the collective subject has been
mentioned, in the plural; e. g. Ex 1:20
waxed very mighty; 33:4.

 and the people multiplied, and

??????????? ????? ???

???? ?????

3. On the other hand, plurals which have a singular meaning (§ 124 a) are
frequently construed with the singular, especially the pluralis excellentiae or
maiestatis (§ g–i; on the union of these plurals with attributes, cf. § 132 h), as ????????
Gn 1:1, 3, &c. (but see the Rem.), ???????? master, Ex 21:4 ???????? master, owner, Ex
21:29; cf., moreover, ?????? with the singular, Jb 16:16 Keth., ????????? Pr 12:10.—So
feminine forms with a masculine meaning are construed with a masculine predicate, e.
g. Ec 12:9

 the preacher was wise.

???? ?????

????? ???

???????

Rem. The construction of ???????? God with the plural of the predicate may be explained
(apart of course from such passages as 1 K 19:2, 20:10, where the speakers are heathen, and
?
 may, therefore, be a numerical plural) partly as an acquiescence in a polytheistic form
of expression, partly from the peculiar usage of one of the early documents of the Hexateuch,
called E by Wellhausen, &c., B by Dillmann; cf. his commentary on Numbers—Joshua, p.
618, and above, § 124 g, note 2. So Gn 20:13 (but in conversation with a heathen); 31:53,
35:7, cf. also Jos 24:19. That this construction was afterwards studiously avoided from fear of
misconception, is shown by such passages as Neh 9:18 compared with Ex 32:4, 8, and 1 Ch
17:21 compared with 2 S 7:23. Cf. Strack’s excursus on Gen 20:13 in Die Genesis, Munich,
1905, p. 77.

4. Plurals of names of animals or things, and of abstracts, whether they be
masculine or feminine, are frequently construed with the feminine singular of the
verbal predicate1 (on the collective sense of the feminine form, cf. § 122 s); thus Jo
1:20 ???????? ??? ?? ???????? the beasts of the field long; Jer 12:4 (where the predicate
precedes), cf. also Jb 12:7; names of things with the predicate preceding occur in 2 S
24:13, Is 34:13, Jer 4:14, 51:29, Ps 18:35, 37:31, 73:2 Keth., 103:5 (unless ?????????? is
to be read for ?????????), Jb 14:19, 27:20; with the predicate following, Gn 49:22
(?????=branches); Dt 21:7, 1 S 4:15 (
48:41, 49:24, Pr 15:22, 20:18, Jb 41:10.3

),2 2 S 10:9, Is 59:12, Jer 2:15 Keth.,

?? ?????????

????

5. Moreover, the plural of persons (especially in the participle) is sometimes
construed with the singular of the predicate, when instead of the whole class of
individuals, each severally is to be represented as affected by the statement.
Undoubted examples of this distributive singular are Gn 27:29 (Nu 24:9)
?????? ???
?
thee, blessed be every one of them; Ex 31:14, Lv 17:14 and 19:8 (in both places the
Samaritan has ???????); Is 3:12 unless
?? ????  is to be regarded as a pluralis maiestatis
???
according to § 124 k; Pr 3:18, 35 (?), 18:21 (?), 21:27b, 27:16, 28:1b, 28:16 Keth.

???????
 those that curse thee, cursed be every one of them, and those that bless

 ???? ???
?

??????????

1 1 Cf. in Greek the construction of the neuter plural with the singular of the predicate
?? ??????? ??????; in Attic Greek the plural of the predicate is allowed only when the
neuter denotes actual persons, as ?? ????????? ??????. In Arabic also the pluralis
inhumanus (i. e. not denoting persons) is regularly construed with the feminine
singular of the attribute or predicate, as are all the plurales fracti (properly collective
forms).
2 2 On the possibility of explaining forms like
§ 44 m; but this explanation would not apply to all the cases under this head, cf. Jo
1:20, Ps 37:31, 103:5.
3 3 In Pr 14:1 an abstract plural ??????? (to be read thus with 9:1, &c., instead of ???????)
is construed with the singular; but cf. § 86 l, § 124 e, end.

 as 3rd plural feminine, cf. above,

??(cid:31)???

Rem. Analogous to the examples above mentioned is the somewhat frequent4 use of
suffixes in the singular (distributively) referring to plurals; cf. the verbal-suffixes in Dt 21:10,
28:48, Am 6:10; and the noun-suffixes in Is 2:8, 30:22, Jer 31:14, Ho 4:8 (but since ? follows,
?????? is undoubtedly a dittography for ??????), Zc 14:12, Ps 5:10 (where, however, ????? is clearly
??????
to be read with all the early versions); 62:5, 141:10 (?), Jb 38:32, Ec 10:15 [but LXX
finally, the suffixes with prepositions in Is 2:20 ???????? ? ???? which they made each one for
himself (according to others, which they (the makers) made for him); 5:26, 8:20, Jb 24:5, in
each case ??; in Gn 2:19 ?? refers to the collectives
?????  and ???; cf. further, Jos 24:7, Is 5:23

6. Subjects in the dual are construed with the plural of the predicate, since verbs,

adjectives, and pronouns, according to § 88 a, have no dual forms; thus
29:17 ????? ???? ???????? and Leah’s eyes were dull; 2 S 24:3, Is 30:20, Jer 14:6, Mi 7:10,
Ps 18:28, 38:11 (on the other hand, in 1 S 4:15 the predicate is in the feminine
singular after the subject, and in Mi 4:11 before it; on both constructions cf. k above);
so also
with the plural masculine ????????; cf. p);
9:14.

7. Variations from the fundamental rule (see above, a) very frequently occur when
the predicate precedes the subject (denoting animals or things1). The speaker or writer
begins with the most simple form of the predicate, the uninflected 3rd singular
masculine, and leaves us without indication as to which of the following subjects (and
so which gender or number) is to define the predicate thus left temporarily indefinite.2
Thus inflexions are omitted in—

(a) The verb, with a following singular feminine, Is 2:17 ??????? ??????? ? ???? and
bowed down shall be the loftiness of man; 9:18, 14:11, 28:18, 47:11; 1 S 25:27 (see
note 1 below); 1 K 8:31b, 22:36, 2 K 3:26, Jer 51:46, Ec 7:7; with a following plural
masc., Is 13:22 ?????? ??????? and there shall cry wolves, &c.; Ju 13:17 Keth., 20:46, 1 S
1:2, 4:10, 2 S 24:15, 1 K 13:33, Jer 51:48, Ps 124:5, Est 9:23 (see note 1 below); Gn
1:14 ??????? ????? let there be lights; with a following plural feminine, Dt 32:35, 1 K
11:3a, Is 8:8, Jer 13:18, Mi 2:6, Ps 57:2; before collectives and mixed subjects, e. g.
Gn 12:16, 13:5, 30:43, 32:6, &c.; before a following dual, Is 44:18, Ps 73:7 (where,
however, with the LXX

 should be read).

????????

Rem. 1. The instances in which a preceding predicate appears in the plural masculine
before a plural (or collective singular) feminine of persons (Ju 21:21, 1 K 11:3b), of animals
(Gn 30:39 where however ???? may refer specially to male animals) or of things (Lv 26:33,
Jer 13:16, Ho 14:7, Ps 16:4, Jb 3:24, Ct 6:9), or before a dual (2 S 4:1, Zp 3:16, 2 Ch 15:7) are

4 4 In several of the above examples the text is doubtful, and hence Mayer Lambert
(REJ. xxiv. 110) rejects the theory of distributive singulars generally. [Cf. Driver,
Jeremiah, p. 362, on 16:7.]
1 1 Only rarely does an uninflected predicate precede a personal subject, as 1 S 25:27
 should probably be read, as in verse 35); Est 9:23 (before a plur. mass.).
(but
Such examples as Jb 42:15 are to be explained according to § 121 a.
2 2 In a certain sense this is analogous to the German es kommt ein Mann, eine Frau,
&c.

????(cid:31)???

to be explained not on the analogy of the examples under o, but from a dislike of using the
3rd plur. fem. imperf., for this is the only form concerned in the above examples (cf.,
however, Na 3:11 ????? instead of ????????); cf. the examples of a following predicate in the 3rd
plur. masc., instead of the fem., under t and u, and on an analogous phenomenon in the
imperative, see § 110 k.

2. As in the case of verbs proper so also the verb ?????, when used as a copula, frequently

remains uninflected before the subject; cf. Gn 5:23 ff., 39:5, Dt 21:3 (according to the
accents); 22:23, Is 18:5 ????? ???????? ????? ?????? and a ripening grape the flower becometh.

 upright are thy
(b) The adjective in a noun-clause, e. g. Ps 119:137
judgements; cf. verse 155.1—On the other hand, ????? in
 thy servants
are shepherds, Gn 47:3, is either an unusual orthography or simply a misspelling for
?????.

???? ???? ? ????
?????? ???? ?????

????
????

Rem. 1. As soon as a sentence which begins with an uninflected predicate is carried on

after the mention of the subject, the gender and number of the subsequent (co-ordinate)
predicates must coincide with those of the subject, e. g. Gn 1:14
 (see o
above); Nu 9:6, Ez 14:1; cf. also Gn 30:39 (see p above).

 ??????? ?????

??????

 ...

2. The dislike mentioned in p above, of using the feminine form (cf., further, § 144 a,

with the sections of the Grammar referred to there, and below, under u), is exemplified
sometimes by the fact that of several predicates only that which stands next to the feminine
substantive is inflected as feminine (cf. the treatment of several attributes following a
feminine substantive, § 132 d); thus in Is 14:9 ????????, and afterwards ????? (but ????? is better
taken as an infin. abs.=excitando, reading ????? for ??????); 33:9
languisheth the land. Cf. Jer 4:30, Jb 1:19, and the examples (§ 47 k) where only the first of
several consecutive forms of the 2nd sing. fem. imperf. has the afformative ?(cid:31), Is 57:8, Jer
3:5, Ez 22:4, 23:32 (???????? after ??? ????); on the converse sequence of genders in imperatives, Na
3:15, cf. § 110 k.—Of a different kind are instances like Lv 2:1, 5:1, 20:6, where
??????  person
(fem.) as the narrative continues, assumes (in agreement with the context) the sense of a
masculine person.

?? ????????? ????

3. The instances in which the gender or number of the following predicate appears to
differ from that of the subject are due partly to manifest errors in the text, e. g. Gn 32:9 read
with the Samaritan ???????? instead of ???????; ??????? then follows correctly; 1 S 2:20 read with
Wellhausen ??? ??, according to 1:28, instead of ?? ??; 1 S 16:4 read ??????????; Ez 18:29 instead of
??????? read the plural as in verse 25; so also Ez 20:38 for ?????, 2 and in Jb 6:20 for
5:10 read ???????, and cf. in general, § 7 d, note; 1 Ch 2:48 read ????????; in Jer 48:15 also the text is
certainly corrupt. Other instances are due to special reasons. The anomalies in Is 49:11, Ho
14:1, Pr 1:16 (after ????????), Ps 11:4 (after ???????), 63:4, Pr 5:2, 10:21, 32 18:6, 26:23, Jb 15:6 (all
), Pr 3:2 (after ????????), Ps 102:28, Jb 16:22 (after ??? ??), Dn 11:41 (read ???????), and
after
perhaps Gn 20:17 are also to be explained (see p) from the dislike of the 3rd plur. fem.
imperf.; moreover, in Jer 44:19, Pr 26:23 the plur. masc. even of a participle occurs instead of
the plur. fem.—In Gn 31:8 f. ????????, after a plural subject, is explained as a case of attraction to

???? ??????

; in La

??????

1 1 This does not include such cases as Jb 24:7, 10, where ????? is rather to be
explained as an accusative denoting a state, § 118 n.
2 2 ???? probably an error for ????. The Masora on Lv 11:34 reckons fourteen instances
of ?????, where we should expect the plural.

the following singular predicate.3—In Gn 4:7 ????? is a substantival participle (a lurker, a
coucher). In Gn 47:24 ???????? remains undefined in gender (masc.), although the noun precedes
for the sake of emphasis; so also in Gn 28:22, Ex 12:49, 28:7, 32, Nu 9:14, 15:29, Jer 50:46,
Ec 2:7 (??? ????? as if the sentence began afresh, and servants born in my house … there fell to
my lot this possession also). In Jb 20:26 ?????????? may (unless ??? is regarded as masculine, §
122 o) be taken impersonally, fire, without its being blown upon.—In Is 16:8 and Hb 3:17 the
predicate in the singular is explained from the collective character of ????? ?? (see h above); on
the other hand, the masculine form of the predicate is abnormal in Ps 87:3, Pr 2:10, 12:25,
29:25, Jb 8:7, 36:18.

§ 146. Construction of Compound Subjects.

1. When the subject is composed of a nomen regens (in the construct state) with a
following genitive, the predicate sometimes agrees in gender and number not with the
nomen regens, but with the genitive, when this represents the principal idea of the
compound subject.1 Thus 1 S 2:4
broken, as if it were the mighty men with their bow are broken; Ex 26:12, Lv 13:9, 1
K 1:41 (but the text is clearly very corrupt), 17:16, Is 2:11, 21:17, Zc 8:10, Jb 15:20,
21:21, 29:10, 32:7 (???? ?? ??? equivalent to many years); 38:21; with the predicate
preceding, 2 S 10:9, unless it is to be explained according to § 145 k.

?????? ???????? ? ??  the bow of the mighty men is

???

Rem. 1. The cases in which ??? (voice, sound) with a following genitive stands at the
beginning of a sentence, apparently in this construction, are really of a different kind. The ???
is there to be taken as an exclamation, and the supposed predicate as in apposition to the
genitive, e. g. Gn 4:10 the voice of thy brother’s blood, which crieth (prop. as one crying)
…!=hark! thy brother’s blood is crying, &c.; Is 13:4, 66:6. In Is 52:8 an independent verbal-
clause follows the exclamation the voice of thy watchmen!; in Jer 10:22 and Ct 2:8 an
independent noun-clause; in Is 40:3 ????? ??? the voice of one that crieth! i. e. hark! there is
one crying is followed immediately by direct speech; in Mi 6:9  ???  hark! may be used
disconnectedly (cf. the almost adverbial use of ??? in § 144 m) and ??????? be taken as the
subject to ???????.

2. When the substantive ??? (????) entirety is used in connexion with a genitive as subject

of the sentence, the predicate usually agrees in gender and number with the genitive, since ???
is equivalent in sense to an attribute (whole, all) of the genitive; hence, e. g. with the predicate
preceding, Gn 5:5 ???? ????????? ????????? and all the days of Adam were, &c. (in 5:23, 9:29, ???????; but
the Samaritan reads ????? here also); Ex 15:20; with the predicate following, Ps 150:6, &c.
Exceptions are, e. g. Lv 17:14 (but cf. § 145 l), Jos 8:25, Is 64:10, Pr 16:2, Na 3:7. On the
other hand, in such cases as Ex 12:16 the agreement of the predicate with ???? is explained
from the stress laid upon the latter, ??? ???????????? being equivalent to the whole of work (is
forbidden).

2. When the subject of the sentence consists of several nouns connected by w?w

copulative, usually

3 3 So also the pronoun ??? emphatically resuming the subject (see § 141 h) is
 the offerings
attracted to the predicate in number in Jos 13:14
of the Lord … that is his inheritance; in number and gender, Lv 25:33 Qerê; Jer 10:3.
1 1 Sometimes, however, the attraction of the predicate to the genitive may be merely
due to juxtaposition.

????

(b) The predicate preceding two or more subjects may likewise be used in the

plural (Gn 40:1, Jb 3:5, &c.); not infrequently, however, it agrees in gender and
number with the first, as being the subject nearest to it. Thus the predicate is put in the
singular masculine before several masculines singular in Gn 9:23, 11:29, 21:32,
24:50, 34:20, Ju 14:5; before a masculine and a feminine singular, e. g. Gn 3:8, 24:55
then said (
) her brother and her mother; 33:7; before a masculine singular and a
plural, e. g. Gn 7:7 ??????? ???? ??????? and Noah went in, and his sons, &c.; Gn 8:18 (where
feminines plural also follow); 44:14, Ex 15:1, 2 S 5:21; before collectives feminine
and masculine, 2 S 12:2.

?????

?????? ????? ???

Similarly, the feminine singular occurs before several feminines singular, e. g. Gn
 then answered Rachel and Leah; before a feminine singular and a

31:14
feminine plural, e. g. Gn 24:61; before a feminine singular and a masculine singular,
Nu 12:1 ????????? ??????? ????????? then spake Miriam and Aaron; Ju 5:1; before a feminine
singular and a masculine plural, e. g. Gn 33:7 (cf., on the other hand, Ps 75:4  ????????
????

44:25 for ???? ????? ???? read ?? ?????? ???? with the LXX, and cf. verse 19.

(c) When other predicates follow after the subjects have been mentioned, they are

necessarily put in the plural; cf. Gn 21:32, 24:61, 31:14, 33:7, &c., and § 145 s.

§ 147. Incomplete Sentences.

1. Sentences are called incomplete, in which either the subject or the predicate or

beth must in some way be supplied from the context.1 Besides the instances
enumerated in § 116 s (omission of the personal pronoun when subject of a participial
clause) and the periphrases for negative attributes § 152 u, this description includes
certain (noun-) clauses introduced by ????? (see b below), and also a number of
exclamations of the most varied kinds (see c below).

1 1 Similarly with a mixed object, Gn 33:2 he put … Leah and her children ??????????
after; ?????????? agrees with the masculine immediately preceding.
1 1 This does not apply to such cases as Gn 33:8, where an infinitive with ?? appears
alone in answer to a question, the substance of the question being presupposed as a
main clause; cf. also Gn 26:7, where ???? must again be supplied after ??? ????.

Rem. Incomplete sentences are very common in Chronicles, but are mostly due to the bad

condition of the text; cf. Driver, Introd.6, p. 537, no. 27. Thus in 2 Ch 11:22b restore ? ????,
with the LXX, before ???????????; in 35:21 add
???? , with the LXX, after ????? and read ????? for
????; in 2 Ch 19:6 and 28:21 the pronoun ??? is wanted as subject, and in 30:9 the predicate
???????; cf. also the unusual expressions in 1 Ch 9:33 (Ezr 3:3), 1 Ch 15:13 (ye were not
present?), 2 Ch 15:3, 16:10, 12 (bis), 18:3.

???

2. The demonstrative particle ???, ????? en, ecce may be used either absolutely (as a

kind of interjection, cf. § 105 b) before complete noun-or verbal-clauses, e. g. Gn
28:15 ?????? ??????? ??????? and, behold! I am with thee; 37:7, 48:21, Ex 3:13, 34:10, or may
take the pronoun, which would be the natural subject of a noun-clause, in the form of
a suffix, see § 100 o. Whether these suffixes are to be regarded as in the accusative
has been shown to be doubtful in § 100 p. However, in the case of ????? the analogy of
the corresponding Arabic demonstrative particle ’inna (followed by an accusative of
the noun) is significant.2 If ????? with a suffix and a following adjective or participle
(see the examples in § 116 p and q) forms a noun-clause, the subject proper, to which
????? with the suffix refers, must, strictly speaking, be supplied again before the
predicate.3 Sometimes, however, the pronoun referring to the subject is wanting, and
 behold
the simple ????? takes the place of the subject and copula (as Gn 189
she is in the tent; 42:28), or there is no indication whatever of the predicate, so that
the sentence is limited to ????? with the suffix, as in the frequent use of
 here
am I, in answer to an address. Elsewhere a substantive follows ????? (or ??? Gn 11:6, Jb
31:35), and ????? then includes the meaning of a demonstrative pronoun and the copula,
e. g. Gn 22:7 ??????????? ????? ????? here is the fire and the wood, &c.; 12:19 behold thou
hast thy wife! Ex 24:8; with reference to the past, e. g. Am 7:1
 and lo, it
was the latter growth, &c. By a very pregnant construction the simple ????? is used as
the equivalent of a sentence in Jb 9:19, lo, here am I!

???? ?????

3. Examples of exclamations (threatening, complaining, triumphing, especially

warlike or seditious) in which, owing to the excitement of the speaker, some
indispensable member of the sentence is suppressed, are—(a) with suppression of the
predicate (which has frequently to be supplied in the form of a jussive), e. g. Ju 7:20 a
?????? ); 2 S 20:1 and 2 Ch 10:16
sword for the Lord and for Gideon! (verse 18 without
(cf. also 1 K 22:36) every man to his tents, O Israel! (i. e. let every man go to or
remain in his tent); without ???? 1 K 12:16; moreover, Is 1:28, 13:4 (on the
exclamatory ??? equivalent to hark! cf. § 146 b); 28:10, 29:16 (????????? O your
perversity! i. e. how great it is!); Jer 49:16 (if ???????????? be equivalent to terror be upon
thee!); Jo 4:14, Mal 1:13 (???????? ????? behold what a weariness!); Jb 22:29; perhaps
also Gn 49:4

 a bubbling over as water (sc. happened), unless it is better to

???? ???

????

???

2 2 On the same analogy any substantive following ????? would have to be regarded as
originally a virtual accusative. Since, however, Hebrew does not possess case-
terminations (as the Arabic does, and uses the accusative necessarily after ’inna), it is
very doubtful whether, and how far, substantives following  ?????  were felt to be
accusatives.
3 3 That these are real noun-clauses and that the participle (e. g. ??? in ??? ?????? Gn 20:8)
cannot be taken as a second accusative (as it were ecce te moriturum), is also shown
by the analogy of Arabic, where after ’inna with an accusative the predicate is
expressly in the nominative.

supply a subject ???? (thou wast).—(b) With suppression of the subject, Ju 4:20, cf. §
152 k; Jb 15:23 ???? where sc. is bread?—(c) With suppression of both subject and
predicate, Ju 7:18 (see above); 1 K 12:16 (see above); 2 K 9:27 ???? ??? him also!
explained immediately afterwards by ?????? smite him! Ho 5:8 after thee, Benjamin! sc.
is the enemy (differently in Ju 5:14); Ps 6:4, 90:13, Hb 2:6 ?????????; Ps 74:9 ???????.—On
????? and if not (unless ???? is to be read), 2 S 13:26, 2 K 5:17, see § 158 dd.

Rem. 1. To the class of incomplete sentences naturally belong exclamations introduced by

interjections ?????, ???, ???, ???; 1 cf. § 105. After the first two the object of the threat or
imprecation follows regularly with ?? (cf. vae tibi) or ???? or ????, e. g.
4:8, Is 6:5; cf. also ????? ????? alas for the day! Jo 1:15; on the other hand, the object of
commiseration (after ???) follows mostly in the vocative, or rather in the accusative of
exclamation (cf. vae te in Plautus); so in lamentation for the dead, ???? ??? alas, my brother! 1
K 13:30, Jer 22:18; ????? ??? ??? ah, sinful nation! Is 1:4, 5:8, 11, 18, 20, 22 (ah! they that
…).— For ??? cf. Hb 2:20, Zp 1:7, Zc 2:17.

 woe unto us! 1 S

2. Finally, instances of noun-clauses shortened in an unusual manner may perhaps occur

in ???????? and ?????????? Ps 115:7, for
Perhaps also ??????????? Gn 22:24, and ???????? Ec 5:16 are to be regarded in the same way, but
hardly ??????????? Nu 12:6; cf. § 128 d above.

Special Kinds of Sentences.

§ 148. Exclamations.

The originally interrogative ??? is used to introduce exclamations of wonder or
indignation = O how! or ridicule, why! how! sometimes strengthened by ??? or ????
according to § 136 c.—Astonishment or indignation at something which has happened
is introduced by ????? how (likewise originally interrogative) with the perfect; the
indignant refusal of a demand by ????? (but also by ??? Jb 31:1) with the imperfect; an
exclamation of lamentation by ??????, less frequently ????? how!; in Jo 1:18 by ???.

Examples:—

??? (or ???? with a following Dag?, see § 37) expressing admiration (or astonishment)
before verbal-clauses, e.g. Gn 27:20 (???????); 38:29, Nu 24:5 (how goodly are …!); Ps 21:2, Ct
7:2; before the predicate of noun-clauses, e.g. Gn 28:17, Ps 8:2; mockingly before the verb, 2
S 6:20 (how glorious was …!); Jer 22:23, Jb 26:2 f.; indignantly, Gn 3:13 ????????; 4:10, 20:9,
31:26 what hast thou done!

????? with the perfect, e.g. Gn 26:9, Ps 73:19; in scornful exclamation, Is 14:4, 12; in a

lament (usually ??????), 2 S 1:25, 27; with the imperfect, in a reproachful question, Gn 39:9,
44:8, Ps 11:1, 137:4; in a mocking imitation of lament, Mi 2:4.

?????? with the perfect, Is 1:21, La 1:1; with the imperfect, La 2:1, 4:1.

Rem. 1. The close relation between a question and an exclamation appears also in the

interrogative personal pronoun ??? in such cases as Mi 7:18  ??? ???????

????

 who is a God like unto

1 1 We do not consider here the cases in which these interjections (e. g. ??? Ju. 3:19,
Am 6:10) stand quite disconnectedly (so always ?? and ????).

thee? and so in general in rhetorical questions as the expression of a forcible denial; similarly
in the use of an interrogative sentence to express a wish, see § 150 d, 151 a.

2. A weaker form of exclamation is sometimes produced by the insertion of a
corroborative ??? verily, surely, before the predicate, Gn 18:20; cf. 33:11, Is 7:9, and the
analogous cases in the apodoses of conditional sentences, § 159 ee.

§ 149. Sentences which express an Oath or Asseveration.

The particle ???, in the sense of certainly not, and ??????? (rarely ??? Gn 22:16) in the

sense of certainly, are used to introduce promises or threats confirmed by an oath
(especially after such formulae as ???????????, ?? ???????????, 1  ? ???
, &c., as well as
,
after imprecations, see below), and also simple asseverations, e.g. 1 S 2:30, 2 S 20:20,
 far be it from me, but mostly without any introductory formula.
Jb 27:5 after

?? ???? ???

??? ????

?????

????

?

?????

Rem. No certain explanation of these particles has yet been given. According to the usual
view, phrases expressing an oath depend on the suppression of an imprecation upon oneself,
e.g. the Lord do so unto me, if I do it equivalent to I certainly will not do it; then naturally
??????? properly if I do it not equivalent to I certainly will do it. It is indeed difficult to
understandsuch self-imprecations, put into the mouth of God, as in Dt 1:34 f., Is 14:24, 22:14,
Jer 22:6, Ez 3:6, 35:6, Ps 95:11. Possibly, however, the consciousness of the real meaning of
the formula was lost at an early period, and ??????? simply came to express verily, ??? verily
not.—In 1 S 25:22, where, instead of a self-imprecation, a curse is pronounced upon others,
read ??????? with the Lxx for ????? ??????????.

Examples:—

(a) The particles ??? and ??????? used after the utterance of an oath and after formulae of

?

?????? ????? ???????????

????? ??????????? ? ??????????? ??

swearing, e.g. 2 S 11:11 (see note on a)
liveth, and as ray soul liveth, I will not do this thing; 1 S 14:45, 2 K 5:16 (after ??????? ???; in 1 S
14:39 and 29:6 ?????? is followed by a simple  ??? ); Ct 2:7, 3:5 (after
also Gn 14:23, 21:23, 26:29; spoken by God, Dt 1:34 f., 1 S 3:14, Ps 95:11; similarly ???????
Gn 24:37 f.; spoken by God, Is 14:24, where ??????? occurs first with the perfect in the sense
of a prophetic perfect, § 106 n, but in the parallel clause with the imperfect; Jer 226; in Gn
31:52 the negative oath introduced by  ?????
, ???????? is immediately afterwards continued by
??? with the imperfect.—In Ez 34:10 the threat introduced in verse 8 by ??????? is, after a long
parenthesis, resumed with ???????.

?????

(b) ??? and ??????? after formulae of cursing, e.g. 1 S 3:17  ?????? ????? ???????? ?????? ??????? ???

 God do so to thee, and more also! thou shalt not hide anything from me,

??? ????? ???
???? ???????????
?
&c.; cf. 1 S 25:22. On the other hand, ??? follows the curse, in 1 S 14:44, 1 K 2:23 (here with a
perfect), and in 2 S 3:35 ??? ???; in 1 S 25:34 the preceding ??? is repeated before ???; in 1 S
20:13 the purport of the asseveration is repeated (after the insertion of a conditional sentence)
in the perfect consecutive.

1 1 Also combined
(i.e. thou) liveth! (Also in 2 S 11:11 read ???????? instead of the impossible

§ 150. Interrogative Sentences.

H. G. Mitchell, ‘The omission of the interrogative particle,’ in Old Test. and Sem. Studies
in memory of W. R. Harper, Chicago, 1907, i, 113 ff.

???? ???????? ??? ??

 Saul shall reign over us? 1 S 22:7, 2 S 16:17, 18:29

1. A question need not necessarily be introduced by a special interrogative
pronoun or adverb. Frequently1 the natural emphasis upon the words is of itself
sufficient to indicate an interrogative sentence as such; cf. Gn 27:24 ? ???? ????? ??? ????
thou art my son Esau? (but cf. note 1 below) Gn 18:12, Ex 33:14 (?? ?????); 1 S 11:12
(cid:31)???
 is it
well with the young man? (but cf. note 1); 1 S 16:4, 1 K 1:24, Is 28:28, Ho 4:16, Zc
8:6 (should it also be marvellous in mine eyes?); Pr 5:16. So especially, when the
interrogative clause is connected with a preceding sentence by ??, e.g. Jn 4:11  ??? ????????
???? and I should not have pity? Ex 8:22 will they not stone us? Ju 11:23, 14:16, 1 S
20:9, 24:20, 25:11, 2 S 11:11, 15:20, Is 37:11, 4419 b, Jer 25:29, 45:5, 49:12, Ez 20:31,
Jb 2:10, 10:9; or when (as in some of the examples just given) it is negative (with ???
for ????? nonne?), 2 K 5:26 (but cf. note 1), La 3:38.2

???? ??? ??

????

Rem. The statement formerly made here that the interrogative particle is omitted
especially before gutturals, cannot be maintained in view of Mitchell’s statistics (op. cit. p.
123 f.). The supposed considerations of euphony are quite disproved by the 118 cases in
which ?? or ?? occurs before a guttural.

2. As a rule, however, the simple question is introduced by He interrogative ?? (??;
as to its form, cf. § k–n), ne? num? the disjunctive question by ?? (num? utrum?) in the
first clause, and ???3 (also ?????, less frequently ??) an? in the second, e.g. 1 K 22:15

1 1 Mitchell (op. cit.) restricts the number of instances to 39, of which he attributes 12
(or 17) to corruption of the text. Thus in Gn 27:24 he would road, with the Samaritan,
??????? as in verso 21, in 1 S 16:4 ??? ????, in 2 S 18:29 ??? ???? as in verse 32; similarly he
would read the interrogative particle in 2 K 5:26, Ez 11:3, Jb 40:25, 41:1; 1 S 30:8, 2
K 9:19, Ez 11:13, 17:9.
2 2 But in 1 S 27:10 instead of ??? (which according to the usual explanation would
expect a negative answer) read either ??????? (???????) with the LXX, or better, ?? ( (cid:31)???? )
whither? with the Targum. In 2 S 23:5 read ????? ??????? with Wellhausen.
3 3 Quite exceptional is the use of the particle ???? num? (common in Aramaic) in 1 S
21:9 ??????? ?????? num est hic? The text is, however, undoubtedly corrupt; according to
Wellhausen, Text der Bücher Sam., the LXX express the reading ????? ?????; but cf. the
full discussion of the passage by König, ZAW. xviii. 239 ff.—The above does not
apply to interrogative sentences introduced by interrogative pronouns (§ 37) or by the
 why? (see §
interrogatives compounded with ??? what? such as ????? how many?
102 k), ?????? why? (§ 99 e), or by ???? where? ?????, ?????? how? (§ 148), &c. On the
transformation of pronouns and adverbs into interrogative words by means of a
prefixed ???, see the Lexicon.

 ...

?????? ???

 ????????

?????

The particular uses are as follows:—

(a) The particle ?? stands primarily before the simple question, when the questioner is
wholly uncertain as to the answer to be expected, and may be used either before noun-clauses,
e.g. Gn 43:7 ?? ????? ????? ??? ???????? ????? is your father yet alive? have ye another brother? for ?????
cf. Gn 24:23, 1 S 9:11; for ????? is it that? Jb 6:22; for ???? ????? is there yet? 2 S 9:1 (but in 2 S
23:19 for ????? read ???? with 1 Ch 11:25); for ?????? is there not? 1 K 22:7, &c.; or before verbal-
clauses, e.g. Jb 2:3 hast thou considered (
num?) is used before questions, to which, from their tone and contents, a negative answer is
expected, e.g. Jb 14:14 if a man die, ?????????? shall he indeed live again? Sometimes a question is
so used only as a rhetorical form instead of a negative assertion, or of a surprised or indignant
refusal,2 e.g. 2 S 7:5 ????? ??????????? ??????? shalt thou build me an house? (in the parallel passage 1
 am I my brother’s keeper? cf.
Ch 17:4 ??? ???? ??? thou shalt not, &c.); Gn 4:9
2 K 5:7, and the two passages where ?? is used before the infinitive (constr. Jb 34:18, absol. Jb
40:2; on both, see § 113 ee, with the note).—On the other hand, in 1 K 16:31 for ??????? (after
???????) read ???????.

) my servant Job? In other cases ?? (=

??? ???? ???????

?????? ????

?????

????

Rem. 1. A few passages deserve special mention, in which the use of the interrogative is
altogether different from our idiom, since it serves merely to express the conviction that the
contents of the statement are well known to the hearer, and are unconditionally admitted by
him. Thus, Gn 3:11 surely thou hast eaten; Gn 27:36 ????? ????? prop. is it so that one names?
&c., i.e. of a truth he is rightly named Jacob; Gn 29:15 verily thou art my brother; Dt 11:30,
Ju 4:6, I S 2:27 I did indeed, &c.; 20:37, 1 K 22:3 ye know surely …; Mi 3:1, Jb 20:4.—In 1 S
23:19 (cf. Ps 54:2) a surprising communication is introduced in this way (by ?????) in order to
show it to be absolutely true, and in Am 9:7 a concession is expressed by ????? I have, it is
true, &c. Finally, we may include the formula of quotation ??????? ???? ????? Jos 10:13 or
???????? ????????? equivalent to surely it is, they are written (the latter in 1 K 11:41, 14:29, and
very often elsewhere in the books of Kings and Chronicles), synonymous with the simple
formula of assertion ??????? ????? 2 S 1:18, and ???????? ????? 1 K 14:19, 2 K 15:11, 2 Ch 27:7,
32:32.

Of very frequent occurrence also are questions introduced by

?????? , which really contain

an affirmation and are used to state the reason for a request or warning, e.g. 2 S 2:22 turn thee
aside … wherefore should I smite thee to the ground? i.e. otherwise I will (or must) smite,
&c.; cf. 1 S 19:17, and Driver on the passage; 2 Ch 25:16; also Gn 27:45, Ex 32:12 (Jo 2:17,
Ps 79:10, 115:2); Ct 1:7, Ec 5:5, 7:17, Dn 1:10.

2. The rare cases in which a simple question is introduced by ??? (as sometimes in Latin
by an? is it?) are really due to the suppression of the first member of a double question; thus 1
K 1:27, Is 29:16, Jb 6:12, 39:13.

1 1 On the use of the imperfect in deliberative questions, see § 107 t; on the perfectum
confidentiae in interrogative sentences, see § 106 n.
2 2 Analogous to this is the use of the interrogative ??? in the sense of a reproachful
remonstrance instead of a prohibition, as Ct 8:4 ??????????? why should ye stir up? i.e.
pray, stir not up; cf. also Jb 31:1; see above, § 148.

(b) Disjunctive questions are, as a rule, introduced by ???—?? (utrum—an?) or sometimes

by ?????1—??, e.g. Jo 1:2, Jb 21:4 (even with ?? repeated after ????? in a question which implies
disbelief, Gn 17:17). In Jb 34:17, 40:8 f. special emphasis is given to the first member by ????
prop. is it even? The second member is introduced by ?? or in 2 K 6:27, Jb 16:3, 38:28, 31:36
(Mal 1:8
combination ?? ???; cf. also Ju 18:19, Ec 2:19.

), in each case before ?  , and hence no doubt for euphonic reasons, to avoid the

????

Double questions with (?????) ???—?? need not always be mutually exclusive; frequently the

disjunctive form serves (especially in poetic parallelism; but cf. also e.g. Gn 37:8) merely to
repeat the same question in different words, and thus to express it more emphatically. So Jb
4:17 shall mortal man be just before God? or (???) shall a man be pure before his Maker? Jb
6:5 f., 8:3, 10:4 f., 11:2, 7, 22:3, Is 10:15, Jer 5:29. The second member may, therefore, just as
well be connected by a simple ??, e.g. Jb 13:7, 15:7 f., 38:16 f.22, 32, 39; cf. also Ps 8:5 after
???; Jb 21:17 f. after ?????; or even without a conjunction, Jb 8:11, 22:4; after ??? Ps 144:3.

(c) With regard to indirect questions2 after verbs of inquiring, doubting, examining,3 &c.,
simple questions of this kind take either ?? whether, Gn 8:8, 4 or ??? Gn 15:5, 2 K 1:2, Ct 7:13;
even before a noun-clause, Jer 5:1; in 1 S 20:10 the indirect question is introduced by ??, i.e.
probably if perchance. In disjunctives (whether—or) ???—?? Nu 13:18 at the end (or ???????—??
Gn 24:21, 27:21, 37:32, Ex 16:4), and ??—?? Nu 13:18, which is followed by ???—??; also ??—??
Ec 2:19. The formula ??? ?????? ??? has an affirmative force, who knows whether … not, like the
Latin nescio an, Est 4:14.

In Jon 1:7, 8 the relative pronouns  ??·

 and ? ???? owing to the following ????? have become

also interrogative, for whose cause?

(d) ??? and ??? (cf. § 136 c) immediately after the interrogative serve to give vividness to
the question; so also ????? (for which ???? five times in Job) then, now, Gn 27:33 ??? ??????????
who then is he? Ju 9:38, Is 19:12, Jb 17:15; ???? ???? where then is …? However, ????? may also
be placed at the end of the entire question (Ex 33:16, Is 22:1; also Ho 13:10, since either ????? is
a dialectical form of ????, or ???? should be read instead of it) or at the beginning of the question
proper, after a strongly emphasized word, as in Gn 27:37.1

1 1 ????? occurs in Pr 27:24 after a negative statement; we should, however, with
Dyserinck read ??????. Not less irregular is ????? instead of ??? ??? in the second clause of
Ju 14:15, but the text can hardly be correct (cf. Moore, Judges, New York, 1895, p.
337); in 1 S 23:11 the second ?? introduces a fresh question which is only loosely
connected with the first.—In Nu 17:28 and in the third clause of Jb 6:13, ????? is best
taken with Ewald in the sense of ?????, since ??? from its use in oaths (see above, § 149
b) may simply mean verily not.
2 2 It should here be remarked that the distinction between direct and indirect
questions cannot have been recognized by the Hebrew mind to the same extent as it is
in Latin or English. In Hebrew there is no difference between the two kinds of
sentence, either as regards mood (as in Latin) or in tense and position of the words (as
in English). Cf. also § 137 c.
3 3 In Gn 43:6 the ?? after ???????? is explained from the fact that the latter, according to
the context, implies to give information upon a question.
4 4 Also in Ec 3:21 we should read ???????? and
the article which is assumed by the Masora.
1 1 On the other hand, in Jb 9:24 and 24:25 ???? is not prefixed to the ???, but appended
to the conditional sentence.

 (whether—whether) instead of

(cid:31)?????(cid:31)???

(e) Sometimes one interrogative governs two co-ordinate clauses, the first of which
should rather be subordinated to the second, so that the interrogative word strictly speaking
affects only the second; thus Is 5:4 after ?????? wherefore looked I … and it brought forth? i.e.
wherefore brought it forth, while I looked, &c.; Is 50:2; after ?? Nu 32:6, Jer 8:4, also Nu
 Is 40:25.2 But
16:22 (read ??????); after ????? Jos 22:20; after
?? Jb 4:2 and ????? 4:21 are separated from the verb to which they belong by the insertion of a
conditional clause.

??????  Is 58:3, 2 Ch 32:4; after

????

???

3. The affirmative answer is generally expressed, as in Latin, by repeating the
emphatic word in the question (or with the second person changed to the first, Gn
24:58, 27:24, 29:5, Ju 13:11), Gn 29:6, 37:32 f., 1 S 23:11, 26:17, 1 K 21:10, Jer
37:17. (On ????? if it be so in the corrected text of 2 K 10:15, see § 159 dd.) As a
negative answer the simple ??? is sometimes sufficient, as in Gn 19:2, 1 K 3:22, &c.;
cf. § 152 c; and in Ju 4:20 the simple ????? equivalent to no or no one.

§ 151. Desiderative Sentences.

A wish may be expressed not only by the simple imperfect (§ 107 n), cohortative
(§ 108, especially with ??? § 108 c), jussive (§ 109; with ??? § 109 b), imperative (§ 110
a), perfect consecutive (§ 112 aa) or by a simple noun-clause (§ 116 r, note, and § 141
g) but also in the following ways:—

1. By exclamations in the form of interrogative clauses:3 especially sentences with

??? followed by the imperfect as being the mood of that which is still unfulfilled but
possible, and hence also of that which is desired, e.g. 2 S 15:4
 who
maketh me judge? i.e. O that I were made judge! 1 S 20:10, 2 S 23:15. On the other
hand, ??? with the perfect (Gn 21:7, Nu 23:10, 1 S 26:9, Is 53:1, &c.) or participle (Ps
59:8, Pr 24:22, &c.), rather expresses a rhetorical question, i.e. a denial, cf. § 150 d.
Especially frequent is the use of ?????????? (prop. who gives?) to introduce all kinds of
desiderative clauses (see under b).—In Mal 1:10 the desiderative clause proper is co-
ordinated with an interrogative clause,
among you and would shut the doors, i.e. O that one would shut the doors!

 would that one were

??????? ????????? ???
?

????? ???
?

?? ?????????

?????? ?

????

Rem. Sometimes the original sense of ?????????? is still plainly discernible, e.g. Ju 9:29  ??????????

??????? ????? ????????? who gives this people into my hand? equivalent to, O that this people were
given into my hand! cf. Ps 55:7. In these examples, however, ?????????? is still equivalent to O
had I! and in numerous other instances the idea of giving has entirely disappeared, ??????????
having become stereotyped as a more desiderative particle (utinam). Its construction is
either—

(a) With the accusative (in accordance with its original meaning) of a substantive, Dt
28:67 would that it were even! … morning! Ju 9:29, Ps 14:7 (537), 55:7; with an accusative
and a following infinitive, Jb 11:5; with two accusatives, Nu 11:29, Jer 8:23; with the
accusative of an infinitive, Ex 16:3, 2 S 19:1
????
thee (for ????? cf. § 135 f); of a participle, Jb 31:35; of a personal pronoun (as a suffix), Jb 29:2

 would that I had died for

?????? ????? ????? ??????????

2 2 Cf. the analogous sentences after
? ???? 1 S 26:23; after ??? Is 12:1; likewise after ??? § 153 at the end; after ???? Dt 8:12–14,
25:3, Jos 6:18, 2 S 12:28.
3 3 The transition from a question to a wish may be seen, e.g. in Nu 11:4 who shall
give us flesh to eat? i.e. O that we had flesh to eat!

 because, Is 65:12, Jer 35:17; after causal

??(cid:31)???

????

???????????

 Is 27:4 and Jer 9:1 with a following accusative is not simply

(with a following ??; but
equivalent to ??? ??????????, but is properly who endows me with, &c.; cf. § 117 ff).—With a still
greater weakening of the original meaning ?????????? is used with an adjective in Jb 14:4 could a
clean thing but come out of an unclean! i.e. how can a clean thing come, &c.; similarly in Jb
31:31 who can find one that hath not been satisfied!

(b) With a following perfect, Jb 23:3 (cf. § 120 e); with a perfect consecutive, Dt 5:26 O

that they had such an heart!

(c) With a following imperfect, Jb 6:8, 13:5, 14:13; in Jb 19:23 the imperfect is twice

added with W?w (cf. a above, on Mal. 1:10).

On the cohortative in the apodosis to such desiderative clauses, cf. § 108 f.

2. The wish may also be expressed by the particles ??? (Ps 81:9, 95:7, 139:19, Pr
24:11, 1 Ch 4:10; always with a following imperfect) and ?? (for which in Ps 119:5 we
have ??????, 2 K 5:3 ???????, from ?? ah! and ???=??; both with a following imperfect)si, o
si! utinam.1 ?? is followed by the imperfect, Gn 17:18, Jb 6:2; by the jussive, Gn 30:34
(rather concessive, equivalent to let it be so); by the perfect, as the expression of a
wish that something might have happened in past time (cf. § 106 p), Nu 14:2
would that we had died; 20:3 and Jos 7:7 (both times ????); on the other hand, Is 48:18
and 63:19 (both times ???) to express a wish that something expected in the future
may already have happened.—On ?? with the imperative (by an anacoluthon) Gn
23:13 cf. § 110 e. On the perfect after ??? ??? Gn 40:14, 2 K 5:20, cf. § 106 n, note 2.

§ 152. Negative Sentences.

1. Besides the use of rhetorical questions (§§ 150 d, 151 a), independent sentences

are made negative by the adverbs ??? (Jb 6:21, where instead of the Keth. ?? we must
evidently read ???; perhaps preserved as a substantive) = the Greek ??, not, ??? = µ?
(Jb 24:25 as a substantive), ???? (it is) not;
??????  not, ?????? (cf. § 90 m) not.
The forms ???,  ?????
, ??????? not belong almost entirely to poetry.—With regard to ??? and
???? the main distinction is that verbal-clauses (rarely noun-clauses, see e) are regularly
negatived by ??? (besides its use as negativing single words1), while ???? is used
exclusively with noun-clauses (see the examples below).

??????  not yet,

1 1 Cf. a similar transition from a conditional to a desiderative particle, in
consequence of the suppression of the apodosis, in the English, O if I had! and the
like; e.g. Nu 22:29 if there were (???? ??) a sword in my hand now had I surely killed
thee!
1 1 Especially in compounds, e.g. ??????? lit. a no-God (Germ. Ungott)who is indeed
called a god, but is not really a god, Dt 32:21; ?????? ??? verse 17, cf. Jer 5:7, 2 Ch 13:9;
??????? lit. a not-people (Germ. Unvolk), Dt 32:21; ????? ??? a nothing, Am 6:13; ??? ???
lit. not-wood, Is 10:15; ????????, ????????? lit. not-man, superhuman (of God), Is 31:8;
(cid:31)???
?????????? not-violence, 16:17; after ?? Jb 26:2 f. (????????, ??????? helplessness, ??????? ???
insipientia); cf. also Is 55:2 ????? ???? ????? for what is unsatisfying; Ps 44:13, Jb 8:11,
15:32, 1 Ch 12:33.—In Nu 20:5 a construct state with several genitives is negatived
by ???.—Also ??? is used with an infinitive, Nu 35:23; with an adjective, ????? ???

 unrighteousness, Jer 22:13, cf. Ez 22:29; ???????????? disorder, Jb 10:22;

??????

The conjunctions ???? and ????????? that not, serve to negative dependent clauses. The

particular uses of these particles are as follows:—

(a) ??? (less frequently ???), like ??, ???, is used regularly for the objective,

????? ??? ????? ?????

unconditional negation, and hence is usually connected with the perfect or imperfect (as
indicative); on ??? with the imperfect to express an unconditional prohibition, see § 107 o; on
its use with the jussive, see § 109 d.—On ??? for
?????  nonne, in interrogative sentences, cf. §
150 a. In connexion with ???, ???? (= any), ??? is used to express an absolute negation, nullus,
, e.g.
none whatever (cf. the French ne … personne, ne … rien), usually in the order
Gn 3:1
 ye shall not eat of any tree of the garden; 9:11, Ex 10:15, 20:10,
Lv 7:23, Dt 8:9, Jer 13:7, 32:17 (
form of a rhetorical question, Jer 32:27); Pr 12:21, 30:30
 and turneth not away
for any; 2 Ch 32:15; but cf. also the inverted order, Ex 12:16 ? ??????????? ???????????? no manner of
work shall be done; 12:43, 15:26, 22:21, Lv 16:17, Jb 33:13, Dn 11:37. The meaning is
different when ??? by being determinate is used in the sense of whole, e.g. Nu 23:13  ??? ????
??????? thou shalt not see them all, but only a part.

 nothing at all; cf. the same statement in the
.

Analogous to

 ???

 is the use of

???

 ...

 ????

 Gn 23:6, &c., in verbal-clauses in the sense

of no one at all, not a single one. On ???????? nothing at all, see under p.

Rem. 1. The examples in which ??? is used absolutely as a negative answer, equivalent to

certainly not! no! must be regarded as extremely short verbal-clauses, e.g. Gn 19:2 (???
according to the context for
???
following ??? but, Gn 19:2 (see above); Jos 5:14, 1 K 3:22.

 &c.); 23:11, 42:10, Hag 2:12, Jb 23:6, sometimes with a

?? ???

2. The negation of noun-clauses by ??? (as opposed to the regular negationd by ????)

always includes a certain emphasis, since the force of the negation falls rather upon a
???????????? ???
?????
particular word (cf. e.g. Ez 36:32), than upon the whole clause. In 2 S 3:34
hands were not bound, a participle is thus specially negatived by ???; cf. Ps 74:9, where,
however, ??? is separated from the participle by
with a pronominal subject are thus negatived by ???, Gn 20:12, Nu 35:23 (Dt 4:42, 19:4); 1 S
15:29, 2 S 21:2, Jer 4:22, Ps 22:7, Jb 28:14, parallel with ????; generally with ??? before a
substantival predicate, e.g. Ex 4:10
Noun-clauses with a substantival subject, Gn 29:7, Nu 23:19, Is 22:2, 44:19, Hag 1:2, Ps 22:3,
Jb 9:32, 18:17, 21:9, 22:16, 36:26 (with ?? of the apodosis); 41:2; in Jb 9:33 even ??? ??? non est
is used instead of ????.—In Pr 18:5 ??? is used before an adjectival predicate; in 1 S 20:26
(where a preceding noun-clause is negatived by ???????) read ????? ??? with the LXX, for  ???
?????. On ??? for  ????  in circumstantial clauses to express attributive ideas, see u below.

 I am not a man of words; Am 5:18.—

, and Jb 12:3. As a rule, noun-clauses

??? ???????? ???? ???

???????

 thy

????

3. As a rule ??? stands immediately before the verb, but sometimes is separated from it
(frequently to bring into special prominence another word which follows it); thus Jb 22:7, Ec
10:10 before the object and verb; Nu 16:29 before the subject and verb; Dt 8:9, 2 S 3:34, Ps

unwise, Dt 32:6, Ho 13:13; ??????????? impius, Ps 43:1; ??????? and ?????????? not strong, Pr
30:25 f.; ??????? unsuitably, 2 K 7:9; ??????? not-good, Is 65:2, Ez 20:25, &c.; ????? ???
not-clean, 2 Ch 30:17; with a participle, e.g. Jer 2:2 (unsown); (68, Ez 4:14, 22:24, Zn
2:1, 3:5; the Masora, however, requires
 in
????(cid:31)???
Jer 6:8,
comforted, &c., and consequently not compounds, but either relative clauses or (Is
54:11, Ho 1:6, and especially 2:25) main clauses instead of proper names.—On the
above compounds generally, cf. the dissertation mentioned in § 81 d, note 2; on their
use in sentences expressing a state, to convey attributive ideas, see u below.

 in Ho 1:6, i.e. always 3rd sing. fem. perf. in pause = she was not

 in Is 54:11,

 in 62:12,

???????(cid:31)???

????(cid:31)???

????(cid:31)???

49:18, 103:10, Jb 13:16, 34:23 before a complementary adjunct. In Dt 32:5 ??? according to
the accentuation even stands at the end of the clause (they offend him not); but undoubtedly
?????? ??? are to be taken together.—On the position of ??? with the infinitive absolute, see § 113
v.

(b) ??? is used like µ? and ne to express a subjective and conditional negation, and hence
especially in connexion with the jussive (§ 109 c and e) to introduce prohibitions, warnings,
negative desires, and requests. On ??? with the imperfect, see § 107 p; with the cohortative,
see § 108 c; on 2 K 6:27, see § 109 h.

Rem. 1. ??? (like ???, see note on a above) maybe used to form a compound word, as in Pr
12:28 ???????? not-death (immortality); though all the early versions read ?????????. The instances
in which ?? appears to stand absolutely, equivalent to no, certainly not (like µ? for µ?
???????), e.g. Ru 1:13
(see under c) to extreme shortening of a full clause (in 2 S 13:25 such a clause is repeated
immediately afterwards); thus in 2 S 1:21, Is 62:2, Ps 83:2 ????? is evidently to be supplied, and
in Jo 2:13, Am 5:14, Pr 8:10 the corresponding jussive from the preceding imperatives, in Pr
17:12 from the preceding infinitive absolute.

 nay, my daughters, and Gn 19:18, 33:10 (??????), are also due

??? ??

????

2. ???, like ???, regularly stands immediately before the verb, but in Is 64:8, Jer 10:24,

15:15, Ps 6:2, 38:2 before another strongly emphasized member of the sentence.1

(c) ???? construct state (unless it be sometimes merely a contracted connective form, cf.

?? ??????

 § 97 d) of  ?????

 non-existence (as also the absolute state, see below) is the
???? ?? for
negative of ??? existence; cf. e.g. Gn 31:29 with Neh 5:5. As ??? (he, she, it is, was, &c.)
includes the idea of being in all tenses, so  ?????
Hence—

, ???? includes the idea of not being in all tenses.

(1) The absolute state  ?????

, with an evident transition to the meaning of a verbal predicate,

there does not exist, always follows the word negatived, e.g. Is 37:3 (2 K 19:3)
and strength does not exist to bring forth; Gn 2:5  ?????
not? after ????? is he …? (cf. Nu 13:20); Lv 26:37, Nu 20:5, Ju 4:20 (????? no). In 1 S 9:4 and
10:14  ?????
25:14, Jb 3:9  ???????
not so, Gn 30:1, Ex 32:32, Ju 9:15, 2 K 2:10.—Quite anomalous is  ?????
perfect as an emphatic negation; the text, however, can hardly be correct.

 is used in reference to a plural; 1 K 18:10, Is 41:17, 45:21, 59:11, Mi 7:2, Pr 13:4,
 if it be
 and let there be none, let none come! Ec 3:19.—Cf. finally  ?????

????
 Jb 35:15 before a

 was not present; Ex 17:7 ????????? or is he

??????? ???
? ??????
?

(2) The construct state ???? stands in its natural position immediately before the substantive

?????? ?????? ?????? ??????

whose non-existence it predicates, or before the subject of the sentence which is to be
negatived. To the former class belong also the very numerous instances in which ???? is joined
to a participle, e.g. 1 S 26:12
 and there was not one seeing, &c., i.e.
and no man saw it, nor knew it, neither did any awake; so especially ?????? with a participle in
subordinate circumstantial or descriptive clauses, such as Is 5:29
 and he shall
carry it away, while there is none delivering, i.e. without any one’s delivering it; Ps 7:3, &c.;
Lv 26:6 &c., ????????? ?????? without any one’s making you afraid; cf. § 141 e. ???? is used as the
negation of an entire noun-clause, e.g. in Gn 39:23, Nu 14:42 ??????????? ??????? ???? the Lord is not
among you; Gn 37:29 ????? ??????????? Joseph was not in the pit.

???? ?????? ??????????

 ????? ??????

??

1 1 In Jer 51:3 the pointing ???? occurs twice instead of ???, and is thus, in the opinion
of the Masoretes, equivalent to against him that bendeth; but undoubtedly we should
read ???.

(3) When the subject which is to be negatived is a personal pronoun, it is joined as a

suffix to ????, according to § 100 o, e.g.
thou art not, &c.;
????????
was) no longer alive; ?????? they are not, &c. When the accompanying predicate is a verb, it
follows again (see l) in the form of a participle, since ???? always introduces a noun-clause, e.g.
Ex 5:10

 I am not, was not, shall not be; ????????, fem. ???????,
 he, she is not, &c.; also absolutely, Gn 42:13 he is (524 he

 I will not give; 8:17, Dt 1:32.

?????(cid:31)? ???

, fem.

?????????

?????????

????

Rem. In Neh 4:17 ????? ???? for

?????????

 is due to its being co-ordinate with three other

(substantival) subjects; these are again expressly summed up in ??????????????.—In Hag 2:17  ????
??????? the pronominal complement of ???? appears to follow with the sign of the accusative;1 but
? ???????
most probably we should read with the LXX

 for ???????.

(4) The fact that ???? (like  ?????

) always includes the idea of a verb (is not, was not, &c.) led

finally to such a predominance of the verbal element, that the original character of ???? as a
construct state (but cf. i above) was forgotten, and accordingly it is very frequently separated
from its noun (substantive or participle); especially so by the insertion of shorter words (of the

12:30; but cf. also Ps 5:10, 6:6, 32:2, and ???? used absolutely in Ex 22:2, 1 K 8:9, Ru 4:4.—
Hence, finally, even the transposition of ???? and its noun became possible, e.g. Gn 40:8 and
41:15 ???? ???? ?????? and an interpreter there is not of it; Gn 47:13, Ju 14:6, 1 S 21:2, Is 1:30,
Jer 30:13, Hb 2:19, Pr 5:17 (??????=neve sint; cf. k above, on Jb 3:9); 30:27.—In Gn 19:31, Ex
5:16 ???? is placed between the subject and predicate.

????? ??? ????  a morning when there are not clouds, i.e. a cloudless

negative attributes by means of ???, ????? not (both so used almost exclusively in poetic
language) or ???? with a following substantive, mostly in the simplest form of circumstantial
clause; e.g. 2 S 23:4
morning; cf. Jb 12:24, 262 b, 38:26 (???????? where no man is, i.e. uninhabited); 1 Ch 2:30, 32
?????? ?  childless; so also ????? e.g. Jb 24:10 and ???? e.g. Ps 88:5 I am as a man ??????????? there is
not help, i.e. like a helpless man; Is 9:6 ????????? endless; 47:1, Ho 7:11; ????????????? countless, Ct
6:8, &c., but usually (Ps 104:25, &c.) like a proper circumstantial clause (cf. § 141 e)
connected by W?w, ???????????????.—Less frequently such periphrases take the form of relative
clauses (cf. § 155 e), e.g. Jb 30:13
helpless (but probably ????? is only an intrusion from 29:12, and we should read ????? without
any one’s restraining them; in 29:12 translate the fatherless and him that had none to help
him; in Ps 72:12 ?????????? is used in the same sense); Hb 1:14; with ???? Is 45:9 thy work is that
of a man who hath no hands; Zc 9:11 out of the waterless pit.1

How far such compounds finally came to be regarded by the language simply as negative
adjectives, may be seen partly from the fact that they (as also relative clauses analogous to the
above) are frequently co-ordinated with real adjectives, Jo 1:6, Ps 72:12, Jb 29:12; cf. also Is
59:10, where
of the dative ??, e.g. Is 40:29 (= and to the powerless); Jb 262 a.3, Neh 8:10.

(i) ???? lest, that not, at the beginning of a clause expressing a fear or precaution, hence
especially after such ideas as fearing, Gn 32:12, &c. (cf. ????? µ?, vereor ne), taking heed,
frequently after
infrequently the idea on which ???? depends, is only virtually contained in the main clause, e.g.
 lest some evil
Gn 19:19 I cannot escape to the mountain (because I am afraid),
overtake me; Gn 26:9, 38:11; also in Gn 44:34 from the rhetorical question how shall I … ?
we must understand I cannot, governing ???. This is especially the case after an appeal to do or
not to do an action by which something may be prevented (in which case ???? is simply
equivalent to the final ne); cf. e.g. Gn 11:4, 19:15, Nu 20:18 (where ???? lest is separated from
the verb by a strongly emphasized substantive); Ju 15:12 after swear unto me; Pr 24:18.—In
Gn 3:22 and now, lest he put forth his hand, &c., ???? is to be regarded as virtually dependent
on a cohortative, which immediately afterwards (verse 23) is changed into an historic tense;
cf. also Gn 26:7, 31:31, 42:4 Ex 13:17, 1 S 13:19, 27:11, Ps 38:17, in every case after  ???

1 1 In Pr 9:13 (perhaps also 14:7; but see Delitzsch on the passage) a verbal-clause is

2. Two negatives in the same sentence do not neutralize each other (as in nonnulli,
non nemo), but make the negation the more emphatic (like ??? ??????, ??? ????µ??,
nulli—non, nemo non); e.g. Zp 2:2 (if the text is correct)
shall (not) come.1 This especially applies to the compounds formed by the union of ????
or ????? with ???? without (§ 119 y), e.g. Is 5:9 (611) ? ???? ?????? (for which in Jer 2:15  ???????
? ???), prop. without no inhabitant, i.e. so that no inhabitant is left there. On the other
 the ???? is causative, because there is no water; as also in Ex
hand, in Is 50:2
14:11 ????? ????????? is it because there were no …? 2 K 1:3, 6, 16. In Ec 3:11

3. The negative sometimes extends its influence from the first to a second negative

sentence parallel with it (which may or may not have W?w) ; e.g. 1 S 2:3 talk not so
much arrogancy; let (not) boasting come out of your mouth; Ex 28:43, Lv 19:12, 22:9,
15 f., Nu 16:14, 23:19, Dt 7:25, Is 23:4, 28:27, 38:18, 47:14, Ez 16:47, Ps 9:19, 13:5,
35:19, 38:2, 44:19, 75:6, Jb 28:17 (so
??? ???  why … not? in Jb 3:11 also affects the
parallel clause).

???

§ 153. Restrictive and Intensive Clauses.

The particles ???, ??? only, serve to introduce restrictive clauses, and ???, ?? also,
besides, even, intensive clauses. It is to be observed that the force of these particles
does not necessarily affect the word which immediately follows (as is the case with ???
Gn 7:23, 34:15; ??? Gn 6:5, Am 3:2; even ??? ????? hath he indeed only? Nu 12:2; ??? Gn
27:34, Jb 7:11; ?? Dt 15:17), but very frequently extends to the whole of the
following sentence. Thus with ???, e.g. Nu 14:9, 1 K 17:13, Pr 17:11, Jb 13:15, 14:22,
16:7, 23:6; ??? Gn 20:11, 24:8, Ps 32:6, Pr 13:10; ??? Gn 27:33, 32:21 (????? ???), 44:10; 1
S 22:7, 28:20, Zc 9:11, Pr 17:26, 20:11; ?? Jb 14:3, 15:4.—In Mal 1:10 and Jb 2:10 ???
is placed before two co-ordinate sentences, although, strictly speaking, it applies only
to the second. Cf. the analogous examples in § 150 m.

§ 154. Sentences connected by W?w.

W?w copulativum1 (??) serves to connect two or more sentences, or single words
(on its various vocalization, cf. § 104 d–g). Its use, however, is by no means restricted

1 1 In 1 K 10:21
LXX and Lucian, to

???????(cid:31)???

 goes with what precedes and must be emended, with the

1 For further particulars of the use of w?w copulativum, see Gesenius’ Thesaurus,

i. 393 ff. On its use in the co-ordination of similar tenses and moods (e.g. five

imperfects consecutive in Gn 25:34, five perfects with ?????) as well as of dissimilar
tenses and moods, the remarks made in the treatment of the tenses will suffice. With
regard to the connexion of single nouns by ?? (which strictly speaking is always really
a contraction of so many clauses into a single sentence) the following observations
may be made:—

(a) Contrary to English usage, which in lengthy enumerations uses the and to
connect only the last member of the series, in Hebrew polysyndeton is customary, as
in Gn 12:16 w?w copulativum six times, 24:35 seven times, 15:19 ff. nine times, and
in Jos 7:24 ten times. Sometimes, however, only the last two words are joined (so in a
series of three members, Gn 5:32, 10:1, 11:26, 13:2, 14:1, 30:39, &c.; the last three
out of a series of four, Jer 2:26); less frequently only the first two, Ps 45:9; cf. § 132
d. The formula ????? ?? ????? yesterday (and) the day before yesterday, Ex 5:8, &c., is
always without the copula. On the other hand, the constructio asyndetos in a series of
verbs is used as a rhetorical expedient to produce a hurried and so an impassioned
description; e.g. Ju 5:27 at her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay; Ex 15:9, Dt 32:15, 1 S
15:6, Jer 4:7, Am 5:21, Ps 10:10, 14:1, 45:5, Jb 20:19, 28:4, 29:8, Ct 2:11, 5:6, &c.

(b) Frequently w?w copulativum is also explanatory (like isque, et—quidem, and
the German und zwar, English to wit), and is then called w?w explicativum, e.g. Gn
4:4 and (i.e. namely) of the fat thereof (unless it is simply copulative); Ex 24:12, 25:12
(to wit two); 27:14, 28:23, Ju 17:3 (in ????????; here as often elsewhere, to introduce an
explanatory gloss, cf. Is 17:8, Ez 3:15, and especially P. Haupt, SBOT. Isaiah, p. 90, l.
21 ff.), 1 S 17:34 and that too with the bear; 2 S 13:20, Is 57:11, Jer 17:10, Am 3:11,
4:10, Ze 9:9, Pr 3:12, Neh 8:13, 2 Ch 23:10 (but in 1 S 28:3 the ? before ??????? is to be
omitted with the LXX); cf. also such combinations as ?????—??? from … and even to …,
Gn 13:3, 14:23, 19:4, 11, &c.—In 1 S 6:11 (see Driver on the passage), 2 S 1:23, &c.,
? is equivalent to yea, and; in Is 32:7 even.

?? is used to express emphasis (=and especially), e.g. in Gn 3:16 ???????????; Is 2:1, Ps

18:1, perhaps also in Jb 10:17 yea, a whole host; 2 Ch 16:14.—An undoubted
example of what is called w?w concomitantiae occurs in Jb 41:12 a seething pot ????????
with burning rushes; cf. Ex 10:10 (with your little ones), 12:8, Lv 1:12, Is 42:5. In
Arabic this w?w concom. is followed by the accusative.

??-??

 is used in the sense of both—and in Ps 76:7, Dn 1:3, 8:13. On  ??-??

 as meaning

sive—sive, cf. § 162 b.

??

?? ??????

 both together, Gn 27:45, Pr 17:15;

(c) See the Lexicon on adverbs used in a copulative sense, such as ??? also,
moreover, summing up a number, e.g.
(cid:31)???
?????  all together; as an intensive and, e.g. Gn 30:8, 37:7, 1 S 30:8; cf. also such
examples as 1 S 24:12 see, yea see!
 or
three times in Gn 24:25 and 32:20; also ??, which is generally still more intensive, in
the sense of also, in addition to this, even, and belongs rather to poetry, and to the
later language; frequently also equivalent to a mere and, but sometimes adversative
but now, Ps 44:10, &c.; and
 (also three times), equivalent to both—and; cf.  ????
??? and even, Lv 26:44; ?????? prop. add to this also that, equivalent to not to mention,
according to the context either quanto magis or quanto minus.

 Gn 24:44=both—and; ??? occurs

merely to joining sentences which are actually co-ordinate. Frequently the language
employs merely the simple connexion by W?w, even to introduce an antithesis (Gn
17:21, 19:19, Lv 2:12, Jb 6:25, and very frequently in circumstantial noun-clauses), or
when one of the two clauses is not co-ordinated, but subordinated to the other. On the
use of ?? to introduce circumstantial clauses, cf. especially § 141 e and § 142 d;
introducing causal clauses, § 158 a; comparative clauses, § 161 a; final clauses, § 165
a; consecutive clauses, § 166 a. On w?w apodosis, cf. § 143 d, and the sections there
cited; on the use of W?w in numerical sayings, cf. § 134 s.

Rem. Sometimes w?w copulativum joins a sentence apparently to what immediately
precedes, but in reality to a sentence which is suppressed and which must, therefore, be
supplied from the context. So especially ?? with imperatives to express inferences, e.g. 1 K
2:22 ?????? ???? ask now rather; Ez 18:32 for I have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth …,
??? ?????? wherefore turn yourselves. Also at the beginning of a speech in loose connexion with
an act or speech of another person, e.g. Ex 2:20, 2 S 18:11, 24:3, 2 K 4:14, 41, 7:13, 2 Ch
25:9; cf. also Jos 7:7 (????), Ps 2:10, 4:4, Is 8:7. Sometimes the suppression of the protasis is
due to passionate excitement or haste, which does not allow time for full expression; this is
especially illustrated by Nu 12:14, 20:3 (????), 1 S 10:12, 15:14, 22:14, 28:16, 2 S 18:12, 24:3,
1 K 2:22 (
circumstantial clause whereas I=and yet I have, &c.); cf. also a new clause beginning with the
formula of wishing ???? Nu 11:29, Ju 9:29; on the disconnected use of ????? and ????? cf. § 159 dd.

§ 155. Relative Clauses.

See V. Baumann, Hebräische Relatîvsätze, Leipzig, 1894 (cf. the heading of § 138
above); G. Bergsträsser, ‘Das hebr. Präfix ?, ’ ZATW 1909, p. 40 ff.1

1. By § 138 a, e, relative clauses are divided into two classes: those which are
used for the nearer definition of a noun (substantive or pronoun), and those which are
not dependent on a noun. The former may be called incomplete, the latter complete
relative clauses.

Complete relative clauses, as a rule (see the exceptions under n), are introduced by

the originally demonstrative pronoun ? ????; see further in § 138 e. Similarly,
incomplete relative clauses may also be introduced by ? ????, or by some other
demonstrative pronoun; see further in § 138 a and g–k. Very frequently, however,
especially in poetic style, the attributive relation is expressed by simple co-
ordination.1

1 1 In this exhaustive article the author shows that between ? (on the pronunciation
see § 36) and ? ???? there is syntactically no primary difference, but only a secondary
distinction which arose in the course of the development of the language, namely that
? ???? is preferred in combinations which are customary in the old literary language, and
? in those which are derived from the popular language or from Aramaic.
1 1 The old view that all these cases arise from the omission of ? ???? is incorrect. These
co-ordinated attributive clauses are rather a mere subdivision of the various kinds of
circumstantial clauses (see § 156) which may be attached to a nomen regens. Cf. in
English this is the letter (which) he wrote to me.

The governing substantive or pronoun is frequently (in certain cases always)
resumed by a pronominal suffix or an adverb. The resumption may, however, be
omitted, just as in relative clauses introduced by ? ????, &c.; see § 138 f.

In Arabic a distinction is made between relative clauses used for the nearer definition of a

determinate substantive (?ila), and those which are attached to an indeterminate substantive
(?ifa). The former must be introduced by the demonstrative pronoun alla???, the latter are
always simply co-ordinated. The same distinction was no doubt originally observed in
Hebrew, since simply co-ordinated relative clauses are most commonly found after
indeterminate substantives (see the examples below), and in cases like Dt 28:49 ( ? ???? ???
?????? ??? ????????? a nation whose tongue thou shalt not understand; cf. Is 66:13, and especially 1
S 3:11), the addition of ? ???? is explained from the special stress laid on the indeterminate
substantive,2 a nation of such a kind, thou understandest not their tongue. On the other hand,
in poetic style at least, ? ???? is somewhat frequently omitted even after a determinate noun, but
only rarely in prose (except by the Chronicler; cf. 1 Ch 9:22, 12:23, 29:1 (read prob. ? ???? for
?????), 2 Ch 15:11; after ???? 1 Ch 29:3, 2 Ch 18:23, 30:17, 31:19, Ezr 1:5, but also Gn 39:4; for
further instances, see Driver, Introd.8, p. 537, no. 30); so Ex 18:20, Ju 8:1, 20:15, 1 K 13:12
(=which way), so 2 K 3:8, 2 Ch 18:23; Neh 13:23; after a pronominal subject, 1 S 6:9. In Jer
52:12 for ????? read ????? with the LXX.

2. If the nearer definition of a substantive or pronoun is effected by simple co-

ordination of the relative clause, it may take the form—

(a) Of a noun-clause, e.g. 2 S 20:21 a man of the hill country of Ephraim

?? ?? ???
???
 that had gold; Ps
whose name was Sheba; Zc 6:12, Jb 1:1, 3:15 with princes
11:4, Pr 22:11; when referring to a noun-suffix, e.g. Ps 49:14
 this is
the way of them who have (self-)confidence.—On periphrases of this kind to express
negative attributes, as in Jb 38:26
?? ???
152 u, and cf. for this very short form of the relative clause, Gn 15:13
 in
a land that belongs not to them; Dt 32:17 (?????? ??? ?????????); Hb 1:6, Pr 26:17 (??????).

(b) Of a verbal clause.

Here we must distinguish the cases in which the retrospective pronoun—

?????

??? ?????

 the night which said; after ???? Ps 71:18; referring to a vocative, which is

(1) Is the subject of the relative clause, and is contained in the verb; so after a
determinate substantive, Ps 34:9 happy is the man ??????????? that trusteth in him; Jb 33 b
??
determinate in itself even without the article, Is 54:1, or to a noun-suffix (see under e),
Ps 16:4; after an indeterminate substantive, e.g. Jb 31:12 it is a fire (that) devoureth
unto Abaddon; Dt 3217 b, 1 S 6:9, Is 55:13, 56:2, Ps 68:31, 78:6, Pr 30:17, La 1:10, 2
Ch 28:9; referring to the suffix in ??????? Is 28:16, prop. behold me, who have laid, &c.,
but perhaps the participle
participle ????? should be read instead of the imperfect); Ez 25:7. The relative clause is
used in this way especially to supply the place of an adjective, e.g. Gn 49:27
?????? ?????
a wolf that ravineth, i.e. a ravining wolf; Is 51:12; to express a negative quality, e.g. Is
40:20, Ho 4:14 ??????????? ??? an undiscerning people.

?????  is to be read; 29:14, 38:5 (but probably again the

particle of comparison ??  , e.g. Jb 7:2
?????
shadow, &c.; Dt 32:11, Is 62:1, Jer 23:29, Ho 6:3, Ps 42:2, 83:15, Jb 9:26, 11:16; so also after
???? Ps 58:5; after a determinate substantive, e.g. Is 53:7 (but the better reading is ? ???? without
the article), 61:10 f., Hb 2:14, Ps 49:13, 21, 125:1; see also the examples under h. Sometimes
it seems simpler in such cases, to take the verb directly as predicate to the preceding
substantive, and to explain ??   (for ? ???????; see Comparative Clauses, § 161 b) as a
conjunction—a view which even Hupfeld was ready to accept, at least as regards Ps 90:5,
125:1, Is 53:7, 61:11, but it can hardly be right.

(2) The cases in which the retrospective pronoun represents an accusative of the

object, or would do so if not suppressed, as it usually is in such cases in relative
clauses with ? ????, cf. §138 b. Examples with the retrospective pronoun are, Dt 32:17
??????? ??? ???????? gods whom they knew not (see also the end of the verse); after a
substantive with ??(see above, g), Jer 23:9, Jb 13:28. Without a retrospective pronoun,
after a determinate substantive, Ju 8:1, Ps 33:12 (preceded by a relative clause with
? ????); Jb 28:1. Other examples of this kind, though the article is omitted according to
poetic usage, are Is 15:7 (? ???? ???????, for which Jer 48:36 ? ???? ??????? with the substantive
in the construct state governing the relative clause, see § 130 d), Ps 7:16, 51:10, La
1:21.—Without the retrospective pronoun, after an indeterminate substantive, e.g. Is
6:6
the altar; Ex 15:17, Is 42:16 (4817, Ps 25:12, all after
Is 64:2; Ec 10:5 (in 6:1 the same clause with  ?????

(3) The cases in which the retrospective pronoun is dependent on a preposition, or

its place is taken by the adverb ? ??, as in Jer 2:6 end. Thus after a determinate
substantive, Ps 18:3 ??????????? ????? my rock in which I take refuge; Ex 18:20, Is 42:1; in
Jb 33 a also, the omission of the article with ??? is only a poetic licence. After an
indeterminate substantive, Jer 2:6, last clause but one; Ps 32:2.

In this case also the retrospective word is not infrequently suppressed, giving rise

to extremely short, bold expressions, such as Is 51:1 look unto the rock ?????????
(whence) ye were hewn, and to the hole of the pit ????????? (whence) ye were digged; Jb
21:27 the devices (where-with) ye act violently against me.—A retrospective adverb is
suppressed in Jb 38:19 where is the way (to the place where) the light dwelleth? cf.
38:24.

Rem. 1. The omission of the retrospective word occurs most frequently in relative clauses
which are governed by the construct state of a preceding substantive (especially an expression
of time) and hence are virtually in the genitive. In addition to the instances already given in §
130 d, cf. the following: after ????? Lv 7:35, Ps 56:10; after ????? Jer 36:2; after simple ??? Ps
56:4 (?????? ??? on the day when I am afraid); after ????? 2 Ch 29:27 (???????? ????? ????? at the time
when the burnt offering began); 20:22, 24:11, Jb 6:17; after ????? Dt 32:35; after
after ????? Ps 4:8 thou hast put gladness in my heart more than (their gladness) at the time
(when) their corn and their wine are increased.

?????  Mi 5:2;

??

2. The agreement (§ 138 d) of the retrospective pronoun with a pronominal regens in the

1st or 2nd person also takes place in a simple co-ordinated relative clause in 1 S 26:14 who
art thou (that) criest? Cf., however, Is 63:19 we are become as they over whom (??? not
????? )
thou no longer bearest rule.

3. Occasionally—chiefly in poetic or otherwise elevated style—even independent

relative clauses are simply co-ordinated with a regens, whereas we should expect
them always to be preceded by a demonstrative pronoun, on the analogy of the
examples in § 138 e. The suppressed pronoun would stand—

(a) As subject, Is 41:24 an abomination (is he) that chooseth you (but read

perhaps ???????); Jb 30:13, cf. § 152 u.

(b) As object, Is 41:2, with a retrospective pronoun; Mal 2:16 ??????? and him that
covereth (or read ????????); Jb 29:12 I delivered … the fatherless also, and him that had
none to help him.

(c) In the genitive governed by a substantive (cf. § 130 d), Ex 4:13  ??????? ??

???? ?????????? send, I pray thee, by the hand of him whom thou wilt send, i.e. by the hand
of some one else; Ps 65:5 and Pr 8:32, verbal-clauses after ??? ???? O the happiness of
the man, &c.; Ps 81:6, 141:9, Jb 29:16, La 1:14; after ???? Gn 39:4, but we must
certainly read here, with the Samaritan and LXX, ?????? ? ???????? as in verses 5 and 8;
Ex 9:4; verbal-clauses after  ????

 1 Ch 29:3, 2 Ch 30:19, 31:19, Ezr 1:5.

(d) Governed by a preposition; so verbal-clauses after ??????? Jer 2:8; after ???? (=to
the place where), 1 Ch 15:12, but Ex 23:20 before the same verb ? ???? ???????????; after ??
 by them
Jer 2:11, 2 Ch 1:4 (?????????=???????=to the place where); after ?? Is 65:1  ? ?? ?????
that asked not for me …
 them that sought me not; Ez 13:3 that which they
have not seen, but the text is hardly correct; after ??? Ps 119:136, cf. § 158 b; after ??? 2
Ch 16:9.—A noun-clause follows ?? in Neh 8:10. An analogous instance in Aramaic is
Ezr 5:14 to one whose name was Sheshbazzar [so in the papyri, see the Lexicon, p.
1116a].

§ 156. Circumstantial Clauses.

1. The statement of the particular circumstances under which a subject appears as
performing some action, or under which an action (or an occurrence) is accomplished,
is made especially (apart from relative clauses, see § 155) by means of noun-clauses
connected by W?w with a following subject (see further on this kind of circumstantial
clause in § 141 e), and by verbal-clauses (see § 142 d). Very frequently, however,
such statements of the particular circumstances are subordinated to the main clause by
being simply attached, without W?w, either as noun-clauses, sometimes extremely
short (see c), or as verbal-clauses (see d–g).

Rem. Among relative clauses of this kind the commonest are the various noun-clauses,
which are most closely subordinated to a preceding substantive without ? ????, e.g. Gn 16:12;
also statements of weight, Gn 24:22; of name, Jb 1:1 (also introduced by ?? ??? Gn 24:29, 1 S
1:1, &c., or ??? ??? Gn 16:1, 22:24, &c.); of a condition of body, Ju 1:7, and others.—Noun-
clauses which begin with w?w and the predicate have a somewhat more independent
character than those introduced by w?w and the subject1 (Gn 19:1, &c.). The former,
however, are also to be regarded as circumstantial clauses, in so far as they describe a state

1 1 In Dt 32:31 this form of sequence appears to be selected for another purpose, and
indeed our enemies are judges thereof, with w?w emphatic; to take it as a
circumstantial clause is too artificial.

which is simultaneous with the principal action; thus Is 3:7 I will not be an healer,  ???? ?????????
??????  while in my house is neither bread nor clothing; Is 6:6 (Am 7:7); 2 S 13:18, 16:1. Cf.
also the instances in § 152 l of ?????? followed by a participle, as ?????? ??????, &c.

2. Characteristic examples of circumstantial noun-clauses are Gn 12:8 and pitched

??? ?

????

?????

???? ??????? ????? ?????????
S 18:14 through the heart of Absalom,
 while he was yet alive; Jer 30:6, Ez 9:2
?
(cf. Ct 3:8), Na 3:8, Zc 14:5, 2 Ch 23:10; with the predicate preceding, e.g. 1 S 26:13,
Ps 32:8.—In Gn 41:29 a noun-clause serves to announce a state in the future.—We
may also include here certain set phrases, as ?????????? ?????? face to face (prop. while face
was turned towards face), Gn 32:31, Ex 33:11, Dt 34:10, &c.;1 so also to cast oneself
down,
??????  in 1 K 1:31, Is 49:23).2—Cf. finally the formula ?????????? ??? mother with children,
Gn 32:12; cf. Ho 10:14 and § 119 aa note 2.

 the face being turned to the earth, Gn 19:1, &c. (for ??????? we find

??????? ???

????

Rem. On circumlocutions of this kind to express negative attributes by means of short

noun-clauses (complete or incomplete), cf. § 152 u.

3. As circumstantial verbal-clauses,3 we find (1) sometimes affirmative clauses
(see below), but far more frequently (2) negative clauses (see f), and among these (3)
a certain number of expressions which may be regarded simply as equivalent to
negative adverbial ideas (see g).

Examples of (1) Is 511 b woe unto them, that tarry late in the evening,

???
inflames them; Is 1:5, 10:24, 30:31, Jer 7:26, 20:15, Ps 4:3, 5:12, 21:13, 62:5. The
circumstantial verbal-clause is used to particularize an action which has before been
expressed generally, in Gn 44:12, 48:14=crossing his hands; Dt 2:27, Ju 6:19; antithetically, 1
K 13:18 ?? ????? wherewith however he lied unto him. The verbal-clause seems to assign a
reason in Ps 7:7
103:5.4

 since thou hast commanded judgement; a consequence in Ps

?????????? ???  while wine

???? ??? ????

????

Rem. On the cases in which an imperfect in the sense of a final clause is subordinated to a

verb of motion (generally ???), see § 120 c.

Of (2), subordinate verbal-clauses with ??? (in English usually rendered by without and
the gerund, if the subject be the same as in the principal clause), e.g. Lv 1:17 ???????? ??? without
dividing it asunder; Jb 31:34; ??? with the perfect is so used in Gn 44:4, Ex 34:28, 1 S 30:2,

)??(cid:31)??? (

 is really to be regarded as a virtual predicate to

 as a casus instrumenti, is seen from Is 49:23, where

1 1 The expression ?????? ???????? to look one another in the face (i.e. to contend in
combat) 2 K 14:8, 11, 2 Ch 25:17, 21, is probably only a shortened form for  ????????
?????????? ??????.

3 3 Some examples of these have been already discussed in another connexion above,

harmonizing transposition; read

§ 157. Object-Clauses (Oratio Obliqua).

Clauses which depend on a transitive verb, especially on what are called verba
cordis, i.e. verbs denoting any mental act, such as to see, to hear, to know, to perceive,
to believe, to remember, to forget, to say, to think, &c., may be subordinated to the
governing verb without the help of a conjunction by simple juxtaposition (§ 120 a), or
they may be co-ordinated with it either with or without w?w copulative (§ 120 d–h).
As a rule, however, the objective clause is introduced by the conjunction ??? that, less
frequently by ? ???? that.1

Examples:—

(a) Object-clauses without a conjunction. Besides the passages mentioned in § 120

(especially under e) there are a number of examples, in which a clause depending on a verbum
dicendi or sentiendi (the oratio obliqua of the Latin and English Grammar) is added in the
 say, I
form of an independent noun-clause or verbal-clause; e. g. Gn 12:13
pray thee, thou art my sister; Ps 10:13, Jb 253a.14, Neh 6:6; Zc 8:23 (after ??? ??); Ps 9:21 (after
?????); verbal-clauses, e. g. Ps 50:21 thou thoughtest  ??? ??????????????
 I was surely like thyself [but
read ???? for ?????]; Gn 41:15, Ju 9:48 what ye have seen me do; Is 48:8, Ho 7:2.

???? ???????????
?

? ???

????

???

(b) Object-clauses introduced by ???, e. g. Gn 6:5 ??????? ????? ????? ??? ??????? ??????? and the Lord

saw that the wickedness of man was great, &c.—Direct narration also is very frequently
introduced by ??? (analogous to the ??? recitativum; frequently, indeed, with the secondary idea
of a particle of asseveration, as in Gn 26:9, 27:20), e. g. Gn 21:30, 22:16 f., 26:22, 29:32,
37:35, Jos 2:24, &c., even when the direct narration is not expressly indicated, Gn 4:25,
32:31, 41:51 f., Ex 18:4.—On the expression of a second object by means of a clause
introduced by ???, see § 117 h.2

1 1 On these clauses with ??? and ? ???? and generally on clauses which we should render
as subordinate, cf. P. Doörwald ‘Zur hebr. Syntax’ in Neue Jahrbb. für Philol. und
Pädag. 1890, p. 115 ff.
2 2 Instead of a complete objective clause we sometimes find a kind of accusative and
infinitive construction, especially after ????? (prop. to give up) in the sense of to allow,
e. g. Nu 21:23 ???????? ????? ????? ???????? ?????? ???????????? and Sihon did not suffer Israel to pass
through his border; 20:21; followed by an infinitive with ??, e. g. Gn 20:6, 31:7, Ex
3:19.—Cf. also the analogous examples in Dt 28:56 (after ????? to venture; see § 113 d);
Ju 11:20 (after????????? to trust); 1 K 19:4 (after ?? ?? to request).

(c) Object-clauses introduced by ? ????, e. g. Est 3:4 ??????? ????? ???? ????? ??????????? for he had
told them that he was a Jew; 1 S 18:15, Ez 20:26, Ec 8:12, 3 even before direct narration, 1 S
15:20, 2 S 1:4. Somewhat frequently ? ???? is preceded by the nota accusativi ???? (equivalent to
the circumstance, the fact, that), e. g. Jos 2:10, 1 S 24:11, 19, 2 S 11:20, Is 38:3, but in Gn
30:29, Dt 29:15 equivalent to the way in which.

§ 158. Causal Clauses.

A complete clause, assigning the reason for statements, demands, threats, &c.,
sometimes follows with the simple w?w copulative, e. g. Ps 60:13 give us help against
the adversary, and (for) vain is the help of man; Gn 6:17 (????????), 22:12, Ex 23:9, Jb
22:12, perhaps also Ps 7:10; or even without W?w, e. g. Gn 17:14. As a rule, however,
special conjunctions in various combinations are used to introduce causal clauses.

???

 Is 3:16, &c., and
???
 ???

The most common causal conjunctions are

? ???? ???  because, prop.
??????  Nu 20:12,

???
on account of the fact that; both, however, may also be shortened to the simple
&c., or to ??? because, Gn 3:14, 17, &c., or to ? ???? Gn 30:18, 31:49, 34:13, 27, 1 S 15:15,
20:42, 26:16, 23, 1 K 3:19, 8:33, Ho 14:4, Zc 1:15; also ? ??????? Gn 39:9, 23. On the other
??????  is sometimes repeated for emphasis,
hand, the simple
German sintemal und alldieweil) Lv 26:43, Ez 13:10 (without ? 36:3); also
and ???????1 Dt 31:17, Ju 3:12, Mal 2:14 on the ground that; ? ???? ????????? because of the
circumstance that, Dt 23:5; ? ???? ????????????? for this very cause that, Jer 3:8. But just as the
, so also the simple ???? with the perfect stands for ? ???????? Ps
???? ???
???
simple
119:136, Ezr 3:11; cf. ????????? Gn 31:20 and ??????? Dt 28:55 both with the perfect, equivalent to
because … not.—Cf. further
 ???
???
??? (2 S 12:10 with the perfect; Am 4:12 with the imperfect) prop. in return for the fact that;
similarly again the simple
imperfect; finally, ? ??????? Is 43:4 arising from the fact that,= because;
&c., and

??????  Nu 14:24 with the perfect, and Dt 7:12, 8:20 with the

? ???? ???  Gn 22:18, 26:5, 2 S 12:6, all with the perfect, and

??? ???  Dt 4:37, Pr 1:29 for the reason that.

 (something like the
???
????? ???

? ???? ???  1 S 26:21,

?
??????  is used for

? ??????  2 S 3:30,

????

???

???

??

???

Rem. 1. The preposition ???? (because of, on account of) with the infinitive (§ 114 e) is
frequently used as the equivalent of a full causal clause; cf. e. g. Am 1:3, 6, 13, 2:1, 6. Such a
construction with the infinitive may, however, according to § 114 r, be continued by means of
a finite verb, in which case ???? governs the verb as a conjunction; e. g. Am 1:9
??????? ????? because they delivered up … and remembered not, &c.; 1:11, 2:4; without W?w, Is
30:14.

 ??????????????

 ...

2. The choice of tenso is regulated by the general principles stated in § 106 ff., viz. the
perfect (cf. especially § 106 f) refers to causes already brought fully into effect, the imperfect
to those which may contingently arise; cf. e. g. Dt 7:12, 8:20, 1 K 8:33, where the imperfect
leaves the possibility still open that the persons addressed will perhaps escape the threatened
punishments by avoiding disobedience.—Cf. further, § 111 h on the imperfect consecutive,
and § 112 nn on the perfect consecutive in the apodosis to causal clauses.

§ 159. Conditional Sentences.

3 3 In Jer 28:9 a subject-clause is thus introduced by ? ???? instead of the usual ???.
1 1 Also ???????????? prop. for therefore, Gn 18:5, 19:8, 33:10, 38:26, Nu 10:31, 14:43, 2
S 18:20 Qerê, and ??????? ? ???? Jb 34:27, always mean for as much as.

Cf. H. Ferguson, ‘The Use of the Tenses in Conditional Sentences in Hebrew’ (Journal of
the Society of Bibl. Lit. and Exeg., Middletown, Conn., June and September, 1882).—P.
Friedrich, Die hebr. Conditionalsätze, Königsberg, 1884 (Inaug.-Diss.).—Driver, Use of
the Tenses, 3rd ed., p. 174 ff.

1. The great variety of construction in conditional sentences is owing to the fact

that it frequently depends on the subjective judgement of the speaker, whether he
wishes a condition to be regarded as capable of fulfilment (absolutely, or at least
possibly), thus including those already fulfilled, or as incapable of fulfilment. On this
distinction depends the choice both of the conditional particle to be used (see below),
and especially (as also in Greek and Latin) of the tense. The use of the latter is
naturally determined according to the general principles laid down in § 106 ff.1 In the
following sketch, for the sake of clearness, conditional sentences without conditional
particles will be first discussed (under b), and afterwards sentences with these
particles (under l).

2. The relation between condition and consequence may be expressed, as in
English, by the simple juxtaposition of two clauses. At the same time, it is to be
observed in general as a fundamental rule (in accordance with the original character
of the two tenses), that the imperfect, with its equivalents (the jussive, cohortative,
imperative, perfect consecutive, and participle), is used to express a condition and
consequence which are regarded as being capable of fulfilment in present or future
time, while the perfect represents a condition already fulfilled in the past, and its
consequence as an accomplished fact. The other use of the perfect—to represent
conditions regarded as impossible—occurs only in connexion with particles.

Examples:—

2  ?????
(a) Imperfect (cf. § 107 x) in protasis and apodosis, Jos 22:18, Ps 104:28 ff.  ???????
????? (if) thou givest unto them, they gather, &c.; Ps 139:18, Pr 12:17, Jb 20:24, Ec 1:18, Neh
1:8; with an interrogative imperfect in the apodosis, Ju 13:12; with the jussive, Jb 10:16; with
the cohortative, Pr. 1:23; with the perfect, Is 26:10 (yet will he not learn righteousness; the
apodosis forcibly denies what the imperfect in the protasis had represented as still
conceivable; cf. Ho 8:12); with the perfect consecutive, Gn 47:25, Ex 33:5; with the protasis
suppressed, Jb 5:8 (see § 107 x).

???

(b) Jussive in protasis (cf. § 109 h, i) and apodosis, Ps 104:10

 (if) thou
makest darkness, it is night; imperfect in the apodosis, Ps 10429 b; cohortative Pr 1:23. Also in
Ex 7:9 ???????? ????? it shall become a serpent, is the apodosis to a suppressed protasis if thou cast
it down; so in 2 K 5:10 ??????? is the apodosis to a protasis if thou wash, contained in what
precedes.

??? ?????
?

?? ?????? ?? ??

??????

1 1 It may, moreover, happen that a different idea is introduced in the apodosis, from
that with which the protasis started—a source of many further variations.
2 2 On the termination  -??  cf. § 47 m. In verse 28 b also ????? ???? is probably to be
explained from its immediately preceding the greater pause. These terminations in
verses 28–30 and Ps 139:18 can scarcely have any connexion with the conditional
sentence, although it is strange that  -??  in Nu 32:23 appears after ??????? in the protasis.
In Nu 16:29, 32:20  -??  as before ? (as in Jb 31:10 in the apodosis) is to be explained
from the dislike of hiatus.

(c) Cohortative (see § 108 e) in the protasis; perfect in the apodosis, Ps 40:6; imperfect

consecutive, Jb 19:18
the apodosis, cf. § 108 f.

?????????????? ????

???

 (if) I arise, they speak against me; on the cohortative in

(d) Imperfect consecutive in the protasis (§ 111 x), Ps 139:11 ???????? if I say, &c. (with a
noun-clause as the apodosis); with a frequentative perfect consecutive in the apodosis, 1 S
2:16.

(e) Perfect consecutive in the protasis and apodosis (see the examples, § 112 kk and ll),
Gn 44:22 ????? ????? ??????? and should he leave his father, his father would die; 9:15, 44:29, Ex
4:14, 12:13, 1 S 16:2, 19:3, 2 S 13:28, 1 K 8:30; with frequentative perfects, Ex 16:21
(referring to the past, Jer 20:9); with imperfect in the apodosis (being separated from the W?w
by ???), Nu 23:20, Jb 5:24; introduced by an infinitive absolute, 1 K 2:37; an interrogative
clause in the apodosis, Lv 10:19; a noun-clause, Ps 37:10, Jb 7:21.

(f) A simple perfect (to represent actions which are to be regarded as completed) in the
protasis and apodosis, Pr 18:22 ??? ????? ?????? ????? has one found a wife, he has found a good
thing; an imperfect in the apodosis, Jb 19:4, 23:10; an imperfect consecutive, Ex 20:25, Pr
11:2, Jb 3:25, 2313 b, 29:11; an interrogative clause, Nu 12:14, Jb 7:20 if I have sinned (prop.,
well, now I have sinned!) what can I do unto thee? 21:31, 35:6, Am 3:8; a noun-clause, Jb
27:19.

(g) A participle as casus pendens (cf. § 143 d, and the sections of the Grammar there
cited, esp. § 116 w) or a complete noun-clause in the protasis; the apodosis mostly introduced
by w?w apodosis, e. g. Pr 23:24 Keth. ?? ??? ?????? ????? ????? if one begetteth a wise child, he shall
have joy of him; with perfect frequentative in the apodosis, 1 S 2:13, &c.; but also with a
simple imperfect, e. g. Ex 21:12 (cf. § 112 n); with an interrogative imperfect, 2 K 7:2, 19;
with an interrogative perfect, Ju 6:13.

(h) Infinitive with preposition (also as the equivalent of a conditional clause) in the
 ???

protasis, and a perfect consecutive in the apodosis (cf. § 112 mm), e. g. 2 S 7:14 ff.
??? ????????????? if he commit iniquity, I will correct him; Ex 34:34 f. (with imperfect, followed by
perfects frequentative in the apodosis).

???????

Rem. On the expression of condition and consequence by means of two co-ordinate

imperatives, see § 110 f.

3. Particles used to introduce conditional sentences are ??? (for which in the later
and latest Books sometimes ???, see below, under w) and ??1 (1 S 14:30, Is 63:19 ???;
Ec 6:6, Est 7:4 ????, from ?? ???) if, negative ??? ??? and ????? (?????) unless; ??? supposing
that (Lat. ut), in case that, sometimes used almost in the same sense as ???. With
regard to the difference between ??? (??? ???) and ?? (?????), the fundamental rule is that
??? is used if the condition be regarded either as already fulfilled, or if it, together with
its consequence, be thought of as possibly (or probably) occurring in the present or
future. In the former case, ??? is followed by the perfect, in the latter (corresponding to
the Greek ??? with the present subjunctive) by the imperfect or its equivalent
(frequently in the apodosis also). On the other hand, ?? (?????) is used when the
condition is to be represented as not fulfilled in the past, or as not capable of fulfilment
in the present or future, and the consequence accordingly as not having occurred or
never occurring. In the former case, ?? and ????? are necessarily followed by the perfect

1 1 On ?? cf. Kohler in Geiger’s Zeitschr. für Wiss. und Leben, vi (1868), p. 21 ff.

(mostly also in the apodosis) corresponding to the Greek ?? with the indicative of an
historic tense, and the Latin imperfect or pluperfect subjunctive. In the latter case
(which is extremely rare) the perfect, or the participle, or even the imperfect, may be
used.

Rem. Since it again frequently depends on the subjective judgement of the speaker (see
under a), whether a condition is to be regarded as possible or impossible, we cannot wonder
that the distinction between ??? and ?? is not always consistently observed. Although naturally
?? and ????? cannot take the place of ??? and ??? ??? (on the strange use of ?? in Gn 50:15 see
below), yet conversely ??? is sometimes used where ?? would certainly be expected; cf. e. g. Ps
50:12, 137:5, 139:8, Ho 9:12 (cf. verse 11). These examples, indeed (??? with the imperfect),
may without difficulty be explained from the fact that the connexion of ?? with the imperfect
was evidently avoided, because the imperfect by its nature indicates a still unfinished action,
and consequently (as opposed to ??) a still open possibility. But ??? is also used for ?? in
connexion with the perfect, especially when an imprecation is attached by the apodosis to the
 if I have done this …, let
??? ????????
condition introduced by ???, e. g. Ps 7:4 ff.
the enemy pursue my soul, &c., cf. Jb 31:9 ff. The speaker assumes for a moment as possible
and even actual, that which he really rejects as inconceivable, in order to invoke the most
severe punishment on himself, if it should prove to be the case.

On the frequent addition of an infinitive absolute to the verb in clauses with ?? see § 113

o above.

Examples:—

A. ??? 1. with perfect in the protasis to express conditions, &c., which have been

completely fulfilled in the past or which will be completely fulfilled in the future (the perfect
is here equivalent to the futurum exactum, § 106 o). The apodosis1 takes—

(a) A perfect also, e. g. Pr 9:12
thyself; Ps 73:15 (see below on ??).

???

?? ????

???? ????

????????

 if thou art wise, thou art wise for

(b) Imperfect, e. g. Dt 32:41 ????? ?????? if I whet my glittering sword … ?? ??? I will render
vengeance, &c.; Jb 9:15 f.30 (in both cases we should expect ?? rather than ????; so also in Ps
44:21 f., with an interrogative imperfect in the apodosis); Jb 11:13 (the apodosis is in verse
15).

(c) Jussive (or optative), e. g. Jb 31:9 ff. (see m above); Gn 18:3.

(d) Perfect consecutive (see the examples in § 112 gg), e. g. Gn 43:9 ??? ???????????? ??????? if

I bring him not … then I shall have sinned, &c.; Ju 16:17, 2 S 15:33, 2 K 7:4. On the other
hand, e. g. Gn 47:6, Mi 5:7, Jb 7:4 refer to actions already completed; in Gn 38:9 and Nu 21:9
the perfect with ?? is a perfect frequentative and refers to past time.

(e) Imperfect consecutive (see § 111 q), e. g. Jb 8:4 if thy children have sinned (???????) …,

????? ?????? he has delivered them, &c.

1 1 We are not here concerned with the fact that the logical apodosis (the consequence
of the condition) is sometimes mentioned before the condition; as in Gn 18:28, 30, Ju
11:10, Ps 63:6 f., 137:6, and according to Dillmann Is 4:4.

(f) Imperative, e. g. Gn 50:4

??? ?????????? ???????????? ??? ????
???? ???????
?
in your eyes, speak, I pray you, &c.; the imperative precedes in Gn 47:16 and Jb 38:4, 18.

 if now I have found grace

(g) A (complete or incomplete) noun-clause, e. g. Jer 14:18 (a vivid realization of the

future) if I have gone forth into the field (= if I go, &c.), then, behold, the slain with the
sword! &c.; Pr 24:14 (apodosis with w?w apodosis).

2. ??? with imperfect in the protasis, to express what is possible in the present or future, as
well as (according to § 107 b) what has continued or been repeated in the past. The apodosis
takes—

(a) The perfect, e. g. Nu 32:23 ???????? ????? ??? ???????? ????????? but if ye will not do so, behold,
ye have sinned; here the apodosis represents the time when the consequence has already taken
place; so also Jb 20:12–14. On the other hand, Nu 16:29 (as also 1 S 6:9 and 1 K 22:28) is a
case of a pregnant construction, if these men die as all men die, then (it will follow from this)
the Lord hath not sent me.

(b) The imperfect, e. g. 2 K 7:4

 if they save us alive, we shall live, &c.; Gn
??????????
?
13:16, 18:28, 30, 28:20 ff., Ex 20:25 (the second imperfect is equivalent to a jussive); Is 1:18,
10:22, Am 9:2–4, Ps 50:12 (where ??? ironically represents an impossibility as possible); Jb
8:5 f. (with the insertion of a second condition in the form of a noun-clause); 9:3, 20, 14:7; a
frequentative imperfect referring to the past, Gn 31:8 ?????? ??????? if (ever) he said thus …,
????????? then they bare …; Ex 40:37. In Gn 42:37 the consequence (on ?????? cf. § 107 s) precedes
the condition.

(c) The jussive (or optative), e. g. Ps 137:5; cf. § 109 h.

(d) The cohortative, e. g. Gn 13:9, Jb 31:7; cf. § 108 f.

(f) The imperfect consecutive; so perhaps Ps 59:16, if

???

 is to be explained according to

§ 111 t.

(g) The imperative, e. g. Gn 31:50, 1 S 20:21 (with w?w apodosis, but in verse 22 simply

????), 21:10, Jb 33:5.

(h) A noun-clause, e. g. Gn 4:7, Ps 139:8, Jb 8:6, 31:26 f.

3. ??? with cohortative, e. g. Gn 30:31; cf. the passages in § 108 e.

4. ??? with infinitive, Jb 9:27 ?????????? prop. if my saying is (but probably we should read
????

).

?????

5. ??? with a noun-clause, e. g. Dt 5:22 (in the apodosis a perfect with w?w apodosis), Gn

27:46, Ju 9:15 (imperative in the apodosis); 11:9 (imperfect in the apodosis); 2 S 12:8
(cohortative in the apodosis); Ho 12:12; especially if the subject of the conditional clause be a
personal pronoun. In an affirmative sentence this pronoun is often joined to ???, in a negative
sentence to ???? (cf. on both, § 100 o), while the predicate (cf. § 116 q) is represented by a
participle, usually expressing the future, e. g. Ju 6:36 f.

 if thou will save, &c.; Gn

?? ????????

??? ????

24:49 ?? ???? ??? ???????? if ye will deal, &c.; 1 S 23:23. In Gn 24:42 f. the condition is expressed
in a more humble form by the addition of ???. With ???? Gn 43:5 ???? ???? ?????????????? but if thou wilt
not send, &c.; 20:7 (with imperative in the apodosis); Ex 8:17, 9:2 f., 1 S 19:11 (all with a
participle also in the apodosis). But ??? and  ?????
??? Gn 23:8, 1 S 20:8, 2 K 9:15, &c.,  ?????
2 K 2:10; cf. also ??????? if it be so, Gn 25:22.

 (if it be not the case) Gn 30:1, Ex 32:32, Ju 9:15,

 may also be used after ??? without a suffix; thus

????

B. ??? if, generally supposed to be originally identical with ??? behold!1 Probably, however,

??? if, is a pure Aramaism, and since the Aramaic word never has the meaning behold, it is at
least improbable that it had originally any connexion with ??? or ?????. Cf. Ex 8:22, Lv 25:20, Is
54:15, Jer 3:1, Hag 2:12, 2 Ch 7:13, and frequently in Job, as 9:11, 12, 12:14, 15, 19:7, 23:8,
40:23, always with w?w apodosis following, except in 13:15, where consequently the
meaning see is no doubt preferable.

C. ?? if, ????? (?????) if not.

1. With perfect in the protasis and apodosis (cf. § 106 p), e.g. Ju 8:19; ???? is used in the

same sense as ?? in Est 7:4, cf. Ec 6:6 (with a question in the apodosis).—With the perfect in
protasis and apodosis after ????? Gn 31:42, 43:10, Ju 14:18, 1 S 25:34, 2 S 2:27, Is 1:9. On the
other hand, in Dt 32:29 ?? with a perfect is followed by an imperfect in the apodosis, if they
were wise, they would understand this; in Mi 2:11 by a perfect consecutive.

2. With imperfect after ????? Dt 32:27, ???? probably as the modus rei repetitae, were it not
that I ever and again feared, &c.; so also the imperfect after ?? with the apodosis suppressed,
Gn 50:15 supposing that Joseph should hate us; since, according to the context, the danger
was real, the use of ?? here is strange; conversely in other cases, e.g. Ps 73:15, Jb 9:15 f.30, ??
would be more natural than ???.

3. A noun-clause occurs after ?? 2 S 18:12, 2 K 3:14, Ps 81:14, all with imperfect in the

apodosis; Jb 16:4 ??? ??, with cohortative in the apodosis.

D. ??? supposing that, if:—

1. ??? with perfect in the protasis, e.g. Nu 5:20 ???? ?? ??? ????? but thou, if thou hast gone
astray, &c.; with a frequentative perfect consecutive in the apodosis, Jb 7:13 f.; with an
imperfect consecutive, Jb 22:29.

2. ??? with imperfect in the protasis, e.g. Ps 23:4 ??????????? ??? yea, though I walk (have to
 if thou buy an

walk)…, I will fear no (???????????) evil; 37:24; Ex 21:2
Hebrew servant, six years shall he serve (but in verses 3–5 a series of definite conditions with
definite consequences is introduced by ???; so also the ??? in verse 7 is followed in verses 8–11
by the special cases with ???; cf. also verse 17 ff.); cf. Gn 4:24, 24:41, Jb 38:5; with a perfect
consecutive in the apodosis, Gn 32:18 f., Ex 18:16; with a noun-clause, Is 1:15.

??? ??????? ???
?? ????????????
?

3. ??? with a noun-clause (and imperfect in the apodosis), 2 S 19:8.

Rem. According to § 107 q, ???? is naturally followed by the imperfect; for the exceptions,

2 S 20:6, 2 K 2:16, see § 107 q, note 3; cf. moreover, 2 K 10:23 ??????????? ???? look lest there
be here, &c.

1 1 There could be no doubt of their identity if ??????? in 1 S 9:7, 2 S 18:11, simply meant
if. We must, however, keep to the meaning but behold.

(k) ????????? that … not, with the imperfect, Ex 20:20, 2 S 14:14 (in Jer 23:14 read the

infinitive ??? for
by ??= according to things which they have not seen.

????? , in 27:8

?????

 for

???

????

). In Ez 13:3 ????? ??????? is a relative clause governed

2. Two negatives in the same sentence do not neutralize each other (as in nonnulli,
non nemo), but make the negation the more emphatic (like ??? ??????, ??? ????µ??,
nulli—non, nemo non); e.g. Zp 2:2 (if the text is correct)
shall (not) come.1 This especially applies to the compounds formed by the union of ????
or ????? with ???? without (§ 119 y), e.g. Is 5:9 (611) ? ???? ?????? (for which in Jer 2:15  ???????
? ???), prop. without no inhabitant, i.e. so that no inhabitant is left there. On the other
 the ???? is causative, because there is no water; as also in Ex
hand, in Is 50:2
14:11 ????? ????????? is it because there were no …? 2 K 1:3, 6, 16. In Ec 3:11 ??? ? ???? ???????
except that (yet so that man cannot, &c.).

 before there

?????????? ???

?? ??????

?????

????

3. The negative sometimes extends its influence from the first to a second negative

sentence parallel with it (which may or may not have W?w) ; e.g. 1 S 2:3 talk not so
much arrogancy; let (not) boasting come out of your mouth; Ex 28:43, Lv 19:12, 22:9,
15 f., Nu 16:14, 23:19, Dt 7:25, Is 23:4, 28:27, 38:18, 47:14, Ez 16:47, Ps 9:19, 13:5,
35:19, 38:2, 44:19, 75:6, Jb 28:17 (so
??? ???  why … not? in Jb 3:11 also affects the
parallel clause).

???

§ 153. Restrictive and Intensive Clauses.

The particles ???, ??? only, serve to introduce restrictive clauses, and ???, ?? also,
besides, even, intensive clauses. It is to be observed that the force of these particles
does not necessarily affect the word which immediately follows (as is the case with ???
Gn 7:23, 34:15; ??? Gn 6:5, Am 3:2; even ??? ????? hath he indeed only? Nu 12:2; ??? Gn
27:34, Jb 7:11; ?? Dt 15:17), but very frequently extends to the whole of the
following sentence. Thus with ???, e.g. Nu 14:9, 1 K 17:13, Pr 17:11, Jb 13:15, 14:22,
16:7, 23:6; ??? Gn 20:11, 24:8, Ps 32:6, Pr 13:10; ??? Gn 27:33, 32:21 (????? ???), 44:10; 1
S 22:7, 28:20, Zc 9:11, Pr 17:26, 20:11; ?? Jb 14:3, 15:4.—In Mal 1:10 and Jb 2:10 ???
is placed before two co-ordinate sentences, although, strictly speaking, it applies only
to the second. Cf. the analogous examples in § 150 m.

§ 154. Sentences connected by W?w.

W?w copulativum1 (??) serves to connect two or more sentences, or single words
(on its various vocalization, cf. § 104 d–g). Its use, however, is by no means restricted

1 1 In 1 K 10:21
LXX and Lucian, to
1

???? ???(cid:31)???

.

???????(cid:31)???

 goes with what precedes and must be emended, with the

1 For further particulars of the use of w?w copulativum, see Gesenius’ Thesaurus,

i. 393 ff. On its use in the co-ordination of similar tenses and moods (e.g. five
imperfects consecutive in Gn 25:34, five perfects with ?????) as well as of dissimilar
tenses and moods, the remarks made in the treatment of the tenses will suffice. With
regard to the connexion of single nouns by ?? (which strictly speaking is always really

merely to joining sentences which are actually co-ordinate. Frequently the language
employs merely the simple connexion by W?w, even to introduce an antithesis (Gn
17:21, 19:19, Lv 2:12, Jb 6:25, and very frequently in circumstantial noun-clauses), or

a contraction of so many clauses into a single sentence) the following observations
may be made:—

(a) Contrary to English usage, which in lengthy enumerations uses the and to
connect only the last member of the series, in Hebrew polysyndeton is customary, as
in Gn 12:16 w?w copulativum six times, 24:35 seven times, 15:19 ff. nine times, and
in Jos 7:24 ten times. Sometimes, however, only the last two words are joined (so in a
series of three members, Gn 5:32, 10:1, 11:26, 13:2, 14:1, 30:39, &c.; the last three
out of a series of four, Jer 2:26); less frequently only the first two, Ps 45:9; cf. § 132
d. The formula ????? ?? ????? yesterday (and) the day before yesterday, Ex 5:8, &c., is
always without the copula. On the other hand, the constructio asyndetos in a series of
verbs is used as a rhetorical expedient to produce a hurried and so an impassioned
description; e.g. Ju 5:27 at her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay; Ex 15:9, Dt 32:15, 1 S
15:6, Jer 4:7, Am 5:21, Ps 10:10, 14:1, 45:5, Jb 20:19, 28:4, 29:8, Ct 2:11, 5:6, &c.

(b) Frequently w?w copulativum is also explanatory (like isque, et—quidem, and
the German und zwar, English to wit), and is then called w?w explicativum, e.g. Gn
4:4 and (i.e. namely) of the fat thereof (unless it is simply copulative); Ex 24:12, 25:12
(to wit two); 27:14, 28:23, Ju 17:3 (in ????????; here as often elsewhere, to introduce an
explanatory gloss, cf. Is 17:8, Ez 3:15, and especially P. Haupt, SBOT. Isaiah, p. 90, l.
21 ff.), 1 S 17:34 and that too with the bear; 2 S 13:20, Is 57:11, Jer 17:10, Am 3:11,
4:10, Ze 9:9, Pr 3:12, Neh 8:13, 2 Ch 23:10 (but in 1 S 28:3 the ? before ??????? is to be
omitted with the LXX); cf. also such combinations as ?????—??? from … and even to …,
Gn 13:3, 14:23, 19:4, 11, &c.—In 1 S 6:11 (see Driver on the passage), 2 S 1:23, &c.,
? is equivalent to yea, and; in Is 32:7 even.

?? is used to express emphasis (=and especially), e.g. in Gn 3:16 ???????????; Is 2:1, Ps

18:1, perhaps also in Jb 10:17 yea, a whole host; 2 Ch 16:14.—An undoubted
example of what is called w?w concomitantiae occurs in Jb 41:12 a seething pot ????????
with burning rushes; cf. Ex 10:10 (with your little ones), 12:8, Lv 1:12, Is 42:5. In
Arabic this w?w concom. is followed by the accusative.

??-??

 is used in the sense of both—and in Ps 76:7, Dn 1:3, 8:13. On  ??-??

 as meaning

sive—sive, cf. § 162 b.

?? ??????

 both together, Gn 27:45, Pr 17:15;

(c) See the Lexicon on adverbs used in a copulative sense, such as ??? also,
moreover, summing up a number, e.g.
(cid:31)???
??????? all together; as an intensive and, e.g. Gn 30:8, 37:7, 1 S 30:8; cf. also such
examples as 1 S 24:12 see, yea see!
 or
three times in Gn 24:25 and 32:20; also ??, which is generally still more intensive, in
the sense of also, in addition to this, even, and belongs rather to poetry, and to the
later language; frequently also equivalent to a mere and, but sometimes adversative
but now, Ps 44:10, &c.; and
 (also three times), equivalent to both—and; cf.  ????
??? and even, Lv 26:44; ?????? prop. add to this also that, equivalent to not to mention,
according to the context either quanto magis or quanto minus.

 Gn 24:44=both—and; ??? occurs

???-?????

??-??

???-???

when one of the two clauses is not co-ordinated, but subordinated to the other. On the
use of ?? to introduce circumstantial clauses, cf. especially § 141 e and § 142 d;
introducing causal clauses, § 158 a; comparative clauses, § 161 a; final clauses, § 165
a; consecutive clauses, § 166 a. On w?w apodosis, cf. § 143 d, and the sections there
cited; on the use of W?w in numerical sayings, cf. § 134 s.

Rem. Sometimes w?w copulativum joins a sentence apparently to what immediately
precedes, but in reality to a sentence which is suppressed and which must, therefore, be
supplied from the context. So especially ?? with imperatives to express inferences, e.g. 1 K
2:22 ?????? ???? ask now rather; Ez 18:32 for I have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth …,
??? ?????? wherefore turn yourselves. Also at the beginning of a speech in loose connexion with
an act or speech of another person, e.g. Ex 2:20, 2 S 18:11, 24:3, 2 K 4:14, 41, 7:13, 2 Ch
25:9; cf. also Jos 7:7 (????), Ps 2:10, 4:4, Is 8:7. Sometimes the suppression of the protasis is
due to passionate excitement or haste, which does not allow time for full expression; this is
especially illustrated by Nu 12:14, 20:3 (????), 1 S 10:12, 15:14, 22:14, 28:16, 2 S 18:12, 24:3,
1 K 2:22 (
circumstantial clause whereas I=and yet I have, &c.); cf. also a new clause beginning with the
formula of wishing ???? Nu 11:29, Ju 9:29; on the disconnected use of ????? and ????? cf. § 159 dd.

???????? ), 2 K 1:10, 7:19 (cf. verse 2); Is 3:14, Zc 2:10, Ps 2:6 (at the same time a

§ 155. Relative Clauses.

See V. Baumann, Hebräische Relatîvsätze, Leipzig, 1894 (cf. the heading of § 138
above); G. Bergsträsser, ‘Das hebr. Präfix ?, ’ ZATW 1909, p. 40 ff.1

1. By § 138 a, e, relative clauses are divided into two classes: those which are
used for the nearer definition of a noun (substantive or pronoun), and those which are
not dependent on a noun. The former may be called incomplete, the latter complete
relative clauses.

Complete relative clauses, as a rule (see the exceptions under n), are introduced by

the originally demonstrative pronoun ? ????; see further in § 138 e. Similarly,
incomplete relative clauses may also be introduced by ? ????, or by some other
demonstrative pronoun; see further in § 138 a and g–k. Very frequently, however,
especially in poetic style, the attributive relation is expressed by simple co-
ordination.1

The governing substantive or pronoun is frequently (in certain cases always)
resumed by a pronominal suffix or an adverb. The resumption may, however, be
omitted, just as in relative clauses introduced by ? ????, &c.; see § 138 f.

1 1 In this exhaustive article the author shows that between ? (on the pronunciation
see § 36) and ? ???? there is syntactically no primary difference, but only a secondary
distinction which arose in the course of the development of the language, namely that
? ???? is preferred in combinations which are customary in the old literary language, and
? in those which are derived from the popular language or from Aramaic.
1 1 The old view that all these cases arise from the omission of ? ???? is incorrect. These
co-ordinated attributive clauses are rather a mere subdivision of the various kinds of
circumstantial clauses (see § 156) which may be attached to a nomen regens. Cf. in
English this is the letter (which) he wrote to me.

In Arabic a distinction is made between relative clauses used for the nearer definition of a

determinate substantive (?ila), and those which are attached to an indeterminate substantive
(?ifa). The former must be introduced by the demonstrative pronoun alla???, the latter are
always simply co-ordinated. The same distinction was no doubt originally observed in
Hebrew, since simply co-ordinated relative clauses are most commonly found after
indeterminate substantives (see the examples below), and in cases like Dt 28:49 ( ? ???? ???
?????? ??? ????????? a nation whose tongue thou shalt not understand; cf. Is 66:13, and especially 1
S 3:11), the addition of ? ???? is explained from the special stress laid on the indeterminate
substantive,2 a nation of such a kind, thou understandest not their tongue. On the other hand,
in poetic style at least, ? ???? is somewhat frequently omitted even after a determinate noun, but
only rarely in prose (except by the Chronicler; cf. 1 Ch 9:22, 12:23, 29:1 (read prob. ? ???? for
?????), 2 Ch 15:11; after ???? 1 Ch 29:3, 2 Ch 18:23, 30:17, 31:19, Ezr 1:5, but also Gn 39:4; for
further instances, see Driver, Introd.8, p. 537, no. 30); so Ex 18:20, Ju 8:1, 20:15, 1 K 13:12
(=which way), so 2 K 3:8, 2 Ch 18:23; Neh 13:23; after a pronominal subject, 1 S 6:9. In Jer
52:12 for ????? read ????? with the LXX.

2. If the nearer definition of a substantive or pronoun is effected by simple co-

ordination of the relative clause, it may take the form—

(a) Of a noun-clause, e.g. 2 S 20:21 a man of the hill country of Ephraim

?? ?? ???
???
whose name was Sheba; Zc 6:12, Jb 1:1, 3:15 with princes ????? ????? that had gold; Ps
11:4, Pr 22:11; when referring to a noun-suffix, e.g. Ps 49:14
 this is
the way of them who have (self-)confidence.—On periphrases of this kind to express
negative attributes, as in Jb 38:26
152 u, and cf. for this very short form of the relative clause, Gn 15:13
 in
a land that belongs not to them; Dt 32:17 (?????? ??? ?????????); Hb 1:6, Pr 26:17 (??????).

 on a land where no man is, see §
?????

???????? ???

????? ??? ???

?? ??????? ???

?? ???

?

?

(b) Of a verbal clause.

Here we must distinguish the cases in which the retrospective pronoun—

?????

??? ?????

 the night which said; after ???? Ps 71:18; referring to a vocative, which is

(1) Is the subject of the relative clause, and is contained in the verb; so after a
determinate substantive, Ps 34:9 happy is the man ??????????? that trusteth in him; Jb 33 b
??
determinate in itself even without the article, Is 54:1, or to a noun-suffix (see under e),
Ps 16:4; after an indeterminate substantive, e.g. Jb 31:12 it is a fire (that) devoureth
unto Abaddon; Dt 3217 b, 1 S 6:9, Is 55:13, 56:2, Ps 68:31, 78:6, Pr 30:17, La 1:10, 2
Ch 28:9; referring to the suffix in ??????? Is 28:16, prop. behold me, who have laid, &c.,
but perhaps the participle
participle ????? should be read instead of the imperfect); Ez 25:7. The relative clause is
used in this way especially to supply the place of an adjective, e.g. Gn 49:27
?????? ?????
a wolf that ravineth, i.e. a ravining wolf; Is 51:12; to express a negative quality, e.g. Is
40:20, Ho 4:14 ??????????? ??? an undiscerning people.

?????  is to be read; 29:14, 38:5 (but probably again the

??

Rem. Very frequently such relative sentences are attached to substantives which have the
particle of comparison ??  , e.g. Jb 7:2
?????
shadow, &c.; Dt 32:11, Is 62:1, Jer 23:29, Ho 6:3, Ps 42:2, 83:15, Jb 9:26, 11:16; so also after
???? Ps 58:5; after a determinate substantive, e.g. Is 53:7 (but the better reading is ? ???? without

 as a servant that earnestly desireth the

?????? ???? ???

the article), 61:10 f., Hb 2:14, Ps 49:13, 21, 125:1; see also the examples under h. Sometimes
it seems simpler in such cases, to take the verb directly as predicate to the preceding
substantive, and to explain ??   (for ? ???????; see Comparative Clauses, § 161 b) as a
conjunction—a view which even Hupfeld was ready to accept, at least as regards Ps 90:5,
125:1, Is 53:7, 61:11, but it can hardly be right.

(2) The cases in which the retrospective pronoun represents an accusative of the

object, or would do so if not suppressed, as it usually is in such cases in relative
clauses with ? ????, cf. §138 b. Examples with the retrospective pronoun are, Dt 32:17
??????? ??? ???????? gods whom they knew not (see also the end of the verse); after a
substantive with ??(see above, g), Jer 23:9, Jb 13:28. Without a retrospective pronoun,
after a determinate substantive, Ju 8:1, Ps 33:12 (preceded by a relative clause with
? ????); Jb 28:1. Other examples of this kind, though the article is omitted according to
poetic usage, are Is 15:7 (? ???? ???????, for which Jer 48:36 ? ???? ??????? with the substantive
in the construct state governing the relative clause, see § 130 d), Ps 7:16, 51:10, La
1:21.—Without the retrospective pronoun, after an indeterminate substantive, e.g. Is
 a live coal which he had taken with the tongs from off
6:6
?????????? ???????
the altar; Ex 15:17, Is 42:16 (4817, Ps 25:12, all after
);
?????
Is 64:2; Ec 10:5 (in 6:1 the same clause with ? ????); moreover, in Jer 14:18 read with
 into a land (that) they know not.
the LXX

?????????? ????? ????? ???
?

; but Ps 32:8

??????? ??? ???

?????? ???????

?????????

??????

?

(3) The cases in which the retrospective pronoun is dependent on a preposition, or

its place is taken by the adverb ? ??, as in Jer 2:6 end. Thus after a determinate
substantive, Ps 18:3 ??????????? ????? my rock in which I take refuge; Ex 18:20, Is 42:1; in
Jb 33 a also, the omission of the article with ??? is only a poetic licence. After an
indeterminate substantive, Jer 2:6, last clause but one; Ps 32:2.

In this case also the retrospective word is not infrequently suppressed, giving rise

to extremely short, bold expressions, such as Is 51:1 look unto the rock ?????????
(whence) ye were hewn, and to the hole of the pit ????????? (whence) ye were digged; Jb
21:27 the devices (where-with) ye act violently against me.—A retrospective adverb is
suppressed in Jb 38:19 where is the way (to the place where) the light dwelleth? cf.
38:24.

Rem. 1. The omission of the retrospective word occurs most frequently in relative clauses
which are governed by the construct state of a preceding substantive (especially an expression
of time) and hence are virtually in the genitive. In addition to the instances already given in §
130 d, cf. the following: after ????? Lv 7:35, Ps 56:10; after ????? Jer 36:2; after simple ??? Ps
56:4 ( ????? ???
?
when the burnt offering began); 20:22, 24:11, Jb 6:17; after ????? Dt 32:35; after ??????? Mi 5:2;
after ????? Ps 4:8 thou hast put gladness in my heart more than (their gladness) at the time
(when) their corn and their wine are increased.

 on the day when I am afraid); after ????? 2 Ch 29:27 (???????? ????? ????? at the time

2. The agreement (§ 138 d) of the retrospective pronoun with a pronominal regens in the

1st or 2nd person also takes place in a simple co-ordinated relative clause in 1 S 26:14 who
art thou (that) criest? Cf., however, Is 63:19 we are become as they over whom (??? not
????? )
thou no longer bearest rule.

3. Occasionally—chiefly in poetic or otherwise elevated style—even independent

relative clauses are simply co-ordinated with a regens, whereas we should expect

them always to be preceded by a demonstrative pronoun, on the analogy of the
examples in § 138 e. The suppressed pronoun would stand—

(a) As subject, Is 41:24 an abomination (is he) that chooseth you (but read

perhaps  ??????

?

); Jb 30:13, cf. § 152 u.

(b) As object, Is 41:2, with a retrospective pronoun; Mal 2:16 ??????? and him that
covereth (or read ????????); Jb 29:12 I delivered … the fatherless also, and him that had
none to help him.

(c) In the genitive governed by a substantive (cf. § 130 d), Ex 4:13  ??????? ??

???? ?????????? send, I pray thee, by the hand of him whom thou wilt send, i.e. by the hand
of some one else; Ps 65:5 and Pr 8:32, verbal-clauses after ??? ???? O the happiness of
the man, &c.; Ps 81:6, 141:9, Jb 29:16, La 1:14; after ???? Gn 39:4, but we must
certainly read here, with the Samaritan and LXX, ?????? ? ???????? as in verses 5 and 8;
Ex 9:4; verbal-clauses after ???? 1 Ch 29:3, 2 Ch 30:19, 31:19, Ezr 1:5.

(d) Governed by a preposition; so verbal-clauses after ??????? Jer 2:8; after ???? (=to
the place where), 1 Ch 15:12, but Ex 23:20 before the same verb ? ???? ???????????; after ??
Jer 2:11, 2 Ch 1:4 (?????????=???????=to the place where); after ?? Is 65:1  ? ?? ?????
 by them
that asked not for me …
 them that sought me not; Ez 13:3 that which they
have not seen, but the text is hardly correct; after ??? Ps 119:136, cf. § 158 b; after ??? 2
Ch 16:9.—A noun-clause follows ?? in Neh 8:10. An analogous instance in Aramaic is
Ezr 5:14 to one whose name was Sheshbazzar [so in the papyri, see the Lexicon, p.
1116a].

§ 156. Circumstantial Clauses.

1. The statement of the particular circumstances under which a subject appears as
performing some action, or under which an action (or an occurrence) is accomplished,
is made especially (apart from relative clauses, see § 155) by means of noun-clauses
connected by W?w with a following subject (see further on this kind of circumstantial
clause in § 141 e), and by verbal-clauses (see § 142 d). Very frequently, however,
such statements of the particular circumstances are subordinated to the main clause by
being simply attached, without W?w, either as noun-clauses, sometimes extremely
short (see c), or as verbal-clauses (see d–g).

Rem. Among relative clauses of this kind the commonest are the various noun-clauses,
which are most closely subordinated to a preceding substantive without ? ????, e.g. Gn 16:12;
also statements of weight, Gn 24:22; of name, Jb 1:1 (also introduced by ?? ??? Gn 24:29, 1 S
1:1, &c., or ??? ??? Gn 16:1, 22:24, &c.); of a condition of body, Ju 1:7, and others.—Noun-
clauses which begin with w?w and the predicate have a somewhat more independent
character than those introduced by w?w and the subject1 (Gn 19:1, &c.). The former,
however, are also to be regarded as circumstantial clauses, in so far as they describe a state
which is simultaneous with the principal action; thus Is 3:7 I will not be an healer,  ???? ?????????

1 1 In Dt 32:31 this form of sequence appears to be selected for another purpose, and
indeed our enemies are judges thereof, with w?w emphatic; to take it as a
circumstantial clause is too artificial.

??????  while in my house is neither bread nor clothing; Is 6:6 (Am 7:7); 2 S 13:18, 16:1. Cf.
also the instances in § 152 l of ?????? followed by a participle, as ?????? ??????, &c.

2. Characteristic examples of circumstantial noun-clauses are Gn 12:8 and pitched

??? ?

?????

?????? ????? ?????????

S 18:14 through the heart of Absalom,

?
(cf. Ct 3:8), Na 3:8, Zc 14:5, 2 Ch 23:10; with the predicate preceding, e.g. 1 S 26:13,
Ps 32:8.—In Gn 41:29 a noun-clause serves to announce a state in the future.—We
may also include here certain set phrases, as ?????????? ?????? face to face (prop. while face
was turned towards face), Gn 32:31, Ex 33:11, Dt 34:10, &c.;1 so also to cast oneself
down,
??????  in 1 K 1:31, Is 49:23).2—Cf. finally the formula ?????????? ??? mother with children,
Gn 32:12; cf. Ho 10:14 and § 119 aa note 2.

 the face being turned to the earth, Gn 19:1, &c. (for ??????? we find

??????? ???

????

Rem. On circumlocutions of this kind to express negative attributes by means of short

noun-clauses (complete or incomplete), cf. § 152 u.

3. As circumstantial verbal-clauses,3 we find (1) sometimes affirmative clauses
(see below), but far more frequently (2) negative clauses (see f), and among these (3)
a certain number of expressions which may be regarded simply as equivalent to
negative adverbial ideas (see g).

Examples of (1) Is 511 b woe unto them, that tarry late in the evening,

???
inflames them; Is 1:5, 10:24, 30:31, Jer 7:26, 20:15, Ps 4:3, 5:12, 21:13, 62:5. The
circumstantial verbal-clause is used to particularize an action which has before been
expressed generally, in Gn 44:12, 48:14=crossing his hands; Dt 2:27, Ju 6:19; antithetically, 1
K 13:18 ?? ????? wherewith however he lied unto him. The verbal-clause seems to assign a
reason in Ps 7:7
103:5.4

 since thou hast commanded judgement; a consequence in Ps

?????????? ???  while wine

???? ??? ????

????

Rem. On the cases in which an imperfect in the sense of a final clause is subordinated to a

verb of motion (generally ???), see § 120 c.

Of (2), subordinate verbal-clauses with ??? (in English usually rendered by without and

the gerund, if the subject be the same as in the principal clause), e.g. Lv 1:17
dividing it asunder; Jb 31:34; ??? with the perfect is so used in Gn 44:4, Ex 34:28, 1 S 30:2,
Jb 20:26 (without its being blown upon it). With a different subject, equivalent to a

?? ???

1 1 The expression ?????? ???????? to look one another in the face (i.e. to contend in
combat) 2 K 14:8, 11, 2 Ch 25:17, 21, is probably only a shortened form for  ????????

3 3 Some examples of these have been already discussed in another connexion above,
§ 120 a–c.

harmonizing transposition; read

§ 157. Object-Clauses (Oratio Obliqua).

Clauses which depend on a transitive verb, especially on what are called verba
cordis, i.e. verbs denoting any mental act, such as to see, to hear, to know, to perceive,
to believe, to remember, to forget, to say, to think, &c., may be subordinated to the
governing verb without the help of a conjunction by simple juxtaposition (§ 120 a), or
they may be co-ordinated with it either with or without w?w copulative (§ 120 d–h).
As a rule, however, the objective clause is introduced by the conjunction ??? that, less
frequently by  ?????

 that.1

Examples:—

(a) Object-clauses without a conjunction. Besides the passages mentioned in § 120

(especially under e) there are a number of examples, in which a clause depending on a verbum
dicendi or sentiendi (the oratio obliqua of the Latin and English Grammar) is added in the
form of an independent noun-clause or verbal-clause; e. g. Gn 12:13
 say, I
pray thee, thou art my sister; Ps 10:13, Jb 253a.14, Neh 6:6; Zc 8:23 (after ??? ??); Ps 9:21 (after
?????); verbal-clauses, e. g. Ps 50:21 thou thoughtest  ??? ??????????????
 I was surely like thyself [but
read ???? for ?????]; Gn 41:15, Ju 9:48 what ye have seen me do; Is 48:8, Ho 7:2.

???? ???????????

? ???

????

???

(b) Object-clauses introduced by ???, e. g. Gn 6:5

??????? ????? ?

???? ??? ??????? ???????

 and the Lord

saw that the wickedness of man was great, &c.—Direct narration also is very frequently
introduced by ??? (analogous to the ??? recitativum; frequently, indeed, with the secondary idea
of a particle of asseveration, as in Gn 26:9, 27:20), e. g. Gn 21:30, 22:16 f., 26:22, 29:32,
37:35, Jos 2:24, &c., even when the direct narration is not expressly indicated, Gn 4:25,
32:31, 41:51 f., Ex 18:4.—On the expression of a second object by means of a clause
introduced by ???, see § 117 h.2

(c) Object-clauses introduced by ? ????, e. g. Est 3:4 ??????? ????? ???? ????? ??????????? for he had
told them that he was a Jew; 1 S 18:15, Ez 20:26, Ec 8:12, 3 even before direct narration, 1 S

1 1 On these clauses with ??? and ? ???? and generally on clauses which we should render
as subordinate, cf. P. Doörwald ‘Zur hebr. Syntax’ in Neue Jahrbb. für Philol. und
Pädag. 1890, p. 115 ff.
2 2 Instead of a complete objective clause we sometimes find a kind of accusative and
infinitive construction, especially after ????? (prop. to give up) in the sense of to allow,
e. g. Nu 21:23
through his border; 20:21; followed by an infinitive with ??, e. g. Gn 20:6, 31:7, Ex
3:19.—Cf. also the analogous examples in Dt 28:56 (after ????? to venture; see § 113 d);
Ju 11:20 (after????????? to trust); 1 K 19:4 (after ?? ?? to request).
3 3 In Jer 28:9 a subject-clause is thus introduced by ? ???? instead of the usual ???.

 and Sihon did not suffer Israel to pass

???? ????? ???????? ?????? ????????????

???????? ?

15:20, 2 S 1:4. Somewhat frequently ? ???? is preceded by the nota accusativi ???? (equivalent to
the circumstance, the fact, that), e. g. Jos 2:10, 1 S 24:11, 19, 2 S 11:20, Is 38:3, but in Gn
30:29, Dt 29:15 equivalent to the way in which.

§ 158. Causal Clauses.

A complete clause, assigning the reason for statements, demands, threats, &c.,
sometimes follows with the simple w?w copulative, e. g. Ps 60:13 give us help against
the adversary, and (for) vain is the help of man; Gn 6:17 (????????), 22:12, Ex 23:9, Jb
22:12, perhaps also Ps 7:10; or even without W?w, e. g. Gn 17:14. As a rule, however,
special conjunctions in various combinations are used to introduce causal clauses.

???

??? ???  Is 3:16, &c., and

The most common causal conjunctions are

? ???? ???  because, prop.
??????  Nu 20:12,

??????  is sometimes repeated for emphasis,

???
on account of the fact that; both, however, may also be shortened to the simple
&c., or to ??? because, Gn 3:14, 17, &c., or to ? ???? Gn 30:18, 31:49, 34:13, 27, 1 S 15:15,
20:42, 26:16, 23, 1 K 3:19, 8:33, Ho 14:4, Zc 1:15; also ? ??????? Gn 39:9, 23. On the other
hand, the simple
German sintemal und alldieweil) Lv 26:43, Ez 13:10 (without ? 36:3); also ? ???????? 2 S 3:30,
and ???????1 Dt 31:17, Ju 3:12, Mal 2:14 on the ground that; ? ???? ????????? because of the
circumstance that, Dt 23:5; ? ???? ????????????? for this very cause that, Jer 3:8. But just as the
simple
? ???? ??? , so also the simple ???? with the perfect stands for ? ???????? Ps
119:136, Ezr 3:11; cf. ????????? Gn 31:20 and ??????? Dt 28:55 both with the perfect, equivalent to
 ???
???
because … not.—Cf. further
??? (2 S 12:10 with the perfect; Am 4:12 with the imperfect) prop. in return for the fact that;
similarly again the simple
imperfect; finally, ? ??????? Is 43:4 arising from the fact that,= because;
&c., and

??????  Nu 14:24 with the perfect, and Dt 7:12, 8:20 with the

? ???? ???  Gn 22:18, 26:5, 2 S 12:6, all with the perfect, and

??? ???  Dt 4:37, Pr 1:29 for the reason that.

 (something like the
???

? ???? ???  1 S 26:21,

??????  is used for

???

???

Rem. 1. The preposition ???? (because of, on account of) with the infinitive (§ 114 e) is
frequently used as the equivalent of a full causal clause; cf. e. g. Am 1:3, 6, 13, 2:1, 6. Such a
construction with the infinitive may, however, according to § 114 r, be continued by means of
a finite verb, in which case ???? governs the verb as a conjunction; e. g. Am 1:9
??????? ????? because they delivered up … and remembered not, &c.; 1:11, 2:4; without W?w, Is
30:14.

 ??????????????

 ...

2. The choice of tenso is regulated by the general principles stated in § 106 ff., viz. the
perfect (cf. especially § 106 f) refers to causes already brought fully into effect, the imperfect
to those which may contingently arise; cf. e. g. Dt 7:12, 8:20, 1 K 8:33, where the imperfect
leaves the possibility still open that the persons addressed will perhaps escape the threatened
punishments by avoiding disobedience.—Cf. further, § 111 h on the imperfect consecutive,
and § 112 nn on the perfect consecutive in the apodosis to causal clauses.

1. The great variety of construction in conditional sentences is owing to the fact

that it frequently depends on the subjective judgement of the speaker, whether he
wishes a condition to be regarded as capable of fulfilment (absolutely, or at least
possibly), thus including those already fulfilled, or as incapable of fulfilment. On this
distinction depends the choice both of the conditional particle to be used (see below),
and especially (as also in Greek and Latin) of the tense. The use of the latter is
naturally determined according to the general principles laid down in § 106 ff.1 In the
following sketch, for the sake of clearness, conditional sentences without conditional
particles will be first discussed (under b), and afterwards sentences with these
particles (under l).

2. The relation between condition and consequence may be expressed, as in
English, by the simple juxtaposition of two clauses. At the same time, it is to be
observed in general as a fundamental rule (in accordance with the original character
of the two tenses), that the imperfect, with its equivalents (the jussive, cohortative,
imperative, perfect consecutive, and participle), is used to express a condition and
consequence which are regarded as being capable of fulfilment in present or future
time, while the perfect represents a condition already fulfilled in the past, and its
consequence as an accomplished fact. The other use of the perfect—to represent
conditions regarded as impossible—occurs only in connexion with particles.

Examples:—

2  ?????
(a) Imperfect (cf. § 107 x) in protasis and apodosis, Jos 22:18, Ps 104:28 ff.  ???????
????? (if) thou givest unto them, they gather, &c.; Ps 139:18, Pr 12:17, Jb 20:24, Ec 1:18, Neh
1:8; with an interrogative imperfect in the apodosis, Ju 13:12; with the jussive, Jb 10:16; with
the cohortative, Pr. 1:23; with the perfect, Is 26:10 (yet will he not learn righteousness; the
apodosis forcibly denies what the imperfect in the protasis had represented as still
conceivable; cf. Ho 8:12); with the perfect consecutive, Gn 47:25, Ex 33:5; with the protasis
suppressed, Jb 5:8 (see § 107 x).

???

(b) Jussive in protasis (cf. § 109 h, i) and apodosis, Ps 104:10

 (if) thou
makest darkness, it is night; imperfect in the apodosis, Ps 10429 b; cohortative Pr 1:23. Also in
Ex 7:9 ???????? ????? it shall become a serpent, is the apodosis to a suppressed protasis if thou cast
it down; so in 2 K 5:10 ??????? is the apodosis to a protasis if thou wash, contained in what
precedes.

??? ?????
?

?? ?????? ?? ??

??????

(c) Cohortative (see § 108 e) in the protasis; perfect in the apodosis, Ps 40:6; imperfect

consecutive, Jb 19:18
the apodosis, cf. § 108 f.

?????????????? ????

???

 (if) I arise, they speak against me; on the cohortative in

1 1 It may, moreover, happen that a different idea is introduced in the apodosis, from
that with which the protasis started—a source of many further variations.
2 2 On the termination  -??  cf. § 47 m. In verse 28 b also ????? ???? is probably to be
explained from its immediately preceding the greater pause. These terminations in
verses 28–30 and Ps 139:18 can scarcely have any connexion with the conditional
sentence, although it is strange that  -??  in Nu 32:23 appears after ??????? in the protasis.
In Nu 16:29, 32:20  -??  as before ? (as in Jb 31:10 in the apodosis) is to be explained
from the dislike of hiatus.

(d) Imperfect consecutive in the protasis (§ 111 x), Ps 139:11 ???????? if I say, &c. (with a
noun-clause as the apodosis); with a frequentative perfect consecutive in the apodosis, 1 S
2:16.

(e) Perfect consecutive in the protasis and apodosis (see the examples, § 112 kk and ll),
Gn 44:22 ????? ????? ??????? and should he leave his father, his father would die; 9:15, 44:29, Ex
4:14, 12:13, 1 S 16:2, 19:3, 2 S 13:28, 1 K 8:30; with frequentative perfects, Ex 16:21
(referring to the past, Jer 20:9); with imperfect in the apodosis (being separated from the W?w
by ???), Nu 23:20, Jb 5:24; introduced by an infinitive absolute, 1 K 2:37; an interrogative
clause in the apodosis, Lv 10:19; a noun-clause, Ps 37:10, Jb 7:21.

(f) A simple perfect (to represent actions which are to be regarded as completed) in the
protasis and apodosis, Pr 18:22 ??? ????? ?????? ????? has one found a wife, he has found a good
thing; an imperfect in the apodosis, Jb 19:4, 23:10; an imperfect consecutive, Ex 20:25, Pr
11:2, Jb 3:25, 2313 b, 29:11; an interrogative clause, Nu 12:14, Jb 7:20 if I have sinned (prop.,
well, now I have sinned!) what can I do unto thee? 21:31, 35:6, Am 3:8; a noun-clause, Jb
27:19.

(g) A participle as casus pendens (cf. § 143 d, and the sections of the Grammar there
cited, esp. § 116 w) or a complete noun-clause in the protasis; the apodosis mostly introduced
by w?w apodosis, e. g. Pr 23:24 Keth. ?? ??? ?????? ????? ????? if one begetteth a wise child, he shall
have joy of him; with perfect frequentative in the apodosis, 1 S 2:13, &c.; but also with a
simple imperfect, e. g. Ex 21:12 (cf. § 112 n); with an interrogative imperfect, 2 K 7:2, 19;
with an interrogative perfect, Ju 6:13.

(h) Infinitive with preposition (also as the equivalent of a conditional clause) in the
protasis, and a perfect consecutive in the apodosis (cf. § 112 mm), e. g. 2 S 7:14 ff.  ??????????
??? ????????????? if he commit iniquity, I will correct him; Ex 34:34 f. (with imperfect, followed by
perfects frequentative in the apodosis).

Rem. On the expression of condition and consequence by means of two co-ordinate

imperatives, see § 110 f.

3. Particles used to introduce conditional sentences are ??? (for which in the later
and latest Books sometimes ???, see below, under w) and ??1 (1 S 14:30, Is 63:19 ???;
Ec 6:6, Est 7:4 ????, from ?? ???) if, negative ??? ??? and ????? (?????) unless; ??? supposing
that (Lat. ut), in case that, sometimes used almost in the same sense as ???. With
regard to the difference between ??? (??? ???) and ?? (?????), the fundamental rule is that
??? is used if the condition be regarded either as already fulfilled, or if it, together with
its consequence, be thought of as possibly (or probably) occurring in the present or
future. In the former case, ??? is followed by the perfect, in the latter (corresponding to
the Greek ??? with the present subjunctive) by the imperfect or its equivalent
(frequently in the apodosis also). On the other hand, ?? (?????) is used when the
condition is to be represented as not fulfilled in the past, or as not capable of fulfilment
in the present or future, and the consequence accordingly as not having occurred or
never occurring. In the former case, ?? and ????? are necessarily followed by the perfect
(mostly also in the apodosis) corresponding to the Greek ?? with the indicative of an
historic tense, and the Latin imperfect or pluperfect subjunctive. In the latter case
(which is extremely rare) the perfect, or the participle, or even the imperfect, may be
used.

1 1 On ?? cf. Kohler in Geiger’s Zeitschr. für Wiss. und Leben, vi (1868), p. 21 ff.

Rem. Since it again frequently depends on the subjective judgement of the speaker (see
under a), whether a condition is to be regarded as possible or impossible, we cannot wonder
that the distinction between ??? and ?? is not always consistently observed. Although naturally
?? and ????? cannot take the place of ??? and ??? ??? (on the strange use of ?? in Gn 50:15 see
below), yet conversely ??? is sometimes used where ?? would certainly be expected; cf. e. g. Ps
50:12, 137:5, 139:8, Ho 9:12 (cf. verse 11). These examples, indeed (??? with the imperfect),
may without difficulty be explained from the fact that the connexion of ?? with the imperfect
was evidently avoided, because the imperfect by its nature indicates a still unfinished action,
and consequently (as opposed to ??) a still open possibility. But ??? is also used for ?? in
connexion with the perfect, especially when an imprecation is attached by the apodosis to the
condition introduced by ???, e. g. Ps 7:4 ff.
 if I have done this …, let
??? ????????
the enemy pursue my soul, &c., cf. Jb 31:9 ff. The speaker assumes for a moment as possible
and even actual, that which he really rejects as inconceivable, in order to invoke the most
severe punishment on himself, if it should prove to be the case.

 ???? ????

????????
?

 ...

On the frequent addition of an infinitive absolute to the verb in clauses with ?? see § 113

o above.

Examples:—

A. ??? 1. with perfect in the protasis to express conditions, &c., which have been

completely fulfilled in the past or which will be completely fulfilled in the future (the perfect
is here equivalent to the futurum exactum, § 106 o). The apodosis1 takes—

(a) A perfect also, e. g. Pr 9:12
thyself; Ps 73:15 (see below on ??).

???

?? ????

???? ????
?

????????
?

 if thou art wise, thou art wise for

(b) Imperfect, e. g. Dt 32:41 ????? ?????? if I whet my glittering sword … ?? ??? I will render
vengeance, &c.; Jb 9:15 f.30 (in both cases we should expect ?? rather than ????; so also in Ps
44:21 f., with an interrogative imperfect in the apodosis); Jb 11:13 (the apodosis is in verse
15).

(c) Jussive (or optative), e. g. Jb 31:9 ff. (see m above); Gn 18:3.

(d) Perfect consecutive (see the examples in § 112 gg), e. g. Gn 43:9 ??? ???????????? ??????? if

I bring him not … then I shall have sinned, &c.; Ju 16:17, 2 S 15:33, 2 K 7:4. On the other
hand, e. g. Gn 47:6, Mi 5:7, Jb 7:4 refer to actions already completed; in Gn 38:9 and Nu 21:9
the perfect with ?? is a perfect frequentative and refers to past time.

(e) Imperfect consecutive (see § 111 q), e. g. Jb 8:4 if thy children have sinned (???????) …,

????? ?????? he has delivered them, &c.

(f) Imperative, e. g. Gn 50:4

??? ???

??????? ???????????? ??? ????
???? ???????
?

 if now I have found grace

in your eyes, speak, I pray you, &c.; the imperative precedes in Gn 47:16 and Jb 38:4, 18.

(g) A (complete or incomplete) noun-clause, e. g. Jer 14:18 (a vivid realization of the

future) if I have gone forth into the field (= if I go, &c.), then, behold, the slain with the
sword! &c.; Pr 24:14 (apodosis with w?w apodosis).

1 1 We are not here concerned with the fact that the logical apodosis (the consequence
of the condition) is sometimes mentioned before the condition; as in Gn 18:28, 30, Ju
11:10, Ps 63:6 f., 137:6, and according to Dillmann Is 4:4.

2. ??? with imperfect in the protasis, to express what is possible in the present or future, as
well as (according to § 107 b) what has continued or been repeated in the past. The apodosis
takes—

(a) The perfect, e. g. Nu 32:23 ???????? ????? ??? ???????? ????????? but if ye will not do so, behold,
ye have sinned; here the apodosis represents the time when the consequence has already taken
place; so also Jb 20:12–14. On the other hand, Nu 16:29 (as also 1 S 6:9 and 1 K 22:28) is a
case of a pregnant construction, if these men die as all men die, then (it will follow from this)
the Lord hath not sent me.

?? ??

??????

(b) The imperfect, e. g. 2 K 7:4

 if they save us alive, we shall live, &c.; Gn
??????????
?
13:16, 18:28, 30, 28:20 ff., Ex 20:25 (the second imperfect is equivalent to a jussive); Is 1:18,
10:22, Am 9:2–4, Ps 50:12 (where ??? ironically represents an impossibility as possible); Jb
8:5 f. (with the insertion of a second condition in the form of a noun-clause); 9:3, 20, 14:7; a
frequentative imperfect referring to the past, Gn 31:8 ?????? ??????? if (ever) he said thus …,
????????? then they bare …; Ex 40:37. In Gn 42:37 the consequence (on
the condition.

??????  cf. § 107 s) precedes

(c) The jussive (or optative), e. g. Ps 137:5; cf. § 109 h.

(d) The cohortative, e. g. Gn 13:9, Jb 31:7; cf. § 108 f.

(e) The perfect consecutive (see the examples in § 112 ff and gg), e. g. 1 S 20:6  ?????????

 if thy father miss me at all, then shalt thou say, &c.; Gn 24:41, Ju 4:20; with
??
??? ???
??????
?
?

?????????? ???
a frequentative perfect consecutive, Gn 31:8 if he said (as often happened) …, then, &c.

(f) The imperfect consecutive; so perhaps Ps 59:16, if

???

??????
?

 is to be explained according to

§ 111 t.

(g) The imperative, e. g. Gn 31:50, 1 S 20:21 (with w?w apodosis, but in verse 22 simply

????), 21:10, Jb 33:5.

(h) A noun-clause, e. g. Gn 4:7, Ps 139:8, Jb 8:6, 31:26 f.

3. ??? with cohortative, e. g. Gn 30:31; cf. the passages in § 108 e.

4. ??? with infinitive, Jb 9:27 ?????????? prop. if my saying is (but probably we should read
????

).

?????

5. ??? with a noun-clause, e. g. Dt 5:22 (in the apodosis a perfect with w?w apodosis), Gn

27:46, Ju 9:15 (imperative in the apodosis); 11:9 (imperfect in the apodosis); 2 S 12:8
(cohortative in the apodosis); Ho 12:12; especially if the subject of the conditional clause be a
personal pronoun. In an affirmative sentence this pronoun is often joined to ???, in a negative
sentence to ???? (cf. on both, § 100 o), while the predicate (cf. § 116 q) is represented by a
participle, usually expressing the future, e. g. Ju 6:36 f. ??? ???? ?? ???????? if thou will save, &c.; Gn
24:49 ?? ???? ??? ???????? if ye will deal, &c.; 1 S 23:23. In Gn 24:42 f. the condition is expressed
in a more humble form by the addition of ???. With ???? Gn 43:5 ???? ???? ?????????????? but if thou wilt
not send, &c.; 20:7 (with imperative in the apodosis); Ex 8:17, 9:2 f., 1 S 19:11 (all with a
participle also in the apodosis). But ??? and  ?????
??? Gn 23:8, 1 S 20:8, 2 K 9:15, &c.,  ?????
2 K 2:10; cf. also ??????? if it be so, Gn 25:22.

 (if it be not the case) Gn 30:1, Ex 32:32, Ju 9:15,

 may also be used after ??? without a suffix; thus

????

B. ??? if, generally supposed to be originally identical with ??? behold!1 Probably, however,

??? if, is a pure Aramaism, and since the Aramaic word never has the meaning behold, it is at
least improbable that it had originally any connexion with ??? or ?????. Cf. Ex 8:22, Lv 25:20, Is
54:15, Jer 3:1, Hag 2:12, 2 Ch 7:13, and frequently in Job, as 9:11, 12, 12:14, 15, 19:7, 23:8,
40:23, always with w?w apodosis following, except in 13:15, where consequently the
meaning see is no doubt preferable.

C. ?? if, ????? (?????) if not.

1. With perfect in the protasis and apodosis (cf. § 106 p), e.g. Ju 8:19; ???? is used in the

same sense as ?? in Est 7:4, cf. Ec 6:6 (with a question in the apodosis).—With the perfect in
protasis and apodosis after ????? Gn 31:42, 43:10, Ju 14:18, 1 S 25:34, 2 S 2:27, Is 1:9. On the
other hand, in Dt 32:29 ?? with a perfect is followed by an imperfect in the apodosis, if they
were wise, they would understand this; in Mi 2:11 by a perfect consecutive.

2. With imperfect after ????? Dt 32:27, ???? probably as the modus rei repetitae, were it not
that I ever and again feared, &c.; so also the imperfect after ?? with the apodosis suppressed,
Gn 50:15 supposing that Joseph should hate us; since, according to the context, the danger
was real, the use of ?? here is strange; conversely in other cases, e.g. Ps 73:15, Jb 9:15 f.30, ??
would be more natural than ???.

3. A noun-clause occurs after ?? 2 S 18:12, 2 K 3:14, Ps 81:14, all with imperfect in the

apodosis; Jb 16:4 ??? ??, with cohortative in the apodosis.

D. ??? supposing that, if:—

1. ??? with perfect in the protasis, e.g. Nu 5:20 ???? ?? ??? ????? but thou, if thou hast gone
astray, &c.; with a frequentative perfect consecutive in the apodosis, Jb 7:13 f.; with an
imperfect consecutive, Jb 22:29.

2. ??? with imperfect in the protasis, e.g. Ps 23:4 ??????????? ??? yea, though I walk (have to
 if thou buy an

walk)…, I will fear no (???????????) evil; 37:24; Ex 21:2
Hebrew servant, six years shall he serve (but in verses 3–5 a series of definite conditions with
definite consequences is introduced by ???; so also the ??? in verse 7 is followed in verses 8–11
by the special cases with ???; cf. also verse 17 ff.); cf. Gn 4:24, 24:41, Jb 38:5; with a perfect
consecutive in the apodosis, Gn 32:18 f., Ex 18:16; with a noun-clause, Is 1:15.

??? ??????? ???
?? ????????????
?

3. ??? with a noun-clause (and imperfect in the apodosis), 2 S 19:8.

REMARKS.

1. In 2 K 5:13 the particle ??? (Masora ????, probably in the sense of my father) appears

exceptionally for ??; its meaning here is unquestionable, but its origin is obscure. Cf. the
exhaustive discussion of Delitzsch and Wetzstein on Jb 34:36, where this ??? appears to be
used as a desiderative particle.—Sometimes when one case has been already discussed,
another of the same character is added by means of ?? or, e.g. Ex 21:36 ??? ????? ?? or (another
possible case) it is known that, &c., i.e. but if it be known, &c., LXX ??? ??, Vulg. sin autem;
cf. Lv 4:23, 28, 5:1, 25:49, 2 S 18:13; with a following imperfect, Ez 14:17f.—On the
hypothetical use of ? ???? (which is interchangeable with ??? in other senses also) Lv 4:22 (in
verses 3 and 27 ???), Dt 11:27 (verse 28 ???), Jos 4:21, see the Lexicon.

1 1 There could be no doubt of their identity if ??????? in 1 S 9:7, 2 S 18:11, simply meant
if. We must, however, keep to the meaning but behold.

2. The conditional sentence is frequently found in an abridged form, where the suppressed

?????
?

????? ????? ???

clauses can be easily supplied from the context; cf. Gn 13:9, 24:49, 1 S 2:16 ????????? and if
not, i.e. and if thou wilt not give it to me, then I take it (perfect according to § 106 n) by force;
cf. 1 S 6:9. The use of ????? alone in Ju 6:13 is peculiar, as also ????? in 2 K 10:15 (where read
) in the sense of if it be so.—In 2 S 13:26, 2 K 5:17 ????? alone
with the LXX
appears to be used in the sense of if really … not, in each case with a following jussive
equivalent to may there at least, &c. (cf. § 143 d); but perhaps with Matthes, ZAW. 1903, p.
122 ff., following Kuipers, we should read ???? would that!—In 1 S 13:13, Jb 3:13 the
condition must be supplied from the preceding clause to complete the sentence introduced by
????? ???, in Jb 31:28 by ???, in 2 K 13:19 by ??.—The apodosis also appears sometimes in an
abridged form (e.g. Gn 4:24, Is 43:2) or is entirely suppressed, e.g. Gn 30:27, 38:17, 50:15
???? ???
(see y above), Ex 32:32, Ps 27:13, Jb 38:5, where properly ????? must be supplied with
as in verses 4 and 18; cf. § 167 a.—In Ps 8:4, instead of the apodosis I exclaim which we
should expect, the exclamation itself follows.

??

3. The absolute certainty with which a result is to be expected is frequently emphasized
by the insertion of ??? Is 7:9; ??? ??? 2 S 2:27, 19:7, Jb 11:15; or ????? ??? now verily, Nu 22:29, 1 S
14:30 after ??, Gn 31:42, 43:10 after ?????, Jb 8:6 after ???. On this corroborative ??? cf. such
passages as Gn 18:20, &c., and § 148 d. On ??? ??? after an oath cf. 163 d.

4. Sometimes the force of a hypothetical particle extends beyond the apodosis to a second

conditional clause, as in the case of ??? Pr 9:12, Jb 10:15, 16:6, 22:23, and ??? Is 43:2.

5. In Ex 33:20 a negative statement takes the place of a condition with a negative

consequence, for a man doth not see me and live, instead of for if a man sees me, he does not
live; cf. the similar passages, Dt 22:1, 4 thou shalt not see … and hide thyself, instead of if
thou seest … thou shalt not hide thyself.

§ 160. Concessive Clauses.

Besides the use of the imperative in the sense of a concession, meant either

seriously (§ 110 a) or mockingly (§ 110 f), and of concessive circumstantial clauses (§
141 e, § 142 d, and § 156 f), concessive clauses may be introduced—

(a) By a simple ??? if: thus Jb 9:15 with perfect, if (=though) I had been in the right; Is

1:18 and 10:22 with imperfect in reference to a contingent event.

(b) By ??? ??? yea though, Is 1:15 with imperfect; for which we find simply ??? in Is 49:15

with imperfect, yea, though these may forget, yet …; on the other hand, with perfect, Jer
36:25, Ps 95:9, Neh 6:1; finally ??? ??? even if, though, Ec 4:14.

(c) By the preposition ???? governing a complete noun-clause, as Jb 16:17  ?????? ?????????? ???
notwithstanding that no violence is in mine hands, or a verbal-clause, Is 53:9. On ???? with the
infinitive in a similar sense (equivalent to in addition to the fact that = notwithstanding that),
cf. § 119 aa, note 2.

??

§ 161. Comparative Clauses.

ZAW. ZAW, = Zeitschrift für die alttestamentliche Wissenschaft, ed. by B. Stade,
Giessen, 1881 ff., and since 1907 by K. Marti.

1. A comparison between two facts is sometimes established by simply uniting
them with w?w copulative, especially in gnomic poetry, when facts of a moral nature
are compared with those of the physical world, e.g. Jb 5:7 man is born unto trouble,
and the sons of flame fly upward, i.e. as the sparks by nature fly upward, so man, &c.;
Jb 12:11 (in an interrogative form; in 34:3 the same comparison as a statement); 14:11
f., Pr 17:3, 25:3, 26:3, 9, 14, 27:21, &c.1 Even without the connecting ?? Jb 24:19
drought and heat consume the snow waters,
sinned (cf. § 155 n); cf. Jer 17:11.

 so doth Sheol those who have

???? ??? ??

???

2. The conjunction ? ??????? (cf. § 155 g; the simple ? ???? occurs in the same sense in
Ex 10:6, 14:13, 34:18) as, quemadmodum, is used as a comparative conjunction (Ob
15), frequently with ??? so, corresponding to it in the apodosis, Is 31:4, 52:14 f..
Sometimes, however, ??? (so also) occurs even after independent statements, Is 55:9,
Jer 3:20.—Exact coincidence of two facts is expressed in Ec 5:15 by  ?? ?????????
points as.

2 in all

·

Rem. On the use of ??   as, with single nouns or pronouns to introduce comparisons, cf. 118

s; on the alleged use of ??   as a conjunction (equivalent to ? ???????), cf. § 155 g.—It is to be
further remarked that ??  —??   when used in correspondence with one another, as—so (e.g. Lv
7:7, Ju 8:18, Is 24:2, Ho 4:9; also so—as, Gn 18:25, 44:18, Dt 1:17, 1 K 22:4; in Jos 14:11, 1
S 30:24 ???—??; Ps 127:4 and often, ???—??  , cf. Jo 2:4), are not to be regarded as conjunctions,
but as virtual substantives with a following genitive; ???????? ????? ????? Nu 15:15 properly means
the like of you shall be the like of the stranger, i.e. your duty shall be (also) the stranger’s
duty; cf. Lv 24:22.

§ 162. Disjunctive Sentences.

The introduction of another possible case, excluding that which preceded, is
effected by ?? or, e.g. Ex 21:36, equivalent to the Latin vel; but also equivalent to aut
with an exclusive antithesis, 2 K 2:16; so Is 27:5 ??= it would then happen that, for
which elsewhere ??? ??.

In the sense of sive—sive we find ??—??, or ???—???, or ?????—??? (see the examples

in the Lexicon), also ??—?? Lv 5:3, Nu 9:14, Dt 24:7, Is 2:13 ff., Jer 32:20, Ps 76:7, Jb
34:29, perhaps also Ex 21:16 (but not Pr 29:9; cf. Delitzsch on the passage), and ??—??
(see § 143 e); cf. also ???—??? (in Gn 24:44 ?????—???) both—and; but ??? ???—??? ??? (in
Gn 21:26 ??? ?????— ?? ?????
 ???
questions, see § 150 g.

—???) neither—nor. On disjunctive

; Zp 1:18

???

 ...

?

1 1 On this w?w adaequationis, and in general on these proverbial comparisons, see
Delitzsch, Das Salomonische Spruchbuch, p. 9 f. Moreover, instead of entire clauses,
the nouns alone (without predicates) are frequently grouped together, e.g. Pr 25:25,
26:21, 27:21 (called by Delitzsch, the ‘emblematic Mashal’). The expressions ??? ? ??????
prop. to be counted with some one, Ps 88:5, and ??? ? ?????? to be likened with some one,
Ps 28:1, 143:7, also arise from the idea of comparison implied in grouping things
together. On this use of ??? cf. Jb 9:26, where with is equivalent to like.
2 2 In spite of its form this particle has originally nothing to do with ???, ???? all. The
expression is compounded of ??   and ???????, like the Aramaic ????????? for ??????????; cf. M.
Lambert, REJ. xxx. 47.

§ 163. Adversative and Exceptive Clauses.

1. After negative sentences (especially after prohibitions) the antithesis (but) is
introduced by ??? ???, e.g. 1 S 8:19 and they said, Nay, but we will have a king over us;
Ps 1:2, &c.; frequently also by ??? alone, e.g. Gn 18:15, 19:2, or even simply connected
with ??, Gn 17:5, ??????? as perfect consecutive; 42:10; cf. Ex 5:18.

Rem. Sometimes the negation is only virtually contained in the preceding sentence, e.g. in

the form of a rhetorical question (Mi 6:3 f.) or of conditions which are to be regarded as not
having been fulfilled (Jb 31:18); ??? or ??? ??? in such cases becomes equivalent to nay, rather.

2. Exceptive clauses, depending on another sentence, are introduced by

??? ???
???

except that, and (again after negative sentences, see a above) ??? ???1 unless; especially
??? ??? with the perfect (equivalent to unless previously) after imperfects which contain
a declaration, e.g. Gn 32:27 I will not let thee go, except thou hast previously blessed
me; Lv 22:6, Is 55:10, 65:6, Am 3:7, Ru 3:18. Finally, ??? ??????? unless, Am 3:4 (with
perfect after a rhetorical question), or simply ??????? Gn 43:3 with a noun-clause, except
your brother be with you; Is 10:4 after a rhetorical question, with a verbal-clause.

Rem. The principal statement, to which ??? ??? appends an exception, must sometimes be
supplied from the context; thus, Gn 40:14 (I desire nothing else) except that thou remember
me, equivalent to only do thou remember, &c. (cf. 106 n, note 2; but it is probably better to
read ??? for ???). Cf. Mi 6:8, where ??? ???, equivalent to nothing but, is used before an infinitive,
and Jb 42:8, equivalent to only, before a noun. Similarly when ??? ??? after an oath introduces
an emphatic assurance, e.g. in 2 K 5:20 as the Lord liveth (I can do nothing else) except I run
after him, &c.; cf. 2 S 15:21 Keth., Jer 51:14, Ru 3:12 Keth., and even without the oath, Ju
15:7; cf. the Rem. on c.

§ 164. Temporal Clauses.

1. The relations of time existing between two different actions or events are
frequently expressed without the aid of a conjunction simply by juxtaposition:—

(a) Actions or events are represented as wholly or in part simultaneous by connecting a
noun-clause with another noun-clause or verbal-clause introduced by ?? (or ???????), e.g. Gn 7:6
and Noah was six hundred years old (prop. a son of six hundred years), ????? ????????? and (i.e.
when) the flood was. This is especially the case when the predicate of the noun-clause
(frequently introduced by ??? still) is expressed by an active participle, e.g. Jb 1:16 f.  ??? ???
??? ??? ????? ??????? he was yet speaking, and there came another, &c.; see the numerous examples
in § 111 g and § 116 u. Instead of a complete noun-clause there often occurs a simple casus
pendens after ???? with a participial attribute in the sense of whenever any one …, e.g. 1 S 2:13
???????? ??? ???? ???
?? ????
?

 whenever any man offered sacrifice, then came, &c.; 2 S 2:23, &c.; see
??

1 1 Very probably this use of ??? ??? arises from the original meaning for if, surely if (???
in an affirmative sense); so evidently in Ex 22:22 as a forcible resumption of the
preceding ???. Thus, e.g. Ju 15:7 is simply surely when I have been avenged of you,
after that I will cease, equivalent to, I will not cease, until I have, &c. When the
exception follows, an ellipse must be assumed, e.g. Ru 3:18 surely (or for) when he
has finished it (then the man will rest). It is far less natural to assume such an ellipse
with ??? ??? but (before entire clauses as before single nouns); see a above.

the examples (in which the second member is generally introduced by w?w apodosis) in § 116
w.

(b) Sequence is expressed by the juxtaposition

(1) of two imperfects consecutive, e.g. Gn 24:19

??????

?? ???? ?????? ???????

 and when she had

done giving him drink, she said, &c.; 28:8 f., 29:31, 30:9, 32:26, &c.; cf. § 111 d;

(2) of a noun-clause with a passive participle as predicate, and a verbal-clause attached by

??, e.g. Gn 38:25; cf. § 116 v; in Gn 49:29 an imperative follows without ??;

(3) of two perfects (frequently with the secondary idea of rapid succession1 of the two

actions or events in past time), e.g. Gn 19:23
and (=when) Lot came, &c., cf. 1 S 9:5, 2 S 2:24; Gn 44:3 f., Ju 3:24, 15:14, 20:39 f.—In all
these examples the subject follows immediately after the connective W?w, and then the
(simple) perfect. On the other hand,

 the sun was just risen …,

??? ??? ?????

 ????? ???

?????
?

 ...

(4) a perfect consecutive follows another perfect consecutive to express the contingent
succession of future actions, e.g. Gn 44:4 ??????? ?????????? ???????????? and when thou dost overtake
them (as soon as thou shalt have overtaken), thou shalt say unto them. Naturally, examples of
this kind are very closely related to conditional sentences; see, therefore, the examples in §
112 kk and § 159 g. On the connexion of an imperfect consecutive or a perfect with detached
expressions of time (as equivalent to complete clauses), cf. § 111 b; on the imperfect
consecutive after ??????? and a statement of time, cf. § 111 g; on the perfect consecutive
following a detached statement of time, as in Ex 16:6, cf. § 112 oo.—In 1 S 29:10 an
imperative with ?? follows the perfect consecutive.

(5) The fact that one action or event has not yet taken place on the occurrence of another,
??????  (an adverb, not a conjunction) with the imperfect (according to § 107 c).

is expressed by
The apodosis, which may consist of a subject and perfect or even of a noun-clause (Gn
24:15),1 is then connected by ?? (or ???????) as in the examples above, under no. 3, e.g. Gn 19:4
(cf. Jos 2:8)
 ...
 ?????? ? ??????? ??
?? ???? ???
?
of the city … compassed, &c.; Gn 24:25.

 they had not yet lain down, and (=when) the men

??? ??

?????

???

2. Conjunctions used to introduce temporal clauses are ??? (with perfect, e.g. Gn
6:1, Ju 1:28, 16:16, 1 S 1:12; with imperfect, Gn 4:12, 12:12, 24:41, Ex 3:21, Lv 21:9,
Dt 31:21, Is 1:12, 8:19) and ? ????2 when (??? with the imperfect also=as often as, Ps 8:4;
with perfect Jb 1:5); less frequently ???3 (joined with a perfect), e.g. Gn 38:9, Nu 21:9,
Ju 6:3, Ps 41:7, 94:18, cf. also Is 24:13=quotiescunque; also in the same sense with an
imperfect, Nu 36:4; with a perfect, equivalent to the futurum exactum, Is 4:4. Other
conjunctions of time are the compounds ???? when, Gn 19:15; ? ??????? when, after that;

1 1 This secondary idea is implied here by the mere co-ordination of two independent
verbal-clauses, just as the idea of simultaneous occurrence (according to § 116 u, note
1) is implied in the co-ordination of a noun-clause with another clause. In Gn 27:30
the immediate succession is especially emphasized by ??? and the infinitive absolute,
Jacob was yet scarce gone out … then Esau his brother came; in 1 K 9:24 by ??? only
in Ps 48:6 by ??? and the addition of two more perfects without ??.
1 1 On the perfect in the protasis, which is critically doubtful, cf. § 107 c.
2 2 On ? ???? as an original demonstrative, cf. § 138 a; hence  ???? ? ????????
to that (moment)—we shall return.
3 3 Cf. the frequent use of wenn [prop. if] for wann [=when] in German.

 is properly up

?

? ????????, ??????? until (also the simple ????, e.g. Gn 38:11, Jos 2:22, 1 S 1:22 [with the
imperfect=only when, as in 2 S 10:5]); 2:5, &c.; especially in the formula  ???????????
?? ???? ???? until there was none left remaining to him (where indeed it would be very
natural to read ???? ???? the infin. constr., as elsewhere after ???????, § 114 s) Nu 21:35, Dt
3:3, Jos 8:22, 11:8 (but 1 S 14:19 while, as long as); ??? ? ???? ??? before that, Ec 12:1,
2, 6 with an imperfect, as in Pr 8:26 ??? with a perfect; ???????, ??? ? ???????? until the time
when; ? ????????????? (for which in Ez 40:1 ? ?????????; Lv 25:48, 1 S 5:9 simply ???????; Lv
14:43, Jer 41:16, Jb 42:7 simply ????) after that; ???? (prop. since that time; the
dependent clause is attached to it in the same way as the attributive clause to the
demonstrative ? ???? § 138 e) since, Gn 39:5;
??????? (for

? ???? ??? ) before, Ps 129:6.

??????  § 107 c) before;

 (and simply

????????

????

Rem. 1. With regard to the tenses used with the above conjunctions, the rules are

practically the same as those given in § 158 d for causal clauses. The perfect indicates actions
completed in the past or future (in the former case corresponding to the Latin pluperfect, §
106 f, and in the latter to the Latin futurum exactum, § 106 o), the imperfect denotes actions
occurring contingently in the future. On
historicum, cf. 107 c.

, and ??? with the imperfect as a tempus

?????? ,

????????

2. Clauses introduced by ???, ??????? or ? ????????, sometimes express a limit which is not
absolute (terminating the preceding action), but only relative, beyond which the action or state
described in the principal clause still continues; thus,  ???  with the imperfect, Ps 110:1; ???????
with the perfect, Gn 26:13, with impf. 49:10; ? ???????? with the perfect, Gn 28:15; with the
imperfect, Ps 112:8.—Like the Arab. ??????, ??? may even introduce a main clause; e.g. Ex
15:16 ???????????? prop. no doubt=thus it came to this—they passed through, i.e. so they passed
through.

3. The infinitive construct governed by a preposition (§ 114 d, e) is very frequently used
as the equivalent of a temporal clause; the infinitive with ?? may usually be rendered by when,
as, or whilst; the infinitive with ??   by when, as soon as (in Pr 10:25 followed by a noun-clause
introduced by w?w apodosis), or, when referring to the future, by if; the infinitive after ??? by
since. According to § 111 g such statements of time are generally preceded by ??????? and the
apodosis follows in the imperfect consecutive; hence in 1 S 17:55 (cf. Driver on the passage)
????????? with a simple perfect following, is unusual. On the continuation of these infinitival
constructions by means of the perfect consecutive, cf. § 112 v, and in general, § 114 r.—With
the participle, ??   appears to be used as the equivalent of a conjunction in ?? ?????? as he drew
back, Gn 38:29 (unless we should read ?? ?????? [or ?? ???? ????, cf. Gn 19:15]), and in
it budded, 40:10.

§ 165. Final Clauses.1

1. Like most of the dependent clauses hitherto treated, the final clause may also be

joined by a simple w?w copulative to the main clause, unless the final clause is
directly subordinated to the governing verb.

Examples of the connexion: (?) of a final imperfect (or jussive?) with a perfect by means

of ??, La 1:19, see § 107 q; with an interrogative sentence, 2 S 9:1, 3, Jb 38:24; with an
optative, Ps 51:9; with an imperative, 1 K 11:21; (?) of a cohortative with an imperative by ??,
Gn 29:21, 1 S 15:16, or a jussive, Neh 2:5 (§ 108 d); (?) of a jussive with an imperative by ??,

1 1 Cf. H. G. T. Mitchell, Final Constructions of Biblical Hebrew, Leipzig, 1879.

Ex 9:1, 2 S 16:11, 1 K 5:20, Ps 59:14, 86:17; with a jussive, Jb 21:19, or cohortative, § 109 f,
g (cf. also 2 S 24:21 the infinitive with ??, Jon 1:11 ??? with the 1st plur. imperf., and 2 Ch
29:10 ???????????, which are equivalent to cohortatives); (?) of an imperative with a jussive,
cohortative, or interrogative sentence by ??, § 110 i; (?) of a perfect consecutive after another
perfect consecutive, Lv 14:36; after an imperfect, § 112 m and p; similarly after a jussive, §
112 q; after an imperative, § 112 r.—On negative final clauses joined by ????? to the imperfect
(so Ex 28:43, 30:20; and 2 S 13:25 after ?????? with a jussive in the main clause) see the Rem.
on § 109 g. In Ex 28:32, 39:23 the negative final clause is simply connected by ???.—On the
use of an historical statement after verbs of commanding, where we should expect a final
clause (e.g. Neh 13:9 then I commanded, and they cleansed, equivalent to that they should
cleanse, and they cleansed; in Jb 9:7 a negative final clause is connected in this way by ?????),
cf. § 120 f.

For examples of the direct subordination of the final imperfect (without ??) see § 120 c.

?????

? ???? ???

2. Final conjunctions are

 to the end that; also simply

 Gn 12:13,
27:25, Ex 4:5, Ps 51:6, &c.; ? ???? ???????? prop. for the purpose that, Gn 27:10, and
simply ???????? Gn 27:4, Ex 9:14, 20:20; also the simple ? ????1 Dt 4:10, 40, 6:3, 32:46,
Jos 3:7, Neh 8:14 f.; negatively, ??? ? ???? Gn 11:7, 24:3, 1 K 22:16; or  ??·
negatively, ??? ?? ??????????? for the matter (purpose) that … not, Ec 7:14; ????????? with
imperfect, Ex 20:20, 2 S 14:14 that … not.—Quite exceptional is the use of ???? (if the
text be right) in Dt 33:11 ???????????, with the imperfect, equivalent to that … not [in
prose, ?????].

 Ec 3:14; also

????????

Rem. All the conjunctions here mentioned are naturally always used with the imperfect,
see §107 q (on the apparent exception in Jos 4:24, see § 74 g).—On the negative conjunctions
?? and ??? that not, lest, see §152 f and w. On the infinitive with ??2 (also
 Gn 18:19, 37:22,
&c.) as the equivalent of a final clause (Gn 11:5, 28:4, &c.), see § 114 f, h, p. On the
continuation of such infinitival constructions by means of the finite verb, see § 114 r. On the
negation of the final infinitive by ?????????, § 114 s. On the preposition ??? with a substantive or
infinitive as the equivalent of a negative final clause (Gn 31:29, 1 S 15:23, &c.), see § 119 x
and y.

????????

§ 166. Consecutive Clauses.

1. Consecutive clauses are added by means of simple w?w copulative with the
jussive,3 especially after negative and interrogative sentences, e.g. Nu 23:19  ???? ???
 God is not a man, that he should lie, and (i.e. neither) the son of
??
?????????? ????????? ????????? ?
??
man, that he should repent; Is 53:2
 who is
wise, that he may understand these things? prudent, that he may know them? Jb 5:12
?????=so that … not; in Pr 30:3 ?? is separated from the predicate by the object. In Gn
16:10 a negative consecutive clause comes after a cohortative, and in Ex 10:5 after a
perfect consecutive.—On the other hand, in Jb 9:32, 33 the jussive in the sense of a
consecutive clause is attached without W?w to the preceding negative sentence (in
verse 32 a second jussive follows, likewise without W?w, for he is not a man, as I am,

?????????? ????? ???
?

?? ??????? ????? ???

; Ho 14:10

??????????

???

1 1 In Ez 36:27 a final clause is introduced by
form of an object-clause.
2 2 On ?? as a supposed conjunction (equivalent to the Arabic li) 1 K 6:19, see § 66 i.
3 3 That such examples as ????????? are to be regarded as jussive is probable from the
analogy of Ho 14:10 and Jb 9:33.

, thus at the same time taking the

? ????

???

that I should answer him, that we should come together in judgement). On the
imperfect consecutive as expressing a logical consequence, see § 111 l; on the perfect
consecutive as a consecutive clause after a participle, see § 112 n.

2. Conjunctions introducing consecutive clauses are again (see § 157 c, note 3) ???
and ? ????=so that; especially again after interrogative sentences, according to §107 u;
cf. Nu 16:11, ??? with the imperfect, that ye murmur; but in Gn 20:10 with the perfect,
in reference to an action already completed. On ? ???? with the imperfect (or jussive)
equivalent to so that, cf. further Gn 13:16, 22:14; with perfect and imperfect, 1 K 3:12
f., with the demonstrative force clearly discernible, depending on ???; on ??? ? ????= ut
non, cf. Dt 28:35, 1 K 3:8, 2 K 9:37.

On ??? with a substantive or infinitive as the equivalent of a consecutive clause, see § 119

y.

§ 167. Aposiopesis, Anacoluthon, Involved Series of Sentences.

1. Aposiopesis is the concealment or suppression of entire sentences or clauses,

which are of themselves necessary to complete the sense,1 and therefore must be
supplied from the context. This is especially frequent after conditional clauses;
besides the examples already given in § 159 dd, cf. also Ex 32:32 (the LXX and
Samaritan supply ? ??); Nu 5:20, Ju 9:16 (in verse 19, after a long parenthesis, an
imperative follows as the apodosis to this conditional clause); 1 S 12:14 f., 2 S 5:8
(where indeed the text is probably very corrupt; cf. the addition in 1 Ch 11:6); 2 S
23:17, Ps 27:13, 1 Ch 4:10. For other examples of various kinds, see § 117 l, and
especially §147; in Aramaic, Dn 3:15.—On Gn 3:22, cf. § 152 w at the end.

2. Anacoluthon is the change from a construction which has been already begun to

one of a different kind. It is found especially after long parentheses, because the
speaker has either lost sight of the beginning of his sentence, or for the sake of
clearness purposely makes a new beginning; thus Gn 20:13, 31:52 and Ez 34:10 (cf. §
149 at the end); Nu 14:21 ff., 32:20 ff., Dt 17:2 ff., 24:1 ff., 29:21 ff., Ju 10:11
(where, after a series of intermediate sentences, the predicate I saved you is
suppressed; but the text can hardly be correct); perhaps also Is 66:18 (cf., however,
Delitzsch on the passage, which is certainly corrupt).1 On Gn 23:13 (?? with the
imperative), see § 110 e.

3. We may mention as instructive examples of involved series of sentences Gn

24:14 and 42 ff., and Gn 28:6 ff.

THE PARADIGMS.

1 1 But those cases are not to be regarded as examples of aposiopesis, in which the
answer, being closely connected with the question, is given simply in the infinitive
with ??; cf. § 147 a, note 1.
1 1 On the other hand, from the Semitic point of view the various kinds of compound
sentences are not to be regarded as instances of anacoluthon, e.g. Gn 17:14, 17, nor
even Gn 31:40 (cf. § 143).

IN the paradigms of the verbs, those forms which are to be especially noticed by
the beginner are marked throughout by an asterisk as model forms. Thus e.g. in the
strong verb the 3rd sing. fem. ???????? is the model for ???????, which likewise has only a
 is the model for ????????,
vocalic afformative, and
same way have a toneless afformative beginning with a consonant. On the other hand,
the forms ????????? and ?????????, where the affix beginning with a consonant has the tone,
stand by themselves.—In the table of the pronouns the asterisk has a different
meaning; see the footnote there.—The bracketed forms (for Paradigm G onwards) are
merely analogous formations not occurring in the Old Testament.
